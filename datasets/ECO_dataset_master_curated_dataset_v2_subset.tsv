10760178	AraC	araBAD	activator	Interestingly , @TF$ - dependent transcription initiation at the @Regulated$ promoter is increased by the cyclic AMP receptor protein ( CRP ) , a well - characterized global regulator , controlled by cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) , that activates the expression of a number of genes in response to a variety of stresses , including glucose starvation ( reviewed by Kolb et al . , 1993 ) .

21097628	MarA	marRAB	activator	For example , @TF$ binds tightly to the @Regulated$ promoter in vitro yet stimulates transcription by only ~ 3 - fold ; no significant binding to inaA can be demonstrated by gel shift experiments , yet transcription is stimulated &gt; 5 - fold .

12079504	Fnr	dmsA	activator	Thus , the left and right half - sites are equivalent in their ability to confer @TF$ - dependent activation of @Regulated$ gene expression by RNA polymerase .
9537375	CRP	gntT	activator	The results in this report also demonstrate that @Regulated$ is regulated by the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - cAMP receptor protein ( @TF$ ) complex , which was found be essential for full induction .
12079504	Fnr	cydA	repressor	This is in contrast to the requirement for the left half - site of the Fnr1 regulatory site needed for @TF$ - dependent repression at the @Regulated$ P1 promoter [ 15 ] .

15342598	RhaS	rhaT	activator	@TF$ activates transcription of the rhaBAD and @Regulated$ operons by binding as a dimer to sites that overlap the 35 hexamers of the promoters by 4 bp and extend upstream to 81 and 82 , respectively ( see Fig . 1 for the rhaBAD promoter ) ( 10 , 45 ) .
2231717	AraC	araE	activator	Studies of @Regulated$ transcription in vitro confirm the results in vivo and show that promoter activity is directly stimulated by @TF$ and CRP ( Stoner &amp; Schleif , 1983 ) .
2231717	CRP	araE	activator	Studies of @Regulated$ transcription in vitro confirm the results in vivo and show that promoter activity is directly stimulated by AraC and @TF$ ( Stoner &amp; Schleif , 1983 ) .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	Hence , in this work , we used in vivo and in vitro methods to investigate the determinants needed for @TF$ - dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter .
15342598	RhaR	rhaSR	activator	Similarly , @TF$ activates transcription of the @Regulated$ operon by binding as a dimer to a site that overlaps the RNAP binding site by 4 bp and extends upstream to 82 ( Fig . 1 ) ( 43 ) .

12060687	CRP	araBAD	activator	AraC - dependent transcription initiation at the @Regulated$ promoter is increased by @TF$ , which binds to a single DNA site upstream of I1 and I2 ( 11 ) .
11073923	CRP	rhaSR	regulator	To explore the origin of the indirect effect , we tested whether @TF$ was involved in regulation of @Regulated$ expression .

19251855	NarL	ynfE	repressor	Figure 4 shows autoradiographs from electromobility shift assays designed to investigate how @TF$ represses FNR - dependent activation of the @Regulated$ promoter .
12675795	CRP	melAB	activator	MelRdependent activation of the @Regulated$ promoter requires the binding of MelR subunits to four 18 bp sites and the binding of a single @TF$ dimer to a low - affinity target sequence ( Belyaeva et al . , 2000 ; Wade et al . , 2001 ; see Fig . 1A ) .
12675795	MelR	melAB	activator	MelRdependent activation of the @Regulated$ promoter requires the binding of @TF$ subunits to four 18 bp sites and the binding of a single CRP dimer to a low - affinity target sequence ( Belyaeva et al . , 2000 ; Wade et al . , 2001 ; see Fig . 1A ) .
12079504	Fnr	dmsA	regulator	Thus , the @Regulated$ promoter exhibits a preference for - 41.5 target sites like other @TF$ - regulated class II promoters [ 16 ] .
11395452	SoxR	soxS	activator	While the @Regulated$ gene is under the redox - regulated , positive control of @TF$ , marA is under negative control by MarR , a repressor whose DNA - binding activity is regulated by the binding of small molecules with toxic effects ( 1 , 31 , 39 ) .
12100559	MarA	nfnB	activator	Transcription of @Regulated$ is greatly increased by induced or constitutive chromosomal expression of @TF$ but is unaltered by constitutive expression of chromosomal SoxS and Rob .
15150242	ArgP	yggA	regulator	Our results indicate that @Regulated$ encodes an @TF$ - regulated Arg exporter in E . coli .
24593230	ChiX	chiP	repressor	As the chb transcript accumulates , @TF$ pairing with the intercistronic chbBC mRNA elicits the degradation of the sRNA resulting in the progressive relief of @Regulated$ repression ( Figueroa - Bossi et al . , 2009 ; Overgaard et al . , 2009 ) .
15743943	NanR	yjhA	regulator	We show in this work that @Regulated$ is indeed regulated by @TF$ and several other regulators and that it encodes a Neu5Ac - specific channel .
19906180	ArgP	argO	activator	Expression of the E . coli @Regulated$ gene is activated by @TF$ , also known as IciA , which is a transcriptional activator of the LysR type transcriptional regulator family ( Nandineni and Gowrishankar , 2004 ; Laishram and Gowrishankar , 2007 ) .
10760178	MelR	melAB	activator	In subsequent work ( Williams et al . , 1994 ) , we were able to prove that @TF$ binding to both these sites ( called Site 1 and Site 2 ; see Fig . 1A ) is necessary for melibiose - dependent activation of the @Regulated$ promoter in vivo .

19906180	ArgP	argO	activator	The L - leucine concentration was set at 7 mM , corresponding to the concentration of total leucine in cells grown in © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 74 , 1513 – 1526Lrp and @TF$ activation of @Regulated$ transcription 1517 leucine - supplemented medium ( Quay et al . , 1977 ) .
17449618	NsrR	hmpA	regulator	Operons observed to be differentially expressed include not only all four of the transcripts , @Regulated$ , ytfE , ygbA , and hcp - hcr , known or predicted to be @TF$ - regulated ( 4 , 40 ) , but also other transcripts predicted to be regulated by nitrite or RNS generated from nitrite , for example , nitric oxide ( 11 ) .
9696769	Fnr	napF	activator	This @TF$ ( D154A ) protein was able to activate ( @Regulated$ - lacZ ) expression in vivo ( data not shown ) .
17449618	NsrR	ygbA	regulator	Operons observed to be differentially expressed include not only all four of the transcripts , hmpA , ytfE , @Regulated$ , and hcp - hcr , known or predicted to be @TF$ - regulated ( 4 , 40 ) , but also other transcripts predicted to be regulated by nitrite or RNS generated from nitrite , for example , nitric oxide ( 11 ) .
17449618	NsrR	ytfE	regulator	Operons observed to be differentially expressed include not only all four of the transcripts , hmpA , @Regulated$ , ygbA , and hcp - hcr , known or predicted to be @TF$ - regulated ( 4 , 40 ) , but also other transcripts predicted to be regulated by nitrite or RNS generated from nitrite , for example , nitric oxide ( 11 ) .
7643383	Fnr	aeg	activator	These observations confirm the importance of the 64.5 sequence in the @TF$ - dependent induction of @Regulated$ - 46.5 operon expression .
16478729	MarA	hdeA	repressor	Because previous studies have shown that the @TF$ - binding sites of two other repressed promoters ( @Regulated$ and purA ) lie in a backward orientation ( 20 ) and either partially or completely overlap the - 35 hexamer , we examined whether the putative rob marbox might be in a similar configuration and position .
16478729	MarA	purA	repressor	Because previous studies have shown that the @TF$ - binding sites of two other repressed promoters ( hdeA and @Regulated$ ) lie in a backward orientation ( 20 ) and either partially or completely overlap the - 35 hexamer , we examined whether the putative rob marbox might be in a similar configuration and position .
12218041	MetJ	metD	regulator	The three @Regulated$ genes are regulated by the @TF$ repressor .
9409145	AraC	araBAD	activator	( ii ) Mutations within residues in this region in @TF$ ( Cys204 3 Tyr , Ser208 3 Ala , Arg210 3 Cys , and His212 3 Tyr or Ala ) reduced binding to and decreased transcriptional activation from the P @Regulated$ promoter ( 26 – 28 , 39 , 78 ) .
17449618	NsrR	ydbC	activator	In the case of the @Regulated$ promoter , the differences in transcript levels between the two transformants were at least as great as those for the NsrRrepressed genes , making P ydbE a prime candidate for direct activation by @TF$ .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	Next , we attempted to reproduce @TF$ - dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter in vitro .
15743943	CpxR	nanC	regulator	@Regulated$ expression was predicted to be regulated by the two - component regulatory system @TF$ - CpxA by transcriptome analysis ( 16 ) .
12067348	CRP	acnA	regulator	The – 111 to – 91 site overlaps sequences identified as binding the anaerobic regulators , ArcA and FNR , and the catabolite regulator @TF$ which have been shown to regulate the @Regulated$ P2 promoter ( Cunningham et al . , 1997 ) .
18502871	ArgP	dapB	activator	As shown in Fig . 2 , induction of @TF$ synthesis was soon followed by a sharp stimulation of @Regulated$ lacZ transcription .
8825783	IciA	dnaA	activator	In vivo S1 nuclease - protection assays ( Fig . 4 ) and in vitro run - off transcription assays ( Figs 5 and 6 ) indicate that @TF$ protein specifically activates transcription from @Regulated$ promoter 1P .
17449618	NsrR	hcp	repressor	The microarray data for the other promoters that are apparently activated by @TF$ must be evaluated cautiously , however , because few of these transcripts encode proteins known or suspected to be involved in the response to RNS , and most of the differences were much smaller ( typically two - to threefold apparent activation ) than the 30 - fold repression of ytfE , the 14 - fold repression of hmpA , and the up - to - 15 - fold repression of @Regulated$ .
17449618	NsrR	hmpA	repressor	The microarray data for the other promoters that are apparently activated by @TF$ must be evaluated cautiously , however , because few of these transcripts encode proteins known or suspected to be involved in the response to RNS , and most of the differences were much smaller ( typically two - to threefold apparent activation ) than the 30 - fold repression of ytfE , the 14 - fold repression of @Regulated$ , and the up - to - 15 - fold repression of hcp .
10760179	MelR	melR	repressor	The figure also shows the measured amount of @TF$ - dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter on the KK81 fragment carrying the different Site R substitutions .
17449618	NsrR	ytfE	repressor	The microarray data for the other promoters that are apparently activated by @TF$ must be evaluated cautiously , however , because few of these transcripts encode proteins known or suspected to be involved in the response to RNS , and most of the differences were much smaller ( typically two - to threefold apparent activation ) than the 30 - fold repression of @Regulated$ , the 14 - fold repression of hmpA , and the up - to - 15 - fold repression of hcp .
19906180	Lrp	argO	regulator	Three potential @TF$ binding sites can be found in the @Regulated$ control region ( Pot - box 1 , 2 and 3 ; Fig . 1 ) .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	The experiment illustrated in Figure 2 shows that @TF$ has little or no effect on the synthesis of RNA - 1 but represses synthesis of the transcript from the @Regulated$ promoter .
12791142	MarR	marA	regulator	The transcription of the @Regulated$ gene is regulated by the repressor @TF$ ( Alekshun and Levy , 1997 ) .
10760179	MelR	melR	repressor	The results shown in Fig . 4 indicate that , with the shorter KK101 fragment , repression of the @Regulated$ promoter by @TF$ differs from the repression found with the longer KK81 fragment .
9393706	Rob	marRAB	activator	In a strain with a wild - type chromosomal @Regulated$ operon , @TF$ activates the promoter , and therefore the rob + mar + strain produces more MarR repressor than the rob mar + strain .
19906180	Lrp	ilvIH	regulator	For example , binding of @TF$ to the isolated strong binding site 2 of the @Regulated$ control region occurred in the nM range ( Cui et al . , 1996 ) but , in contrast , binding to site 2 of the pap operon could not be detected by EMSA , although this site was successfully used for the growth of co - crystals ( de los Rios and Perona , 2007 ) .
18502871	ArgP	dapB	regulator	@TF$ binds a site upstream of the @Regulated$ promoter .
9657988	RelA	eda	activator	Nystrom showed that induction of the @TF$ protein results in high expression of @Regulated$ ( 47 ) .
9537375	CRP	gntT	activator	In summary , these results demonstrate that @Regulated$ is positively regulated by @TF$ .
10760179	MelR	melR	repressor	We reasoned that some part of the melAB promoter might be responsible for the high level of @TF$ dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter seen with the KK81 fragment .
8995231	DnaA	dnaA	repressor	2 When the two @Regulated$ promoters were repressed by @TF$ protein , IciA protein was able to restore transcription from the 1P promoter with little effect on transcription from the 2P promoter ( 25 ) .
8995231	IciA	dnaA	activator	2 When the two @Regulated$ promoters were repressed by DnaA protein , @TF$ protein was able to restore transcription from the 1P promoter with little effect on transcription from the 2P promoter ( 25 ) .
2543976	MetR	metH	activator	The results of the present study extend these observations and show that the @TF$ protein also stimulates the in vitro expression of @Regulated$ and that both the MetE and MetH proteins synthesized in vitro are enzymatically active .
12067348	MarA	b1452	activator	Thus , stimulation of @Regulated$ was dependent on @TF$ and a region ( – 131 to – 111 ) identified as a potential binding site for the activators . map and mdaB .
8995231	DnaA	dnaA	repressor	The mechanism of IciA protein stimulation of transcription from @Regulated$ promoter 1P in the presence of inhibitory amounts of @TF$ protein was examined .
8995231	IciA	dnaA	activator	The mechanism of @TF$ protein stimulation of transcription from @Regulated$ promoter 1P in the presence of inhibitory amounts of DnaA protein was examined .
10760179	MelR	melR	repressor	Results in Fig . 5 show that @TF$ - dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter is little altered by the changes in Site 1 ( KK81S3 ) or Site 1 0 ( KK81S4 ) .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	@TF$ - dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter carried by each derivative was then measured , as above .
21890697	ArgP	cadBA	regulator	@TF$ and @Regulated$ regulation .
11073923	CRP	rhaBAD	activator	RESULTS @TF$ both directly and indirectly activates @Regulated$ .
8825783	IciA	dnaA	activator	Hwang we have shown that @TF$ protein activates transcription from the promoter 1P of the @Regulated$ gene .
10760179	MelR	melR	repressor	Thus , when @TF$ - binding Site 2 is altered in the KK81 fragment , the pattern of MelRdependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter is similar to that seen with the shorter KK101 fragment ( Fig . 4 ) .
20023096	CRP	araB	regulator	On the other hand , activation of the P @Regulated$ promoter was delayed when glucose was present , consistent with the regulation of this promoter also by @TF$ ( 6 ) .
17238917	NanR	fimB	activator	This suggests that IHF binding to ibs has a small inhibitory effect on the ability of @TF$ to activate @Regulated$ expression .
21890697	ArgP	lysP	activator	Since our findings indicated that @TF$ is needed for activation of @Regulated$ transcription , we tested whether cadBA expression would be rendered Lys independent even in the argP mutant .
10601216	Fnr	adhE	regulator	Thus , it seems that @TF$ can regulate @Regulated$ expression from the downstream transcriptional start site only in the physical absence of the upstream region .
7643383	NarP	aeg	activator	The results suggest that the @TF$ protein specifically interacts with the 44.5 region in order to activate @Regulated$ - 46.5 operon expression .
12100559	MarA	nfnB	activator	An important observation was that purified @TF$ was able to activate transcription in vitro of @Regulated$ .
11395452	SoxS	fldB	activator	Of the remaining seven @TF$ - activated genes , five ( nfo , rimK , tolC , @Regulated$ , and mdaA ) were activated with values below threshold while one ( ribA ) appeared slightly repressed .
14701822	MarA	hdeA	repressor	These results together indicated that marbox 3 , and particularly its RE2 , was critical for repression of @Regulated$ by @TF$ .
11395452	SoxS	mdaA	activator	Of the remaining seven @TF$ - activated genes , five ( nfo , rimK , tolC , fldB , and @Regulated$ ) were activated with values below threshold while one ( ribA ) appeared slightly repressed .
11395452	SoxS	nfo	activator	Of the remaining seven @TF$ - activated genes , five ( @Regulated$ , rimK , tolC , fldB , and mdaA ) were activated with values below threshold while one ( ribA ) appeared slightly repressed .
11395452	SoxS	ribA	repressor	Of the remaining seven @TF$ - activated genes , five ( nfo , rimK , tolC , fldB , and mdaA ) were activated with values below threshold while one ( @Regulated$ ) appeared slightly repressed .
11395452	SoxS	rimK	activator	Of the remaining seven @TF$ - activated genes , five ( nfo , @Regulated$ , tolC , fldB , and mdaA ) were activated with values below threshold while one ( ribA ) appeared slightly repressed .
11395452	SoxS	tolC	activator	Of the remaining seven @TF$ - activated genes , five ( nfo , rimK , @Regulated$ , fldB , and mdaA ) were activated with values below threshold while one ( ribA ) appeared slightly repressed .
17238917	IHF	fimB	activator	Taking these results together with those presented above , it is concluded that the cooperative interaction of NagC bound to O NC1 and O NC2 , with @TF$ bound to the site identified in this work , forms a nucleoprotein complex that activates @Regulated$ expression .
17238917	NagC	fimB	activator	Taking these results together with those presented above , it is concluded that the cooperative interaction of @TF$ bound to O NC1 and O NC2 , with IHF bound to the site identified in this work , forms a nucleoprotein complex that activates @Regulated$ expression .
21441513	LysR	lysP	regulator	Analysis of the @Regulated$ promoter revealed a conserved T - N 11 - A motif , a typical binding site of @TF$ - type transcriptional regu - VOL .
15534208	NagC	fimB	activator	The identification of @TF$ as an activator of @Regulated$ expression indicated that the expression of the recombinase would be inhibited by GlcNAc .
11742992	CRP	melAB	activator	Thus , we have investigated the involvement of aCTD in @TF$ - dependent activation at the @Regulated$ promoter by using a preparation of E . coli RNAP , reconstituted with truncated a subunits that lack the C - terminal 73 residues .
8995231	DnaA	dnaA	repressor	RNA polymerase binding to the region containing @Regulated$ promoter 1P ( lane 3 ) was inhibited by @TF$ protein ( lane 4 ) .
12067348	MarA	yhbW	activator	Unlike most other promoters , @Regulated$ seemed to require additional sequence upstream of the – 76 to – 57 site for maximum activation by @TF$ , SoxS and Rob .
17238917	NagC	fimB	activator	Thus , NanR and @TF$ appear to activate @Regulated$ expression independently .
17238917	NanR	fimB	activator	Thus , @TF$ and NagC appear to activate @Regulated$ expression independently .
17238917	NanR	fimB	activator	Accordingly we reasoned that a loss of @Regulated$ expression as a result of decreased NagC activity in the D3 background might be compensated for by enhanced activation by @TF$ for some reason .
10760179	MelR	melR	repressor	However , the situation is not so simple , and , in the absence of melibiose , efficient repression requires DNA sequences upstream of the @Regulated$ promoter ; in particular , @TF$ binding Site 2 is required .
11742992	CRP	melAB	activator	However , @TF$ is able to activate transcription from the @Regulated$ promoter with RNAP containing both fulllength and truncated a subunits .
2543976	MetR	metE	activator	It should be mentioned that Plamann and Stauffer ( 35 ) noted that a deletion in this area resulted in a loss of @TF$ activation of the in vivo synthesis of a @Regulated$ - lac fusion protein .
19007420	GalR	galP	repressor	The mutation in nagO1 behaved as expected : expression was higher in glycerol , giving a © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 71 , 146 – 157NagC , @TF$ and GalS repression at @Regulated$ 151 value comparable to the nagC mutation and expression was strongly increased by growth on galactose .
19007420	GalS	galP	repressor	The mutation in nagO1 behaved as expected : expression was higher in glycerol , giving a © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 71 , 146 – 157NagC , GalR and @TF$ repression at @Regulated$ 151 value comparable to the nagC mutation and expression was strongly increased by growth on galactose .
10760179	MelR	melR	repressor	Together with the present results , this suggests a simple model ( illustrated in Fig . 6 ) to explain how @TF$ - dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter is modulated by the elements at the upstream melAB promoter .
15342598	RhaR	rhaSR	activator	@TF$ residues D276 , E284 , and D285 are important for @Regulated$ transcription activation .
11073923	CRP	rhaSR	activator	We hypothesize that @TF$ binding to some or all of these sites may influence transcription activation at @Regulated$ .
8995231	IciA	dnaA	activator	@TF$ protein stimulates RNA polymerase binding to @Regulated$ promoter 1P in the presence of inhibitory amounts of DnaA protein .
7545108	PurR	purB	repressor	An alternative explanation is that repression occurs by the ' roadblock ' mechanism described for @TF$ repression of the @Regulated$ promoter ( He and Zalkin , 1992 ) .
6262769	CAP	araBAD	regulator	Schematic representation of regulation of @Regulated$ and araC promoters by @TF$ , P1 , and P2 . negative control of Pc by P1 and P2 .

24593230	ChiX	chiP	repressor	Translation of the @Regulated$ mRNA is repressed by base - pairing with the @TF$ sRNA .
17449618	NsrR	hcp	repressor	These data clearly indicate that the @Regulated$ promoter is activated by FNR and repressed by @TF$ .
9537375	GntR	gntT	repressor	In summary , the results clearly demonstrate that both operators are required for repression of @Regulated$ by @TF$ .
11004182	NarP	nrfA	activator	Finally , either NarL or @TF$ was able to activate @Regulated$ - lacZ expression independently of the other , while only NarL could repress expression .
17449618	NsrR	ytfE	repressor	In the case of the @Regulated$ promoter , repression by @TF$ is the dominant regulatory mechanism , though there is also some evidence for anaerobic repression by FNR , as reported previously ( 25 ) .
7545108	NagC	nag	repressor	It is interesting to compare the characteristics of NagCmediated repression of @Regulated$ degradative genes with the @TF$ - mediated activation of the glm genes .
8501030	NarL	aeg	repressor	These results show that the NarP protein activates F ( @Regulated$ - 46.5 - lacZ ) expression in response to nitrate and nitrite and that the @TF$ protein antagonizes this activation .
21441513	ArgP	lysP	regulator	To confirm the role of @TF$ in the regulation of @Regulated$ transcription , the argP gene was cloned into plasmid pBAD24 under the control of the arabinose - inducible promoter ( 18 ) .
12923080	NarL	fdnG	activator	At low to intermediate levels of nitrate ( 2 to 6 mM ) NarP appeared to antagonize the ability of @TF$ to activate @Regulated$ operon expression .
10850996	Rob	inaA	regulator	Both @Regulated$ and marRAB are known @TF$ - regulated genes ( 5 , 21 ) .
10850996	Rob	marRAB	regulator	Both inaA and @Regulated$ are known @TF$ - regulated genes ( 5 , 21 ) .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	Results in Figure 3C show that Val273 @TF$ gives a small enhancement in repression of the @Regulated$ promoter carrying the 13T substitution in site R , B .
17449618	NsrR	nrfA	regulator	@TF$ : sixth protein to regulate transcription factor at P @Regulated$ .
21070640	NagC	fimB	repressor	First , repression of nanC and @Regulated$ divergent transcripts by @TF$ has been observed both in vivo and in vitro [ 32 ] .
21070640	NagC	nanC	repressor	First , repression of @Regulated$ and fimB divergent transcripts by @TF$ has been observed both in vivo and in vitro [ 32 ] .
21890697	ArgP	dnaA	regulator	In its description as IciA , @TF$ has been reported to regulate @Regulated$ and nrdA transcription ( 20 , 27 – 29 ) .
17238917	IHF	fimB	activator	It thus seems likely that the ability of @TF$ alone to activate @Regulated$ expression is enhanced in the D3 mutant background .
21890697	ArgP	nrdA	regulator	In its description as IciA , @TF$ has been reported to regulate dnaA and @Regulated$ transcription ( 20 , 27 – 29 ) .
2962192	AraC	araBAD	activator	Therefore , arafl is essential for both repression and activation and acts as a switch to allow both the repressor and the activator forms of the @TF$ protein to control the @Regulated$ promoter .
2962192	AraC	araBAD	repressor	Therefore , arafl is essential for both repression and activation and acts as a switch to allow both the repressor and the activator forms of the @TF$ protein to control the @Regulated$ promoter .
16478729	MarA	rob	repressor	However , in the presence of @TF$ the @Regulated$ transcript levels decreased over time , but as expected the levels of the gnd transcript ( the control ) remained unaffected ( Fig . 6C ) .
16478729	MarA	rob	repressor	Thus @TF$ is able to repress the @Regulated$ promoter after the preformed open complex clears the promoter .
24593230	NagC	chbBCARFG	repressor	The latter step is critical for the initiation of the entire induction cascade , as the @Regulated$ operon itself is repressed by @TF$ ( Plumbridge and Pellegrini , 2004 ) .
17238917	NanR	fimB	activator	Thus the D3 region is not apparently required for @TF$ to activate @Regulated$ expression in the wildtype background , and it could contain specific sequences that inhibit this .
2543976	MetJ	metE	repressor	Thus , binding of @TF$ to this area could serve to simultaneously repress both metR and @Regulated$ expression .
2543976	MetJ	metR	repressor	Thus , binding of @TF$ to this area could serve to simultaneously repress both @Regulated$ and metE expression .
11601842	MarA	micF	activator	A common phenotype associated with transcriptional activation of @Regulated$ by Rob , SoxS and @TF$ is multiple antibiotic resistance .
11601842	Rob	micF	activator	A common phenotype associated with transcriptional activation of @Regulated$ by @TF$ , SoxS and MarA is multiple antibiotic resistance .
11601842	SoxS	micF	activator	A common phenotype associated with transcriptional activation of @Regulated$ by Rob , @TF$ and MarA is multiple antibiotic resistance .
11742992	MelR	melAB	activator	@TF$ and CRP interact at the @Regulated$ promoter to activate transcription , but this interaction can be exploited to repress transcription ( Figure 3 ) .
11073923	CRP	rhaSR	activator	Deletion of crp ( Table 5 ) resulted in a level of expression from each fusion that was similar to the expression from ( rhaS - lacZ ) 90 in the crp strain background , supporting our hypothesis that full @Regulated$ activation requires @TF$ .
17449618	NsrR	nrfA	regulator	Two approaches were used to confirm that @TF$ is this sixth factor that regulates P @Regulated$ .
22101843	DcuR	dcuB	activator	Therefore , the induction of @Regulated$ depends on functional DcuS / @TF$ .
14701822	MarA	hdeA	repressor	The physiological significance of the repression of purA and @Regulated$ by @TF$ is not known .
14701822	MarA	purA	repressor	The physiological significance of the repression of @Regulated$ and hdeA by @TF$ is not known .
2543976	MetJ	metE	repressor	These latter results , together with the experiments described here showing that @TF$ binds to this region of DNA , strongly suggest that the - 8 to + 27 region is involved in @Regulated$ repression .
11073923	CRP	rhaSR	activator	We assayed the plasmid - borne lacZ fusions carrying these mutations to determine whether either of these two @TF$ sites was required for @Regulated$ activation .
21441513	ArgP	lysP	activator	These results indicated that @TF$ is responsible for the transcriptional activation of @Regulated$ in the absence of lysine .
15534208	NanR	yjhA	repressor	101 no . 46 16325 @Regulated$ encodes an outer membrane channel that can facilitate Neu 5 Ac uptake ( G . Condemine , personal communication ) , and this gene is also repressed strongly by @TF$ , an effect which is modulated by NagC binding to the NagC1 site .
11742992	CRP	melAB	activator	Similarly , at the @Regulated$ promoter , activation by @TF$ appears to be dependent on direct protein ± protein interactions with MelR .
14701822	MarA	purA	repressor	The repression of @Regulated$ by @TF$ was quantitatively similar in vivo and in vitro , whereas that of hdeA was greater in vivo ( ~ 6 – 25 - fold ) than in vitro ( ~ 1.7 - fold ) .
3041410	AraC	araBAD	repressor	One of the ara loops , that involving @TF$ bound at araO2 and araI , was previously shown to generate repression of @Regulated$ ( 5 - 7 ) .
16478729	MarA	rob	repressor	This study demonstrates that @TF$ can repress the expression of the @Regulated$ gene both in vivo and in vitro via a marbox sequence located within its promoter .
2231717	AraC	araBAD	activator	Dominant - negative @TF$ mutants that fail to activate transcription of @Regulated$ were selected , and their interactions with specific bases of the binding site were probed with chemically modified DNA .
10747919	MelR	melAB	activator	We suppose that this improvement in @TF$ binding is responsible for the increased @Regulated$ promoter activity in the W3133 - 2 mutant , although we cannot prove that it is solely responsible .
9696769	NarP	napF	activator	It is possible that @TF$ and Fnr may activate @Regulated$ transcription synergistically whereas Fnr and NarL cannot , as discussed below .
11742992	CRP	melAB	activator	In conclusion , MelR and @TF$ bind to the @Regulated$ promoter co - operatively to adjacent sites in order to activate transcription in a co - dependent manner .
11742992	MelR	melAB	activator	In conclusion , @TF$ and CRP bind to the @Regulated$ promoter co - operatively to adjacent sites in order to activate transcription in a co - dependent manner .
8898382	MetJ	mefA	repressor	The @Regulated$ operator had the highest apparent affinity in these assays , where the repression complex would be expected to contain at least four @TF$ dimers , compared with two in the minimal complexes formed on the synthetic sites .
15066032	NagC	chbB	activator	In a nagC strain , the threefold increase in @Regulated$ – lacZ expression compared with the wild type is , as expected , eliminated by the @TF$ plasmid .
17238917	NagC	fimB	activator	While the basis for this effect is uncertain , it is nevertheless evident that neither NanR nor @TF$ requires the wild - type segment of D7 DNA in order to be able to activate @Regulated$ expression .

2962192	AraC	araBAD	activator	The extent of @TF$ stimulation of @Regulated$ is at least 25 - fold larger .
1560456	AraC	araBAD	activator	In vitro activation of the transcription of @Regulated$ operon by @TF$ activator .
22101843	DcuR	citC	activator	A 3.4 - fold decrease of @Regulated$ - lacZ induction was observed when @TF$ was inactivated ( IMW554 ) .
17238917	NagC	fimB	activator	To test this hypothesis further , and to examine the effect of operator - to - promoter distance on @TF$ activation , the effect of deleting the 274 bp region ( D7 ) described above on @Regulated$ expression was also analysed ( Fig . 8 ) .
15066032	NagC	chbB	repressor	So there is no strong repression of @Regulated$ – lacZ by plasmid - encoded @TF$ .
17238917	NanR	fimB	activator	The results of this analysis confirm this assertion , and show additionally that NagC is also better able to We previously presented evidence suggesting that the D2 region , and hence @TF$ and NagC , could activate @Regulated$ expression by blocking the inhibitory effect of additional cis - acting element ( s ) positioned closer to nanC ( El - Labany et al . , 2003 ) .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	Results illustrated in Figure 5B show that @TF$ - dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter is unaffected when CRP binding at this target is prevented .
8636021	MarA	inaA	activator	Thus , maximum activation of the mar regulon promoter @Regulated$ depends on the autostimulatory effect of @TF$ on the mar operon .
7545108	AraC	araBAD	repressor	The @TF$ protein activates and represses the @Regulated$ genes , depending upon the presence of the inducer and cAMP / CAP which change the occupancy of the different sites ( Reeder and Schleif , 1993 and references therein ) .
19007420	GalR	galP	repressor	Although a similar arrangement of sites around the transcription initiation regions of other genes of the gal regulon might have suggested that they all are regulated by a similar mechanism to galE ( Weickert and Adhya , 1993a , b ; Semsey et al . , 2007 ) , the results presented in this paper demonstrate that repression of the @Regulated$ gene , is mediated by a distinctly different nucleoprotein complex involving NagC as well as @TF$ and GalS and including at least 280 bp of DNA .
19007420	GalS	galP	repressor	Although a similar arrangement of sites around the transcription initiation regions of other genes of the gal regulon might have suggested that they all are regulated by a similar mechanism to galE ( Weickert and Adhya , 1993a , b ; Semsey et al . , 2007 ) , the results presented in this paper demonstrate that repression of the @Regulated$ gene , is mediated by a distinctly different nucleoprotein complex involving NagC as well as GalR and @TF$ and including at least 280 bp of DNA .

9537375	GntR	gntT	repressor	During the course of this work , it became apparent that @TF$ might affect @Regulated$ expression by a mechanism that is independent of negative control by operator binding as well as activation by cAMP - CRP .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	This change confers partial CRP independence on the @Regulated$ promoter ( data not shown ) and also causes a small reduction in @TF$ - dependent repression .
22465792	Rob	fumC	activator	Table 1 shows that two amino acid residues of 70 R4 are required for @TF$ - dependent activation of @Regulated$ and that only one is required for activation of micF .
22465792	Rob	micF	activator	Table 1 shows that two amino acid residues of 70 R4 are required for @TF$ - dependent activation of fumC and that only one is required for activation of @Regulated$ .
17449618	NsrR	nrfA	repressor	The data from independent duplicate cultures were completely consistent with @TF$ repression of P @Regulated$ [ 1,200 and 1,270 nmol of o - nitrophenyl -- D - galactopyranoside hydrolyzed min 1 ( mg bacterial dry mass ) 1 for the pGIT1 transformant compared with 180 and 230 units for the pGIT8 transformant ] .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	Results illustrated in Figure 5B show that the @TF$ - dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter in the TB210 fragment is unchanged in the TB211 and TB222 derivatives .
11601842	OmpR	micF	activator	Other unknowns are how @TF$ activates @Regulated$ transcription while binding at far upstream sequences , i . e . in the - 156 to - 216 region ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) .
15066032	NagC	chbB	repressor	Results are the mean of two independent cultures . © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 52 , 437 – 449Regulation of the @Regulated$ promoter 443 represses weakly by itself and strongly in the presence of nagC + , implying that part of the repression by ChbR involves enhancing the binding of @TF$ to its promoter proximal site .
17238917	NagC	fimB	activator	Discussion We showed in earlier work that @Regulated$ expression , and hence the OFF - to - ON phase switching of type 1 fimbriation , is activated by NanR and @TF$ and hence repressed Fig . 9 .
17238917	NanR	fimB	activator	Discussion We showed in earlier work that @Regulated$ expression , and hence the OFF - to - ON phase switching of type 1 fimbriation , is activated by @TF$ and NagC and hence repressed Fig . 9 .
9696769	NarP	napF	activator	However , the @Regulated$ control region has a very different architecture , with an Fnr - binding site centered at position 64.5 and activation by @TF$ being mediated by a binding site downstream , at position 44.5 ( Fig . 1 ) .
11601842	IHF	ompC	repressor	However , in vitro experiments show @TF$ to repress @Regulated$ transcription from two of its three promoters .
19376854	RfaH	waaP	regulator	In the previous regulatory model , the expression of @Regulated$ and waaY was regulated by @TF$ ( SfrB ) , an antiterminator protein , and this regulation was achieved over the whole transcript from the top promoter in front of waaQ ( 29 ) .

10760178	MelR	melAB	activator	Strikingly , all induction is lost with the JK14 fragment , showing that @TF$ binding to Site 1 and Site 1 0 is essential for activation of the @Regulated$ promoter .
17238917	NagC	fimB	activator	NanR and @TF$ activate @Regulated$ expression by binding to operator sequences ( O NR and O NC1 respectively ; Fig . 1 ) situated further upstream of the regulated promoter than is usual in bacteria .
17238917	NanR	fimB	activator	@TF$ and NagC activate @Regulated$ expression by binding to operator sequences ( O NR and O NC1 respectively ; Fig . 1 ) situated further upstream of the regulated promoter than is usual in bacteria .

17238917	CRP	nanC	activator	Furthermore , as NagC binding to O NC1 prevents @TF$ - dependent activation of @Regulated$ ( Condemine et al . , 2005 ) , this study should enhance our understanding of the regulation of this gene as well .
19245365	NarL	ogt	activator	In the second part of the present study , we investigated the E . coli @Regulated$ promoter , which Constantinidou et al . [ 11 ] had also found to be induced by @TF$ independently of FNR .
11004182	NarL	nrfA	repressor	Therefore , the 22 heptamer site is a critical site for mediating @TF$ repression of @Regulated$ gene expression .
17238917	NagC	fimB	activator	Considered together , these data show that IHF promotes an interaction between @TF$ bound to O NC1 and O NC2 , forming a stable nucleoprotein complex that activates @Regulated$ expression .
9393706	Rob	fumC	activator	Previously , overexpression of @TF$ was shown to induce multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance phenotypes ( 3 ) , to activate expression of @Regulated$ , inaA , and sodA in vivo ( 3 ) , and to activate the transcription of six mar / soxRS regulon promoters in vitro by mechanisms that are strikingly similar to that of MarA and SoxS ( 22 ) .

15150242	ArgP	argK	activator	The model proposed by Celis ( 11 , 12 ) to explain the Can r phenotype of an argP d mutant assumed ( i ) that the mutation represents a loss - of - function ( that is , dominant - negative ) allele of argP and ( ii ) that wild - type @TF$ is a transcriptional activator of @Regulated$ , whose product in turn acts to enhance Arg uptake through two different transport systems .
21441513	ArgP	lysP	regulator	As already mentioned , a potential @TF$ - binding site , ATG AAGGTGTCTTAT , is centered at position 59 in the @Regulated$ promoter / control region ( Fig . 2 ) .
11073923	CRP	rhaBAD	activator	Interestingly , these same three @TF$ mutants had similar small activation defects at the divergent @Regulated$ promoter ( 14 ) .
24593230	ChiX	chiP	repressor	Activation of chbBCA expression by ChbR is essential to relieve @TF$ repression of @Regulated$ .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	@TF$ - dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter in each of the new constructs was measured as above and the results are illustrated in Figure 6B .
17238917	IHF	fimB	activator	Thus , not only does @TF$ stimulate both FimB and FimE recombination , as well as activate fimbrial expression in phase ON cells , but it is now clear that it enhances @Regulated$ expression too .
19007420	GalS	galE	repressor	Indeed , the @TF$ isorepressor was discovered because , in the absence of GalR , there was some residual repression of the @Regulated$ gene .
15150242	ArgP	yggA	regulator	Coeffectors of @TF$ in @Regulated$ regulation .
13129959	Fnr	napF	regulator	DISCUSSION The @Regulated$ operon exhibits a unique pattern of expression and a unique control region architecture in comparison to other characterized E . coli @TF$ - and Nar - regulated operons .
11395452	MarA	gltA	activator	In addition , the PQ - or SoxSresponsive genes gatABD , @Regulated$ , nfnB , and ybjC were recently shown to be activated by constitutive expression of @TF$ ( 5 ) .
11395452	MarA	nfnB	activator	In addition , the PQ - or SoxSresponsive genes gatABD , gltA , @Regulated$ , and ybjC were recently shown to be activated by constitutive expression of @TF$ ( 5 ) .

21441513	ArgP	lysP	regulator	To study the @TF$ - binding site in the @Regulated$ promoter / control region in more detail , DNase I footprinting analysis was performed in the absence and presence of lysine ( Fig . 5 ) .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	In our previous study ( 17 ) , we reported that repression of the @Regulated$ promoter by @TF$ was unaffected by point mutations in either site 1 or site 1 0 .
11395452	SoxS	ybjC	activator	The @Regulated$ gene was also activated by expression of @TF$ in our experiments ( Table 1 ) .
17513476	RhaS	rhaBAD	activator	Given that the activation by full - length , chromosomally expressed @TF$ at @Regulated$ is approximately 33 - fold higher than that of chromosomally expressed RhaR at rhaSR , comparable efficiencies of activation by the CTDs to their full - length counterparts would have resulted in His 6 - RhaR - CTD activating rhaSR by approximately 30 - fold .
15150242	ArgP	yggA	activator	The @TF$ - mediated induction of @Regulated$ expression is also observed upon the addition of the Arg biosynthetic precursor citrulline ( Fig . 3 ) or ornithine ( data not shown ) , most likely by virtue of its conversion to Arg within the cells .
10601201	CRP	fucPIK	activator	This suggests that at the complex @Regulated$ promoter , any interactions between @TF$ and the - CTD do not contribute significantly to promoter activation .
18346968	MelR	melR	repressor	Results illustrated in Figure 6B show that @TF$ - dependent repression of the @Regulated$ promoter in the TB28 fragment is reduced .
7608078	TreR	treC	repressor	The treB @Regulated$ operon is negatively regulated by @TF$ , whose gene treR is located upstream of treB but is not part of the operon .

16478729	MarA	hdeA	repressor	In contrast , in all three known examples of @TF$ - repressed genes ( @Regulated$ , purA , and rob ) , the marbox is in the backward orientation and is proximal to or overlapping the RNAP - binding site ( see Fig . 8 ) .

9696769	NarL	fdnG	activator	The fact that most Fnrdependent promoters have the latter architecture may be due to the fact that many of them are also activated by the @TF$ protein ( e . g . , the narG , @Regulated$ , nrfA , and nirB promoters ) .
19007420	NagC	galP	repressor	Only one @TF$ operator has been identified as important for repression at @Regulated$ .
9696769	NarL	narG	activator	The fact that most Fnrdependent promoters have the latter architecture may be due to the fact that many of them are also activated by the @TF$ protein ( e . g . , the @Regulated$ , fdnG , nrfA , and nirB promoters ) .

9696769	NarP	napF	activator	The @Regulated$ operon provides the only known example of a promoter activated by @TF$ but not NarL .
19245365	Fis	ogt	repressor	Although there is no simple rationale for why the yeaR and @Regulated$ promoters are also repressed by @TF$ , we suggest that rapidly growing cells may opt out of certain stress responses , and we speculate that RNS may be a small risk in these conditions compared with other stresses .

19906180	ArgR	artPIQM	repressor	The @Regulated$ operon is , besides being downregulated by Lrp ( Hung et al . , 2002 ) , also repressed by @TF$ ( Caldara et al . , 2007 ) .

9409145	AraC	araBAD	activator	Model of @TF$ induction by L - arabinose at the @Regulated$ promoter and relevant sites at the divergent araC promoter .
13129959	NarP	napF	activator	One obvious difference between the synthetic promoter and the @Regulated$ operon promoter is that transcription from the latter is also activated by the @TF$ protein bound to a site centered at position 44.5 .
17238917	NanR	fimB	activator	Thus , activation of @Regulated$ expression by @TF$ , as judged by the effect of mutations in nanR , orin its operator sequence ( O NR ) , is enhanced considerably in the D3 deletion mutant .
10850996	Rob	marRAB	activator	Our analysis revealed that inaA , @Regulated$ , aslB , ybaO , mdlA , yfhD , and ybiS were transcriptionally activated by constitutive levels of @TF$ , while galT expression was repressed .

10850996	Rob	marRAB	activator	@TF$ contributes significantly to the expression of the @Regulated$ operon , which regulates the intrinsic resistance of E . coli to various antibiotics , bactericidal agents , and organic solvents ( 5 , 10 , 13 ) .
16621812	AraC	araC	regulator	@TF$ - dependent transcription regulation has been most studied at the araBAD and @Regulated$ genes , which are expressed from divergent promoters , paraBAD and paraC , whose transcription start sites are separated by 166 bp .
17238917	NagC	fimB	activator	By replacing the 274 bp of wild - type DNA from - 467 to - 194 with heterologous sequences it was shown that neither NanR nor @TF$ requires this segment of DNA in order to activate @Regulated$ expression .

10760178	MelR	melAB	activator	Conclusions In this paper , we have reported an in vitro system for the study of transcription activation of the E . coli @Regulated$ promoter by @TF$ .
7601827	NarP	fdnGHI	activator	For example , nitrate induction of the narGHJI operon ( 21 ) and the narK gene ( 12 ) is controlled exclusively by NarL , while induction of the @Regulated$ operon is controlled principally by NarL , but @TF$ also effects a degree of control ( observed with a narL mutant ) ( 21 ) .
9484892	NagC	manXYZ	repressor	The repression of the @Regulated$ operon by a plasmid expressing @TF$ is in agreement with the original observations of Vogler and Lengeler ( 1989 ) .
10850996	Rob	mdlA	activator	Among functions that could contribute to cellular resistance to environmental agents , @TF$ enhances expression of @Regulated$ , which encodes a multiple - drug - resistance - like ATP - binding component of a transport system ( 3 ) , and strongly enhances expression of micF , the antisense RNA that downregulates the outer membrane porin OmpF .

19007420	GalR	galP	repressor	Indeed , the effect of the mutation in OE5 was similar to © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 71 , 146 – 157NagC , @TF$ and GalS repression at @Regulated$ 153 that in the weakly binding OE2 and OE3 sites ( a mutation in OE4 has not yet been tested ) .
19007420	GalS	galP	repressor	Indeed , the effect of the mutation in OE5 was similar to © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 71 , 146 – 157NagC , GalR and @TF$ repression at @Regulated$ 153 that in the weakly binding OE2 and OE3 sites ( a mutation in OE4 has not yet been tested ) .
17238917	NagC	glmUS	activator	@TF$ is best characterized as a repressor ( Plumbridge , 2001 ; Plumbridge and Pellegrini , 2004 ) , although the regulator does activate one of the @Regulated$ operon promoters albeit by binding at the more conventional position of - 47 relative to the transcriptional start site ( Plumbridge , 1995 ) .
17238917	NagC	fimB	activator	At the moment we do not know how @TF$ activates the @Regulated$ promoter , but two general scenarios seem most plausible .
10760178	CRP	melAB	activator	Note that the magnitude of the effect of @TF$ on activation of the @Regulated$ promoter in the in vitro transcription experiment ( Fig . 2B ) is less than might have been expected from the footprinting and in vivo experiments ( Fig . 4 and Table 1 ) .
15743943	CpxR	nanC	activator	Two other regulators , OmpR and @TF$ , activate @Regulated$ expression , although a direct control has not been proven .
15743943	OmpR	nanC	activator	Two other regulators , @TF$ and CpxR , activate @Regulated$ expression , although a direct control has not been proven .
15342598	RhaS	rhaBAD	activator	Previous results reported by Bhende and Egan ( 4 ) identified two amino acid residues in 70 , K593 and R599 , that were important for @TF$ mediated transcription activation at @Regulated$ and rhaT .
17513476	CRP	rhaBAD	activator	Two gels were prepared , with identical culture samples on each gel , and each blot was probed with the primary antibody corresponding to the purified protein samples loaded , as indicated to the right . - S , anti - RhaS antibody ; - R , anti - RhaR antibody . allow @TF$ to contribute to @Regulated$ activation .
15342598	RhaS	rhaT	activator	Previous results reported by Bhende and Egan ( 4 ) identified two amino acid residues in 70 , K593 and R599 , that were important for @TF$ mediated transcription activation at rhaBAD and @Regulated$ .
9409145	AraC	araBAD	activator	It was shown that to activate transcription in P @Regulated$ , the @TF$ protein binding site must overlap the 35 region of the promoter by 4 bp ( 212 ) .
10850996	Rob	marA	regulator	Several @TF$ - regulated genes , such as @Regulated$ , noted above , seem to encode other regulatory proteins .
15342598	RhaR	rhaSR	activator	BACTERIOL . present study , we identified four amino acid residues in 70 , K593 , L595 , R599 , and R608 , which were important for @TF$ mediated transcription activation of @Regulated$ ( Fig . 2B ) .
15066032	CAP	chbB	activator	Although these results are consistent with the requirement for @TF$ and ChbR for @Regulated$ activation there is a significant difference between the in vivo and in vitro data .
15066032	ChbR	chbB	activator	Although these results are consistent with the requirement for CAP and @TF$ for @Regulated$ activation there is a significant difference between the in vivo and in vitro data .

7643383	NarP	aeg	activator	This unusual spacing in relation to the RNA polymerase binding site may reflect a distinct mechanism by which Fnr ( and @TF$ ) activates @Regulated$ - 46.5 operon expression .
12923080	NarP	fdnG	repressor	@TF$ thus performs a unique role to fine - tune @Regulated$ operon expression by delaying the ability of NarL to activate when nitrate levels are low .
8655507	GntR	gntKU	repressor	It is interesting to speculate that this is the element responsible for binding @TF$ and repression of @Regulated$ expression .

12618441	GntR	gntKU	repressor	These results suggest that both GntRbinding sequences , R1 and R2 , are responsible for the repression of @Regulated$ expression , although the affinity of @TF$ or GntH for R1 seems to be different from that for R2 .
15066032	NagC	chbB	repressor	@TF$ is required for full repression of the @Regulated$ operon and it serves to limit induction when the supply of chitobiose is low .
