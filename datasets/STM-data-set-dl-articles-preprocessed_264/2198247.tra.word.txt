172 , No. 8 Regulation of NAD Metabolism in Salmonella typhimurium : Molecular Sequence Analysis of the Bifunctional nadR Regulator and the nadA - pnuC Operon JOHN W. FOSTER , ' * YONG K. PARK ,2 THOMAS PENFOUND , l TERRY FENGER ,3 AND MICHAEL P. SPECTOR4 Department of Microbiology and Immunology , College of Medicine , ' and Department of Biomedical Sciences ,4 University of South Alabama , Mobile , Alabama 36688 ; Department of Biology , Han Nam University , Daejon , South Korea2 ; and Department of Microbiology , Marshall University School of Medicine , Huntington , West Virginia 257553 In Salmonella typhimurium , de novo synthesis of NAD is regulated through the transcriptional control of the nadA and nadB loci .
Likewise , the pyridine nucleotide salvage pathway is controlled at pncB .
The transcriptional expression of these three loci is coordinately regulated by the product of nadR .
However , there is genetic evidence suggesting that NadR is bifunctional , serving in both regulatory and transport capacities .
One class of mutations in the nadR locus imparts a transport - defective PnuA - phenotype .
These mutants retain regulation properties but are unable to transport nicotinamide mononucleotide ( NMN ) intact across the cell membrane .
Other nadR mutants lose both regulatory and transport capabilities , while a third class loses only regulatory ability .
The unusual NMN transport activity requires both the PnuC and NadR proteins , with the pnuC locus residing in an operon with nadA .
To prove that nadlR encoded a single protein and to gain insight into a regulatory target locus , the nadR and nadA pnuC loci were cloned and sequenced .
A DNA fragment which complemented both regulatory and transport mutations was found to contain a single open reading frame capable of encoding a 409 - amino - acid protein ( 47,022 daltons ) , indicating that NadR is indeed bifunctional .
Confirmation of the operon arrangement for nadA and pnuC was obtained through the sequence analysis of a 2.4 - kilobase DNA fragment which complemented both NadA and PnuC mutant phenotypes .
The nadA product , confirmed in maxicells , was a 365 - amino - acid protein ( 40,759 daltons ) , while pnuC encoded a 322 - amino - acid protein ( 36,930 daltons ) .
The extremely hydrophobic ( 71 % ) nature of the PnuC protein indicated that it was an integral membrane protein , consistent with its central role in the transport of NMN across the cytoplasmic membrane .
The results presented here and in previous studies suggest a hypothetical model in which NadR interacts with PnuC at low internal NAD levels , permitting transport of NMN intact into the cell .
As NAD levels increase within the cell , the affinity of NadR for the operator regions of nadA , nadB , and pncB increases , repressing the transcription of these target genes .
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD ) is of central importance to cellular metabolism .
It functions as a cofactor in over 300 oxidation reduction reactions and as a substrate in several others ( e.g. , DNA ligase ) .
Consequently , the maintenance of an optimal intracellular concentration of this nucleotide is of paramount importance .
The cell may synthesize NAD de novo or from preformed pyridine compounds , such as nicotinic acid scavenged from the environment ( 5 ) .
The initial steps of the de novo biosynthetic pathway , L - aspartate oxidase and quinolinic acid synthetase , and one of the components of the scavenging system , nicotinic acid ( NA ) phosphoribosyltransferase ( pncB ) , are transcriptionally regulated in Salmonella typhimurium as determined by lacZ operon fusion studies .
Genes encoding quinolinic acid synthetase ( nadA ) and L - aspartate oxidase ( nadB ) are tnore tightly controlled than the pncB locus ( 4 , 8 , 9 , 17 , 18 ) .
However , all three loci are under negative transcriptional control by the product of the nadR regulatory locus ( 4 , 8 ) .
The nadR locus is located at 99 min on the Salmonella linkage map .
Studies by other investigators refer to this regulator as nadI ( 28 ) .
A highly unusual feature of the pyridine nucleotide - scavenging system in this organism is its ability to transport the phosphorylated pyridine compound nicotinamide mononucleotide ( NMN ) intact across the cytoplasmic membrane * 4187 ( 12 ) .
At least two genetic loci have been implicated in this unique process of pyridine nucleotide uptake , pnuA and pnuC ( 23 ) .
Mutations in either locus were found to severely reduce NMN uptake ( 23 ) .
The pnuC product is an essential component of this transport process , while the role of PnuA can be supplanted by a mutation in pnuB .
The pnuC locus maps at 17 min in an operon with nadA , while mutations giving rise to the PnuA - phenotype map at 99 min , near or in the nadR locus ( 4 , 8 , 28 , 29 ) .
The fact that point mutations in the nadR region gave rise to three clearly discernible phenotypes affecting transcriptional regulation , NMN transport , or both ( NadR + PnuA - , NadR - PnuA + , and NadR - PnuA - , respectively ) provided the first indication that nadR might actually encode a bifunctional protein ( 4 , 28 ) .
In addition , nadRs superrepressor mutations were identified that also conferred a partial PnuA - phenotype to the mutant cell ( 4 ) .
The major question we wished to address was whether nadR did indeed code for a single protein .
Definitive proof that nadR encodes a bifunctional transport - transcriptional regulatory protein demanded DNA sequence analysis of the cloned nadR gene .
Additionally , the DNA sequences of a transcriptional target of NadR such as nadA and the cotransport locus pnuC were desirable for initiating studies of NadR interactions with DNA target sequences ( regulation ) and PnuC ( transport ) .
The results of the DNA sequencing analysis confirm that nadR codes for a bifunctional protein and provide evidence 4188 FOSTER ET AL. that PnuC is an integral membrane protein .
Based upon these and earlier results , a model for the bifunctional character of NadR is proposed .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains , plasmids , bacteriophages , and cultural conditions used .
The bacterial strains used in this study were derivatives of LT2 with the exception of the Escherichia coli maxicell strain CRS603 ( 19 ) .
JF1057 is AnadA101 ApncAJ AnadR4 recAl Asrl galE hutR49 .
JF1535 is zvnadA ApncA A ( nadR - serB ) nadB : : Mu dJ recA srl : : TnJO galE hutR .
The plasmids used were pBR322 , pTZ18R , and pTZ19R ( Pharmacia ) .
The bacteriophages M13mpl8 and M13mpl9 were used for some of the sequencing studies .
Cultural conditions were as described previously ( 8 ) .
Detection of the NadR - and PnuA - phenotypes .
The NadR - regulatory phenotype was visualized as deregulated expression of a nadB - lacZ operon fusion on minimal - medium containing X - gal ( 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - 3-D - galactopyranoside ) ( 40 p.g / ml ) and either 10 - 4 or 10 - 6 M nicotinate for repressive and derepressive conditions , respectively .
The PnuA - transport - defective phenotype was observed as the inability of a nadB pncA nadR mutant to grow on 10 - 4 M NMN .
Use of JF1535 ( nadB - lac ApncA AnadR ) allowed us to monitor both the NadR - and PnuA - phenotypes of plasmids bearing a mutagenized nadR locus .
Manipulation of DNA and DNA sequencing .
Conventional recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described by Maniatis et al. ( 14 ) .
DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxynucleotide method described by Sanger et al. ( 21 ) .
Deletion fragments for DNA sequencing were produced by the single - stranded sequential method of Dale et al. ( 1 ) or the double - stranded sequential method of Henikoff ( 7 ) .
Customized primers were synthesized in the Biopolymer Center at the University of South Alabama .
Routine sequence data manipulations and analyses of DNA and protein sequences were performed with the Pustell sequence analysis system of International Biotechnologies , Inc. , New Haven , Conn. .
Identification of plasmid - encoded proteins was accomplished by the maxicell method essentially as described by Sancar et al. ( 19 ) with modifications outlined by Foster and Aliabadi ( 3 ) .
Alternatively , insertspecific gene products from plasmids containing a T7 promoter ( e.g. , pTZ19R ) were identified by a modification of the Tabor and Richardson T7 RNA polymerase procedure ( 26 ) .
Cells containing a plasmid with a T7 promoter were transformed with pGP1 - 2 .
The pGP1 - 2 plasmid contains the rifampin - resistant T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of temperature - sensitive cI repressor .
However , even without temperature induction , a sufficient amount of T7 RNA polymerase is made to transcribe the T7 promoter plasmid .
The labeling procedure was as follows .
An overnight culture grown in selective minimal - medium was used to inoculate minimal glucose medium supplemented with 10 - 4 M NA and the appropriate antibiotics for plasmid maintenance ( 5 x 106 cells/ml ) .
Each 5 - ml culture was then grown to an OD60 of 0.2 , centrifuged , and suspended in 6 ml of M9 labeling medium .
The culture was allowed to incubate until it reached an ODwo of 0.35 , at which time the culture was split .
Rifampin was added to half of the portions at a final concentration of 240 , ug/ml .
Thirty minutes after the addition of rifampin , the cells were pulse labeled for 5 min with 10 , uCi of [ 35S ] methionine per ml .
Cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed with an equal volume of ice - cold E buffer ( 8 ) , and then stored at -70 Â°C .
Crude membranes were prepared by suspending labeled cells in 300 , u1 of sonication buffer ( 100 mM Tris hydrochloride , 50 mM MgCl2 , pH 7.4 ) .
The suspension was sonicated four times ( 5 - s pulses ) at the lowest power ( Branson Sonifier model 185 ) .
Cell debris was removed by low - speed centrifugation ( 10,000 rpm for 5 min ) , and 150 p. 1 of the supernatant solution was centrifuged at 300,000 x g for 30 min in a Beckman TL - 100 ultracentrifuge .
The crude membrane pellet was suspended in and washed with an equal volume of buffer and recentrifuged .
The pellet was finally suspended in 60 , ul of sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) lysis buffer for SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) analysis .
DNA sequence analysis of nadR and proof of the bifunctional nature of its product .
A 2.5 - kilobase ( kb ) EcoRl - Bglll fragment containing the nadR locus was removed from pFW29 - 4 ( 4 ) and subcloned into the phagemid vectors pTZ18 and pTZ19 .
The resultant plasmids , pFW42 and pFW38 , respectively , contained the fragment in opposite orientations .
Both plasmids complemented NadR - and PnuAphenotypes , indicating that the 2.5 - kb fragment contained the nadR promoter region .
Figure 1A illustrates the sequencing strategy used .
A series of sequential deletions made with the exonuclease III - S1 nuclease procedure as described by Dale et al. ( 1 ) were constructed from both pFW38 and pFW42 .
Single - stranded templates were prepared from each and sequenced with modified T7 DNA polymerase by using the universal reverse primer .
Synthetic oligonucleotide primers prepared from previously determined sequences were used to extend the sequence in some areas .
The DNA and subsequently deduced amino - acid sequences revealed two major open reading frames ( ORFs ) ( Fig. 2 ) .
The first was a 584 - base - pair ( bp ) ORF which would code for a 20,943 - dalton ( Da ) protein .
The second ORF encompassed 1,230 bp , potentially coding for a 47,022 - Da protein ( estimated pl , 5.7 ) .
The maxicell and overexpression studies described below have only shown a 43 - kDa insertspecific protein .
In order to prove whether the smaller ORF affects regulation or transport functions , the sequence encoding this ORF was deleted .
The 20 - kDa ORF contained an HpaI - HinclI site in the middle of its sequence ( Fig. 2 ) .
Deletion of the amino - terminal half of this ORF was achieved via HincIl digestion and relegation of pFW38 , yielding pFW38 - 46 .
This plasmid was introduced into JF1535 ( nadB - lac ApncA AnadR ) to test for complementation of NadR - and PnuAmutant phenotypes .
The results ( Table 1 ) revealed that the plasmid lacking the smaller ORF sequence was still able to complement both the regulatory - and transport - deficient phenotypes of the chromosomal nadR deletion .
Identical results were obtained when a 1,328 - bp StuI fragment containing only the 47 - kDa NadR ORF was subcloned into pTZ19R .
This plasmid , pFP77 , again complemented both the transport and regulatory phenotypes .
However , a deletion extending into the larger 47 - kDa nadR ORF ( to base 343 ) removed both transport and regulatory complementation capabilities .
Maxicell studies revealed the latter deletion created a fusion between the amino terminus of lacZ and the carboxyl three - fourths of nadR .
Furthermore , a StuI deletion of pFW38 that removed nadR but left the 20 - kDa ORF intact failed to complement either phenotype .
These data prove that both the transcriptional regulator and nucleotide transport functions of the nadR locus can be attributed to a VOL .

single 47 - kDa protein , confirming the unusual bifunctional nature of NadR .
Examination of the DNA sequence upstream from nadR revealed two potential promoter regions located at -123 and -150 bp relative to the GUG translational start codon .
Both promoter regions contained consensus -10 Pribnow box sequences ( TATAAT ) with less than consensus -35 regions ( ATGCGT and AHCTCT ) .
A consensus ribosome - binding site ( AGGAGG ) was located 5 bases upstream from the proposed translation initiating codon .
DNA sequence analysis of the nadA - pnuC operon .
A 3.3 - kb AvaI - Sall fragment from pTF20 ( 25 ) containing nadA and pnuC was subcloned into M13mpl9 in both orientations .
Sequential deletions and synthetic oligonucleotide primers to extend sequence information were used to determine the nucleotide sequence of both strands ( Fig. 1B ) .
The DNA and deduced amino - acid sequences are shown in Fig. 3 .
The sequence confirms earlier reports indicating that the nadA and pnuC genes occur in an operon with transcription initiating upstream from nadA ( 29 ) .
A putative promoter was found that included a -10 region ( TATAAA ) at -76 bp and a -35 recognition sequence ( TAIITGAAT ) at -100 bp upstream from the nadA initiating AUG start codon .
The nadA coding region is 1,095 bp , encoding a 40,759 - Da protein ( estimated pI , 8.1 ) .
This correlated to an insertspecific protein identified during maxicell analysis ( see below ) .
A potential ribosome - binding site ( AACiAGiA ) with 71 % identity to the consensus ( AAGGAGG ) occurred seven bases upstream from the initiating AUG. .
Previous studies in this laboratory indicated that nadA expression was partially controlled by cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) ( 8 ) .
DNA sequence analysis confirmed this by locating a potential cyclic AMP response protein - binding site immediately upstream from the -35 recognition site at -115 bp .
The sequence TATTGTGACTTTCCTTA matches the consensus sequence AANTGTGANNTN4CA at 15 of 17 positions , where N indicates any nucleotide .
A putative nadR - binding site was discovered following 4190 FOSTER ET AL. .

comparisons between the nadA and pncB promoter sequences ( C. Grubmeyer , personal communication ) .
The sequence ( TTG lAN5TAAAACAA ) is an inverted repeat located between -91 and -72 bp of the nadA sequence ( numbering based on autotranslation in Fig. 3 ) .
Stem - loop formation would effectively sequester the -10 Pribnow box region of the putative nadA promoter .
Similarly , pncB contained the sequence TAAACAAN24TTGlT [ A , once again positioned so that stem - loop formation would prevent RNA polymerase access to a putative -10 region .
Comparison with the E. coli nadB sequence also revealed a homologous sequence ( GTGTTTAN45TAAACAA ) that flanked the promoter region ( 2 ) .
An attractive model for repression is that NadR binds to these inverted repeats , stabilizing the stem - loop structure .
The pnuC gene sequence was 966 bp in length and encoded a 36,930 - Da protein ( estimated pI , 9.4 ) .
A potential ribosome - binding site , TGGGAGA , was located 3 bp from the putative AUG start codon .
The pnuC N - terminal coding region appeared to overlap the nadA C - terminus by 9 amino acids but was read in a different reading frame .
Such an extended overlap is highly unusual for Salmonella and Escherichia spp. .
Coding sequence overlap in these organisms usually consists of only a few bases ( 24 ) .
There are examples , such as gene A and B of phage XX174 , where extensive overlap does occur ( 22 ) .
The significance of the overlap between nadA and pnuC is unknown and will need to be confirmed through N - terminal protein sequence analysis .
It is possible that translation of nadA and pnuC is coupled , although cells containing insertions in nadA are phenotypically PnuC + .
This fact indicates that a second promoter for pnuC exists within nadA , as suggested previously ( 23 , 27 , 29 ) , but does not rule out translational coupling from a larger transcript .
Two potential promoters for pnuC were identified within the nadA open reading frame .
The first potential promoter had -10 ( IAAAAA ) and -35 ( GTI IAAAA ) regions at 643 and 620 bp of nadA .
The -10 and -35 regions for the second promoter were located at 993 ( CATTAC ) and 968 ( GGIJ.ATC ) bp , respectively .
It is not known which of these promoters plays a role in - vivo .
Analysis of the nadA , pnuC , and nadR products .
Plasmid pFW38 encoding nadR plus the 20 - kDa ORF was introduced into E. coli CRS603 for maxicell analysis .
Only one insertspecific protein was observed ( data not shown ) .
The protein had a molecular mass of 43 kDa in the SDS - PAGE system , which is somewhat smaller than the molecular mass predicted from the DNA sequence .
The pFW38 and pFW38 - 46 plasmids also contained a T7 promoter capable of driving the transcription of both the 20 - kDa ORF and nadR .
We introduced the T7 RNA polymerase - containing plasmid pGP1 - 2 , described by Tabor and Richardson ( 26 ) , into JF1057 ( pFW38 ) and JF1057 ( pFW38 - 46 ) .
The resultant strains , JF1057 ( pFW38 , pGPl - 2 ) and JF1057 ( pFW38 - 46 , pGPl - 2 ) , will transcribe the ORF ( or truncated ORF , in the case of pFW38 - 46 ) and nadR genes even in the presence of rifampin , since the T7 RNA polymerase is resistant to this antibiotic .
Although the T7 RNA polymerase gene is controlled by a temperature - sensitive cI repressor , heat induction was not required to induce its synthesis .
The small amount of constitutively produced T7 RNA polymerase was sufficient to transcribe the pFW38 and pFW38 - 46 inserts .
The results of exclusively expressing the pFW38 - 46 insert are shown in Fig. 4 ( right ) .
Identical results were obtained for pFW38 .
The only insert - specific protein produced in either case was the 43 - kDa NadR .
This indicates that the 20 - kDa ORF is probably a cryptic gene not normally expressed or translated under usual growth - conditions .
Since the NadR protein participates in NMN transport , we examined whether NadR could be found associated with membrane fractions in S. typhimurium by using the T7 RNA polymerase system described above .
The results ( Fig. 4 , right ) indicate that while the majority of NadR was associated with the soluble fraction of sonicated cell extracts , a significant portion ( 20 to 30 % ) was found with membraneenriched fractions ( Fig. 4 , right , lane B ) .
However , most of the NadR protein appearing in the membrane fraction was not membrane associated since only about 10 to 20 % was solubilized by 2 % Triton X - 100 .
The remainder of NadR appeared to form large aggregates that cosedimented with membranes .
No major processing of NadR was observed .
These results , along with the hydrophobicity profile noted below , suggest that even though NadR participates in NMN transport , it probably does not fulfill this role as an integral membrane protein .
However , it may still loosely associate with the membrane .
Plasmids pTF15 and pTF20 were introduced into the maxicell CRS603 strain to identify the NadA and PnuC products .
Both plasmids contained nadA and pnuC , but pTF15 contained an additional 2 kb of upstream sequence ( 27 ) .
Previous work with a chloramphenicol release method in conjunction with two - dimensional PAGE identified NadA and PnuC as 43 - and 25 - kDa proteins , respectively ( 27 ) .
The two - dimensional PAGE procedure , however , made accurate molecular mass determinations difficult , which led us to pursue the maxicell determinations with one - dimensional SDS - PAGE .
Results from the one - dimensional SDS - PAGE experiments indicated that NadA was a 41 - kDa protein ( Fig. 4 , left ) .
This size agrees nicely with the size predicted from the DNA sequence determination .
The apparent molecular mass of PnuC , however , was about 33 kDa , about 4 kDa smaller than predicted from the DNA sequence determinations .
This discrepancy may be due to the extremely hydrophobic nature of this protein .
An additional insert - specific protein with a molecular mass of 32.6 kDa was evident in extracts from pTF15 - containing maxicells .
This protein was missing from pTF20 extracts .
Consequently , an additional gene existed upstream from nadA .
The gene is most likely the envD locus , as determined from the current Salmonella linkage map ( 20 ) .
Structural analyses of NadR , NadA , and PnuC .
The amino acid sequences of the predicted NadR , NadA , and PnuC polypeptides were analyzed to derive molecular models of 4192 FOSTER ET AL. .

The hydropathy plots ( Fig. 5 ) ( 10 , 11 ) indicate that PnuC is an extremely hydrophobic protein ; 71 % of the residues were hydrophobic .
This degree of hydrophobicity is typical of integral membrane transport proteins .
There was the potential for at least seven membrane - spanning regions .
In contrast to PnuC , the second component of this transport system , NadR , did not display a significantly hydrophobic region .
The hydropathy profile for the cytoplasmic NadA protein was interesting because the amino and carboxyl ends were hydrophilic while the middle was rather hydrophobic .
The significance of this is unknown ( 16 , 17 ) .
DISCUSSION Model for the bifunctional nature of the NadR repressortransporter .
The results presented clearly reveal the novel use of one protein ( NadR ) to control two aspects of NAD metabolism .
First , NadR acts as a repressor to regulate the de novo biosynthesis of NAD .
Second , NadR participates with PnuC in some manner to mediate the transport of a precursor ( NMN ) of this cofactor .
Alternative complex scenarios , such as NadR inducing a component of NMN transport separate from PnuC or repressing an antagonist of NMN transport , seem remote possibilities .
The model emerging from these studies is illustrated in Fig. 6 .
In this model , NadR may assume two conformations , one suitable as a transcriptional repressor and one as a component of a transport system .
The presence of high internal levels of NAD is predicted to cause a conformational change from transporter to repressor .
The repressor form of NadR would not be optimal for mediating transport .
This aspect of the model is indicated by the fact that nadRs superrepressor mutants grow poorly on NMN .
This is not due to superrepression of the nadA pnuC operon causing lowered production of PnuC , since mutants carrying insertions and deletions in nadA remain PnuC + due to the presence of an internal unregulated promoter for pnuC ( 27 , 29 ) .
The model also suggests that NadR interacts with PnuC at the membrane to function in the transport of NMN .
The hydropathy plot of the predicted NadR amino - acid sequence does not favor an integral membrane location for this protein ( Fig. 5C ) .
The gene product experiments do suggest that membrane fractions contain a portion of the NadR protein , although the specificity of that association awaits further study .
It seems reasonable to predict that NadR may loosely associate with the membrane through its interaction with the membranebound PnuC .
We hypothesize that NadR may associate or disassociate from the membrane ( at PnuC ?
) depending upon intracellular NAD levels .
In combination with corepressor , the cytoplasmic form of NadR would be capable of acting as a transcriptional repressor of nadA , nadB , and pncB .
While a logical candidate for the corepressor is NAD , this has not been demonstrated .
It is interesting that the consensus sequence ( Gly - X-Gly - X-X - Gly ) for dinucleotide - binding proteins , as proposed by Moller and Amons ( 16 ) , is not present in the NadR sequence .
However , homology to the consensus sequence observed for mononucleotide - binding proteins ( Gly - X-X - X-X - Gly - Lys - Ser ) is present twice in NadR , at A 25 20 NadA 15 2 10 0 -5 -10 2I .

Hypothesized model for the bifunctional nature of NadR .
( A ) Under low internal NAD conditions ( low [ NAD ] , ) , NadR collaborates with PnuC in the transport of NMN .
( B ) Under a high internal NAD concentration ( high [ NAD ] i ) , NadR assumes a conformation i that increases its affinity for nad operator sequences but is less suitable for transport .
positions 66 to 71 ( Gly - X-X - X-Gly - Lys ) and 237 to 244 ( Gly - X-X - X-X - Gly - Lys - Ser ) .
The first site occurs in the amino - terminal half of NadR , while the second site occurs in the carboxyl - terminal half of the 409 - amino - acid protein .
No such site is found in the other protein required for NMN uptake , PnuC .
It will be useful to discover whether mutants deficient in regulation but not transport possess mutations in one of these sites , while mutants with the converse phenotype , transport deficient but regulation proficient , possess mutations in the other site .
While it is tempting to predict nucleotide binding as the corepressor , it is also possible that some form of covalent modification of NadR occurs , converting it to an active repressor ( ADP - ribosylation ?
We are currently seeking additional evidence to reveal the details of this novel mechanism of genetic control .

Open circles indicate conservative replacement of an amino - acid .
Solid circles indicate nonconservative replacement .
that of S. typhimurium ( Fig. 7 ) reveals striking differences and similarities .
The E. coli nadA sequence is an 840 - bp ORF coding for a 31,555 - Da protein .
In contrast , the S. typhimurium nadA is a 1,095 - bp ORF coding for a 40,759 - Da protein .
Maxicell analysis of the Salmonella nadA product confirmed this size ( Fig. 4 ) .
Flachmann et al. ( 2 ) did not report on maxicell studies with the E. coli nadA .
However , Suzuki et al. ( 25 ) did report a molecular weight of 35,000 for partially purified NadA from E. coli .
Consequently , there does appear to be a significant difference between these organisms in the size of the NadA protein .
Comparison of the amino - acid sequence , however , indicates that the central 262 amino - acids of Salmonella NadA are 91.6 % homologous to the equivalent portion of E. coli NadA .
There are 43 additional amino - acids at the amino terminus and 43 additional amino - acids at the carboxyl terminus of the Salmonella NadA protein .
While there is no report of a pnuC locus in E. coli , the sequence reported by Flachmann et al. ( 2 ) does contain a region homologous to the DNA sequence of Salmonella pnuC .
There are several features of the NAD system which make it attractive for study , not the least of which is the unique bifunctional nature of the NadR repressor - transporter and its possible membrane association .
There are other examples of membrane - associated regulatory proteins , such as ToxR from Vibrio cholerae , PutA from S. typhimurium , and BglS from E. coli ( 6 , 13 , 15 ) .
The PutA protein is , in fact , bifunctional , possessing both proline oxidase and repressor activities ( 6 ) .
More like the NadR system , the BglS protein is proposed to be a negative regulator of the bgl operon as well as a component of the P - glucoside phosphoenolpyruvatedependent phosphotransferase transport system ( 13 ) .
The bgl operon , however , is cryptic and thus not central to the physiology of the cell .
The significance of the NadR system lies in the central importance of NAD to cellular physiology and in the unusual transport of a phosphorylated compound , NMN , across the cytoplasmic membrane .
It is reasonable for the cell to utilize such a system to maintain the appropriate intracellular concentration ( ca. 1 mM ) of a major cellular nucleotide .
NAD affects so many diverse biochemical systems that the ability of the cell to respond quickly to NAD deprivation is clearly advantageous .
One protein mediating both transcriptional control and transport of a preformed pyridine nucleotide would make the transition from repression and no transport to derepression and transport extremely efficient .
Questions related to the possible mechanism ( s ) underlying the dual activities of NadR are currently under investigation .
