176 , No. 3 0021 - 9193/94 / $ 04.00 +0 NOTES The spv Virulence Operon of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 Is Regulated Negatively by the Cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - cAMP Receptor Protein System CONOR P. O'BYRNE AND CHARLES J. DORMAN * Molecular Genetics Laboratory , Department of Biochemistry , University of Dundee , Dundee DD1 4HN , Scotland The cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) receptor protein ( CRP ) was found to play a role in the growth phase regulation of the spv operon on the high - molecular - weight virulence plasmid of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 .
By using a lacZ reporter transcriptional - fusion to the spvB structural gene on the single - copy virulence plasmid , it was found that while spvB transcription was induced in stationary - phase cultures , the induced level of expression was lower than that reported for the spv system in other serovars of Salmonella .
Surprisingly , inactivation of the gene encoding the positive activator SpvR resulted in only a threefold reduction in spvB transcription .
In contrast , spvB transcription in stationary - phase cultures was enhanced by 10 - fold in mutants deficient in crp - encoded CRP or cya - encoded adenylate cyclase .
Wild - type ( i.e. , 10 - fold - lower ) levels ofspvB expression were restored by providing active copies of crp or cya on recombinant plasmids .
Enhanced spvB transcription was not seen in crp or cya mutants in the absence of a functional spvR positive regulatory gene , showing that the cAMP - CRP system acted on spvB expression either in conjunction with or via SpvR .
A lacZ transcriptional fusion to spvR could not be induced in stationary - phase cultures in the absence of functional SpvR , regardless of the cAMP - CRP status of the cells .
When SpvR was provided in trans , transcription of the spvR - lacZ fusion was induced to similar levels in stationary - phase cultures with and without cAMP - CRP .
These data are consistent with spvR being poorly transcribed from the single - copy virulence plasmid in S. typhimurium LT2 and with a suppression of this defect via inactivation of the cAMP - CRP system .
The physiological significance of cAMP - CRP involvement in spv expression is discussed .
In common with several other serovars of Salmonella , Salmonella typhimurium requires a high - molecular - weight virulence plasmid in order to cause systemic disease in laboratory mice following oral inoculation ( reviewed in reference 13 ) .
The plasmid enhances the growth - rate of S. typhimurium in mice ( 14 ) .
Genetic and molecular genetic analyses of the plasmids have defined one region as being particularly significant in terms of Salmonella virulence in mice .
This segment is known as the Salmonella plasmid virulence ( spv ) region and is an operon consisting of at least four structural genes , spvABCD , and a gene encoding a positive transcriptional regulator , spvR .
The nucleotide sequences of these genes are known , but detailed information about their functions is lacking in several cases .
The best understood is spvR , which codes for a DNA binding protein with an N - terminal domain showing amino acid sequence homology to the DNA binding domains of members of the LysR family of transcriptional regulators ( 6 , 13 , 19 , 29 ) .
SpvR regulates its own gene positively and is also required to activate transcription of the spvABCD operon ( 6 , 9 , 13 , 34 ) .
The functions of the structural gene products remain obscure , although SpvB shows homology to a human plasma membrane calcium pump protein , a calcium - transport - * Department of Biochemistry , University of Dundee , Dundee DD1 4HN , Scotland , United Kingdom .
ing ATPase from rat brain , and the accessory enterotoxin from Vibrio cholerae ( 36 ) .
The spv operon is subject to complex regulation at the level of transcription .
Work with the spv system in Salmonella dublin Lane has shown that the structural genes are induced following the transition from the exponential to the stationary - phase of growth and that this induction depends on the SpvR regulatory protein ( 9 , 19 ) .
It also depends on a stationary - phase - specific sigma factor known as RpoS ( 20 , 21 , 24 ) .
By introducing recombinant plasmids carrying the spvB gene into Escherichia coli mutants deficient in RpoS , Norel et al. ( 28 ) showed that this sigma factor is required for expression of this gene in stationary - phase cultures .
Fang et al. ( 10 ) achieved similar results with both E. coli and S. typhimurium rpoS mutants .
Expression of the operon is also modulated in a complex manner by environmental stimuli such as iron limitation and changes in pH , temperature , and glucose levels ( 9 , 33 , 37 ) .
Previous investigations with the S. dublin Lane spv genes on multicopy plasmids appeared to rule out the possibility that the pleiotropic chromosomal regulatory loci ompR , phoP , and cya - crp , which are essential for S. typhimurium virulence in mice ( 7 , 8 , 27 ) , are also essential for growth phase induction of spv virulence gene expression ( 9 ) .
However , the possibility that cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) - cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) regulates spv transcription negatively had not been investigated previously .
Furthermore , the finding that glucose addition can repress spv expression during exponential - growth ( 37 ) 905 906 NOTES J. BACTERIOL .

Construction of lacZ reporter fusions to spvR and spvB on the single - copy virulence plasmid .
The lacZ gene from E. coli was used to generate transcriptional - fusions to spvR and spvB .
First , a 4.1 - kb EcoRI fragment of virulence plasmid DNA carrying spvB was cloned into pBR328 , generating plasmid pCOB1 ( Fig. 1 ) .
A culture of S. typhimurium LT2 harboring this plasmid was subjected to mutagenesis with MudJ ( a derivative of bacteriophage Mu which carries a promoterless lacZY operon and a kanamycin resistance gene ) by the transitory cis - complementation method of Hughes and Roth ( 16 ) .
Plasmid DNA was prepared from the mutagenized culture and introduced into LT2 by electroporation ( Bio - Rad Gene Pulser ) ( 15 ) , with selection for kanamycin resistance ( Kanr ) ( 50 , ug ml - 1 ) .
Plasmids capable of conferring a Kan ' phenotype harbored MudJ insertions .
These plasmids were screened by restriction enzyme analysis ( 31 ) for derivatives with MudJ insertions within spvB .
One such plasmid , pCOB5 , was retained for further analysis ( Fig. 1 ) .
The location and orientation of the MudJ insertion within the spvB gene were confirmed by DNA sequencing ( data not shown ) .
In order to study the spvB - lacZ fusion within the native context of the high - molecular - weight virulence plasmid , the MudJ - mutagenized gene was returned to its native location by homologous recombination .
Since pBR328 derivative pCOB5 possesses a ColEl replicon , it can not replicate in a polA mutant background ( 18 ) .
This plasmid was introduced into S. typhimurium poLA strain CH607 by electroporation , and Kanr transformants were selected .
Colonies which had a Kanr phenotype but which had lost vector - encoded resistance to ampicillin ( Ampr ) ( 50 , ug ml - ' ) were deemed likely to have undergone the desired double recombination event .
The Kanr marker was then rescued by transduction with phage P22 ( HT 105/1 int - 201 ) ( 23 ) into a clean LT2 background .
One strain carrying such a recombinant plasmid , CJD671 , was retairied for further analysis ( Table 1 ) .
The position and orientation of the MudJ insertion within the spvB gene on the single - copy virulence plasmid were confirmed by Southern blotting and hybridization with an spvB DNA probe ( data not shown ) .
The regulatory gene spvR was cloned from the virulence plasmid on a 2.3 - kb EcoRI - SalI fragment in pBR328 , generating plasmid pCOB3 ( Fig. 1 ) .
This plasmid was mutagenized with MudJ as described above for pCOB1 , and a derivative ( pCOB10 ) harboring a MudJ insertion in spvR was isolated .
The location and orientation of MudJ within spvR in pCOB10 were determined by Southern analysis and DNA sequencing ( data not shown ) .
The spvR - lacZ fusion was then transferred to the large virulence plasmid in LT2 by a double recombination event in a pol4 strain as described above for the spvB - lacZ fusion .
The strain harboring the resulting single - copy spvRlacZ fusion was designated CJD661 ( Table 1 ) .
In order to study spvB - lacZ expression from the large virulence plasmid in the absence of active spvR , it was necessary to inactivate the regulatory gene .
First , the cloned copy of spvR in multicopy plasmid pCOB3 was inactivated by inserting a 3.5 - kb PstI fragment ( from which the 3 ' overhangs had been removed ) ( 31 ) carrying the cat gene from plasmid pKT205 ( 2 ) into the unique HpaI site within spvR .
The resulting plasmid was designated pCOB14 ( Fig. 1 ) .
The inactivated spvR : : cat gene was introduced in cis with the spvB - lacZ fusion on the high - molecular - weight virulence plasmid in strain CJD671 by using thepolA - based approach described above , which allowed the desired double recombinants to be selected .
NOTES 907 The strain harboring spvR : : cat and spvB - lacZ in cis was designated CJD682 .
The structure of the mutated spv operon was confirmed by Southern analysis ( data not shown ) .
Loss of SpvR activity was demonstrated by introducing pCOB3 and pCOB14 separately into strain CJD671 and measuring expression of the spvB - lacZ fusion by P - galactosidase assay .
While the strain carrying pCOB3 underwent a 20 - fold enhancement of spvBlacZ expression in stationary - phase , that carrying pCOB14 showed no enhanced expression ( data not shown ) .
This confirmed that insertion of the cat gene into spvR eliminated the ability of pCOB3 to activate spvB transcription in trans .
spv expression is enhanced in the absence of cAMP - CRP .
To study spv expression in the absence of CRP or adenylate cyclase , phage P22 lysates on strains CH1107 and CH1108 ( Table 1 ) were used to construct cya : : TnlO and crp : : TnlO derivatives of CJD671 , respectively .
These mutants were designated CJD672 ( harboring the crp : : TnlO lesion ) and CJD674 ( harboring the cya : : TnlO lesion ) ( Table 1 ) .
P - Galactosidase activity specified by the spvB - lacZ fusion on the single - copy virulence plasmid in CJD671 was monitored during - growth to stationary - phase in nutrient broth supplemented with kanamycin .
Expression of the fusion was found to increase by 15 - fold when the culture entered stationary - phase ( Fig. 2 ) .
This was the first time that expression of an spvB - lacZ transcriptional - fusion from the native virulence plasmid of S. typhimurium had been measured , and the expression pattern was qualitatively consistent with those obtained by others working with multicopy plasmids and with mRNA expressed from the single - copy plasmid ( 9 , 19 ) .
However , the level of spvB - lacZ expression was low compared with data from other groups ( 9 , 19 ) ( see below ) .
When spvB expression was measured in cultures of the crp 908 NOTES So 300 100 o 4 - 0.0 0.5 1.0 I. 5 2.0 0 30200 OD 600 nm 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 OD 600 FIG. 2 .

For cAMP - CRP + cultures , the transition from exponential to stationary - phase of growth occurred at an optical density at 600 nm ( OD6 .0 ) of approximately 1.2 .
For cAMP - or CRP - cultures , it occurred at an OD6 .0 of approximately 1.0 ( data not shown ) .

mutant CJD672 or the cya mutant CJD674 grown in nutrient broth supplemented with kanamycin ( 50 , ug ml - ' 1 ) and tetracycline ( 10 , ug ml - ' 1 ) , the induced level detected in stationary phase was 10 - fold higher than that seen in the wild - type ( CJD671 ) cells ( Fig. 2 ) .
These data indicated that spvB transcription was regulated negatively by the products of the crp and cya ' genes .
However , the crp and cya lesions did not lead to generalized derepression of spvB - lacZ transcription throughout growth ; enhanced expression was seen primarily in stationary phase .
Furthermore , the enhanced levels of spvB - lacZ expression were almost identical in the two mutants , which is consistent with this effect being due to the loss of the cAMP - CRP complex rather than being a nonspecific effect arising from these mutations .
When a trp : : TnlO mutation was introduced into CJD671 by P22 transduction , no effect on spvB - lacZ expression was detected ( data not shown ) .
This showed that the effect was specific to the crp and cya mutations and that a TnlO insertion elsewhere on the chromosome could not achieve the same effect .
To address the possibility that the enhancement in spvB - lacZ transcription seen in mutants deficient in the cAMP - CRP system is be confined to cultures grown in nutrient broth , the experiments were repeated with cultures grown in a different complex medium ( LB ) ( 25 ) and in a minimal - medium ( M9 ) ( 25 ) .
Similar results were obtained with cultures grown in LB ( data not shown ) and with those grown in M9 ( see below ) , showing that the enhancement was not a feature of nutrient broth cultures alone .
To confirm the specificity of the effects of the crp and cya mutations on spvB expression , recombinant plasmids bearing functional copies of these genes were introduced into the mutants .
Plasmid pHA7 harbors an active copy of the E. coli crp gene in plasmid pBR322 , while plasmid pDIA100 harbors an active copy of the E. coli cya gene cloned in pBR322 ( Table 1 ) .
Plasmids pHA7 and pDIA100 were introduced into strains CJD672 and CJD674 , respectively , generating strains CJD673 and CJD675 ( Table 1 ) .
These strains were then tested for complementation of the crp and cya lesions .
In each case , the mutations were complemented fully , restoring spvB expression to the low level seen in the wild - type strain CJD671 ( Fig. 2 ) .
The cloning vectors alone failed to complement the crp and cya mutations ( data not shown ) .
The complementation data also showed that the presence of additional copies of crp or cya did not result in reduced spvB expression compared with that detected in CJD671 .
Thus , the negative influence of cAMP - CRP due to the single - copy crp and cya genes in CJD671 was maximal for the spvB gene .
Enhanced spvB expression in cya or crp mutants requires SpvR .
It was important to determine whether the enhanced expression of spvB seen in stationary - phase crp or cya mutants was dependent on the positive activator gene spvR .
Strain X3344 is a derivative of LT2 which has been cured of the large virulence plasmid ( Table 1 ) .
The pBR328 derivative pCOB5 ( AspvR spvB : : MudJ ) was introduced into X3344 , generating strain CJD676 ( Table 1 ) .
Plasmid pCOB5 was also introduced into crp : : TnlO and cya : : TnlO derivatives of X3344 , generating CJD677 and CJD678 , respectively ( Table 1 ) .
Stationary - phase cultures of these multicopy spvB - lacZ fusion strains were assayed for , - galactosidase activity .
In the absence of spvR , no enhancement of spvB expression was detected in the crp or cya mutants ( data not shown ) .
These data indicated that the enhancement of spvB expression seen in mutants deficient in crp or cya required the positive regulator SpvR .
It was decided also to examine the expression of spvB from the large virulence plasmid in the absence of active SpvR in strains deficient in the cAMP - CRP complex .
An spvR : : cat insertion mutation was introduced into the large virulence plasmid of the crp : : TnlO spvB - lacZ strain CJD672 by allelic replacement , generating CJD683 ( Table 1 ) .
Expression of the spvB - lacZ fusion was monitored throughout the growth cycle in strains CJD671 , CJD672 , and CJD683 ( Fig. 3A ) .
The results showed that in the absence of functional spvR , enhanced spvB expression was not detectable in the crp mutant .
This confirmed the requirement for the SpvR positive regulator for enhanced expression of spvB in the absence of the cAMP - CRP complex .
However , the stationary - phase values for spvB - lacZ VOL .

expression in CJD671 appeared low when compared with those obtained by other workers using alternative detection methods to measure spvB expression in other Salmonella serovars ( 9 , 19 , 37 ) .
A direct comparison of the levels of stationary - phase spvB - lacZ transcription in strains with and without an active copy of the spvR regulatory gene was carried out by using strains CJD671 ( spvR + ) and CJD682 , in which an spvR : : cat insertional mutation had been introduced into the virulence plasmid by allelic replacement ( Table 1 ) .
The results obtained showed that in the presence of functional spvR , spvB - lacZ expression in stationary - phase was only threefold higher than that in the spvR mutant ( Fig. 3B ) .
This could be explained by poor spvR expression or by the expression of a defective SpvR protein in these strains of S. typhimurium LT2 .
The spvR gene of S. typhimurium LT2 encodes a functional protein .
Studies with spvR are complicated by the fact that the gene is autoregulated positively at the level of transcription ( 34 ) .
It was decided to test the ability of the S. typhimurium LT2 spvR gene to activate itself by studying the effect of this gene in trans on an spvR - lacZ - transcriptional - fusion .
Strain CJD661 harbors an spvR - lacZ fusion on the single - copy virulence plasmid ( Table 1 ) .
Plasmid pCOB9 , which harbors a copy of the S. typhimurium LT2 spvR gene , was introduced into CJD661 by electroporation ( producing CJD662 ) ( Table 1 ) .
The provision of trans - acting copies of spvR resulted in strong induction of the spvR - lacZ fusion ( Fig. 4 ) .
This showed that the LT2 spvR gene encoded a functional , trans - acting transcriptional activator .
Furthermore , the positive effect of pCOB9 on spvR - lacZ transcription was seen principally in stationary phase , indicating that , like spvB , it is subject to growth phase regulation .
To test the ability of SpvR to activate spvR transcription in the absence of the cAMP - CRP system , plasmid pCOB9 was introduced into strain CJD684 , which harbors the single - copy spvR - lacZ fusion on the virulence plasmid and a chromosomal crp : : TnlO mutation ( Table 1 ) .
The resulting strain was designated CJD685 .
It was found that the absence of a functional crp gene had no significant effect on the final level of spvR - lacZ transcription detected in stationary - phase ( Fig. 4 ) .
The spvRlacZ fusion did appear to be induced prematurely in the crp mutant ( Fig. 4 ) , but this may have been because this mutant entered stationary - phase at a lower A600 than its parent .
Increased spvR gene dosage enhances S. typhimurium LT2 spvB expression principally in stationary - phase .
Artificially increasing spvR expression by placing the gene on a multicopy plasmid resulted in a high level of spvR transcription , as measured by a lacZ reporter fusion ( see previous section ) .

absence of an active single - copy spvR gene were consistent with a situation in which the spvR gene in LT2 strains of S. typhimurium was expressed poorly , even in stationary - phase .
This hypothesis could be tested by observing the effects of spvR overexpression on the single - copy spvB - lacZ transcriptional fusion .
Plasmid pCOB9 was introduced into strain CJD671 ( spvB - lacZ ) , yielding strain CJD686 ( Table 1 ) .
The principal consequence of the presence of multicopy spvR in the cell was a dramatic increase in the level of spvB expression in stationary phase ( Fig. 5 ) .
The values obtained in cultures of CJD686 in stationary - phase were approximately 50 - fold higher than those seen in cultures of CJD671 .
This finding was consistent with the poor stationary - phase expression of spvB - lacZ in CJD671 being due to a lack of SpvR activator .
Interestingly , overexpression of the spvR gene from a multicopy plasmid did not alter the growth phase - dependent pattern of spvB - lacZ expression .
While increased spvR gene dosage raised the basal level of spvB expression ( Fig .
SB ) , stationary - phase - associated signals were still required for the major induction event .
This points to a bipartite mechanism of spvB induction which depends on SpvR but which also requires a signal provided in stationary - phase .
The effect of carbon source on spvB transcription in wildtype and crp : : TnlO strains .
The data obtained with cya and crp mutations in this study identified adenylate cyclase and CRP as negative regulators of spvB transcription at least in LT2 strains of S. typhimurium .
The usual role of the cAMP - CRP system in transcriptional regulation is that of an activator .
Cataboliterepressible genes are derepressed when cells are grown in glycerol and are repressed in glucose cultures .
This is because glucose uptake decreases cAMP levels in the cell and prevents CRP from binding to DNA ( 5 , 22 , 25 , 26 ) .
To test the possibility that growth in the presence of glucose derepresses spvB - lacZ by removing the negative regulator CRP from DNA , cultures of CJD671 and its crp : : TnlO derivative ( CJD672 ) were grown to stationary - phase in M9 containing 0.4 % glucose or in M9 containing 0.4 % glycerol .
In both media , levels of spvBlacZ expression detected were generally lower than those seen in cultures grown in complex media .
Effect of carbon source on spvB expression .
Cultures of CJD671 ( spvB - lacZ ) and its crp : : TnlO derivative CJD672 were grown to stationary - phase in either M9 containing 0.4 % glycerol ( gly ) or M9 containing 0.4 % glucose ( glu ) and assayed for 3 - galactosidase activity .
Stationary - phase gly - grown cells were then resuspended in fresh M9 containing 0.4 % glycerol ( gly gly ) or M9 containing 0.4 % glucose ( gly glu ) and assayed after a further 60 min of growth .
Similarly , stationaryphase glu - grown cells were resuspended in fresh M9 containing 0.4 % glycerol ( glu gly ) or M9 containing 0.4 % glucose ( glu glu ) and assayed after a further 60 min .
Data shown are the means of four measurements .

was derepressed in the crp : : TnlO mutant but remained low in the parent strain , CJD671 ( Fig. 6 ) .
It could be argued that the wild - type CJD671 cells had exhausted the carbon sources ( i.e. , had become carbon starved ) , triggering an increase in intracellular cAMP levels which could repress spvB - lacZ via the cAMP - CRP system .
To address this criticism , the stationaryphase cells were washed twice in carbon source - free M9 medium and resuspended in fresh M9 medium containing either 0.4 % glycerol or 0.4 % glucose .
After 60 min of growth in these media , cells were once again assayed for spvB - lacZ transcription .
As before , the level of expression in wild - type CJD671 cells remained repressed compared with that seen in CJD672 ( crp : : TnlO ) cells treated in the same manner ( Fig. 6 ) .
This pattern of expression remained unchanged even after a further 2 h of growth in these fresh media ( data not shown ) .
Thus , levels of glucose capable of inhibiting transcription of well - characterized catabolite - repressible systems such as the E. coli lac operon ( 5 ) had no detectable effect on spvB in the presence of a functional cAMP - CRP system .
The data presented here are consistent with a role for the cAMP - CRP complex in the negative regulation of the spv virulence operon in S. typhimurium LT2 .
By using a lacZ - transcriptional - fusion to the S. typhimurium LT2 spvB structural gene in its native context on the single - copy virulence plasmid , it was found that while spvB transcription was enhanced by about 15 - fold on entry into stationary - phase , the final expression level detected appeared to be much lower than that found by other workers studying closely related systems , such as spv in S. dublin Lane ( 9 , 19 ) .
Intriguingly , inactivation of the crp and cya genes which code for the cAMP - CRP system resulted in a further 10 - fold enhancement of spvB transcription in stationary - phase LT2 cultures .
These levels of expression seemed closer to those seen by others working with the S. dublin Lane system .
It was formally possible that the LT2 spv VOL .
176 , 1994 system possessed a defect in SpvR expression and that inactivation of the cAMP - CRP system suppressed this defect .
At what level is spv regulation by spvR defective in LT2 ?
Certainly , the LT2 spvR gene is capable of encoding an active SpvR protein .
When this protein is expressed from a multicopy plasmid , it activates in trans transcription both of a single - copy spvR - lacZ fusion ( positive autoregulation ) and of the independently transcribed single - copy spvB structural gene .
Its ability to activate its own transcription or that of spvB when present in multicopy and in trans also suggests that the spvR and spvB genes on the single - copy virulence plasmid in LT2 possess the normal regulatory signals ( such as binding sites for SpvR ) .
The finding that the cAMP - CRP effect on spvB transcription requires functional spvR implies that the spvR promoter on the virulence plasmid is proficient for transcription , at least in the absence of cAMP - CRP .
Perhaps LT2 is deficient in a stationary - phase - specific signalling system .
This is unlikely , since the spv operon shows stationary - phase induction when spvR is overexpressed from a multicopy plasmid .
The most likely defect is one of SpvR expression from the single - copy plasmid as the culture enters stationary - phase .
At present , the nature of this defect is unknown .
The finding that spv transcription in stationary - phase cultures of LT2 can be elevated by inactivation of the cAMP - CRP system is intriguing , particularly as the induced level in cya or crp mutants is qualitatively similar to that seen by others working with spv in other systems .
This is especially true of the data of Fang et al. ( 9 ) and Krause et al. ( 19 ) , who measured expression of spv mRNA from the single - copy plasmid in S. dublin Lane .
Their stationary - phase expression values for spvB seem more like that seen in the LT2 cya or crp mutants than that in LT2 itself .
A possible explanation for the difference between the results obtained with S. typhimurium LT2 and S. dublin Lane is that other workers are studying the spv system in a cAMP - CRP - deficient background .
This seems unlikely but remains to be tested .
At what level does cAMP - CRP influence spv transcription ?
Thus far , rpoS ( 10 , 28 ) and cya - crp ( this work ) are the only known chromosomal regulators of spv expression .
Their effects are functionally opposed in that RpoS is required for spv operon activation in stationary - phase whereas cAMP - CRP seems to repress transcription .
Transcriptional repression is an unusual role for cAMP - CRP ; the complex normally functions as a positive regulator of transcription ( 5 ) .
However , there are examples of negative regulation by cAMP - CRP , notably in the cases of the crp and cya genes themselves ( 17 ) .
cAMP - CRP represses the cya promoter directly by inhibiting the action of RNA polymerase at the promoter ; it represses crp expression indirectly by activating transcription of an antisense RNA which in turn inhibits crp expression .
Thus , the negative action of cAMP - CRP on transcription need not be direct ( see below ) .
This point is particularly relevant in the case of spv regulation , since the molecular detail of the cAMP - CRP repression mechanism is completely unknown .
Significantly , cAMP has been described previously as a regulator of rpoS transcription .
A deletion in the cya gene coding for adenylate cyclase results in a sixfold increase in rpoS transcription in E. coli , suggesting that cAMP is a negative regulator of rpoS ( 20 ) .
However , in a second study , cAMP was found to stimulate E. coli rpoS transcription ( 24 ) .
While the discrepancies between these data remain unresolved , it is clear that cAMP influences transcription of rpoS .
Furthermore , the RpoS - dependent E. coli gene appA ( coding for stationaryphase - specific acid phosphatase ) is negatively regulated by cAMP - CRP ( like spv ) and this occurs both directly and via RpoS ( 20 ) .
It is possible that the negative effect of cAMP - CRP NOTES 911 on spvB transcription occurs via rpoS .
If this is so , our data are consistent with a model in which cAMP acts as a negative regulator of RpoS expression .
At first sight , the action of cAMP - CRP on spv expression appears to be at variance with the effects of glucose on the spv system as reported here and by others .
When glucose levels increase , intracellular cAMP levels fall and genes subject to activation by cAMP - CRP fail to be expressed because the CRP does not bind to DNA in the absence of cAMP ( reviewed in reference 22 ) .
If increasing glucose levels result in a failure of CRP to bind DNA , cAMP - CRP - repressed systems such as spv should be derepressed under conditions of increased glucose .
Conversely , in conditions of glucose - starvation , these systems should be repressed .
In fact , studies with anti - Spv antibodies in S. dublin Lane show that glucose - starvation results in premature expression of the SpvA , SpvB , and SpvC proteins while addition of 0.2 % glucose to the medium represses expression of these proteins until stationary - phase ( 37 ) .
Using an spvBlacZ translational fusion on a multicopy plasmid , Fang et al. ( 9 ) showed that glucose - starvation arrested culture growth and induced SpvB - LacZ expression .
However , the effects of carbon source on spv transcription have not been investigated previously .
In this report , it is shown that levels of spvB transcription in S. typhimurium are similar in cultures grown in the presence of glycerol or glucose and that inactivation of the cAMP - CRP system results in spvB transcriptional derepression in both media .
The level of glucose used ( 0.4 % ) is sufficient to repress classical catabolite - repressible operons such as lac in E. coli ( 5 , 25 ) .
Perhaps it did not remove sufficient cAMP in S. typhimurium to prevent CRP from binding to DNA ( at rpoS ?
) and repressing spvB - lacZ transcription .
This may be because the ( unidentified ) CRP binding site ( s ) involved has a very high affinity for the cAMP - CRP complex .
It is also possible that spv expression is subject to regulation at both the transcriptional and the posttranscriptional levels , with cAMP - CRP operating at the transcriptional level .
This seems to be true for RpoS , which is controlled at both the transcriptional level ( via cAMP - CRP ) and the translational level by carbon - starvation ( 21 , 24 ) .
If spv is subject to such dual control , then the negative effects of cAMP - CRP may operate via RpoS at the level of spv transcription and the stimulatory effects of glucose - starvation reported by others may occur posttranscriptionally .
Further work with these overlapping regulators is required before this complicated gene regulatory system is fully understood .
