86 , pp. 3484 - 3488 , May 1989 Biochemistry OxyR , a positive regulator of hydrogen - peroxide - inducible genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium , is homologous to a family of bacterial regulatory proteins ( oxidative - stress/autoregulation/LysR / NodD ) MICHAEL F. CHRISTMAN * t , GISELA STORZ * , AND BRUCE N. AMES * : * Department of Biochemistry , University of California , Berkeley , CA 94720 Contributed by Bruce N. Ames , December 23 , 1988 ABSTRACT The oxyR gene is required for the induction of a regulon of hydrogen - peroxide - inducible genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium .
The E. coli oxyR gene has been cloned and sequenced , revealing an open reading frame ( 305 amino - acids ) that encodes a 34.4 - kDa protein , which is produced in maxicells carrying the oxyR clone .
The OxyR protein shows homology to a family of positive regulatory proteins including LysR in E. coli and NodD in Rhizobium .
Like them , oxyR appears to be negatively autoregulated : an oxyR : : lacZ gene fusion produced 5 - fold higher levels of 3 - galactosidase activity in oxyR null mutants compared to oxyR + controls , and extracts from an OxyR - overproducing strain were able to protect regions ( -27 to +21 ) of the oxyR promoter from DNase I digestion .
DNA sequence analysis of the oxyR2 mutation , which causes overexpression of oxyR - regulated proteins in the absence of oxidative - stress , showed that the oxyR2 phenotype is due to a missense mutation ( C - G to TEA transition ) that changes alanine to valine at amino - acid position 234 of OxyR .
Cloning and DNA sequence analysis of the genes encoding bacterial and phage transcriptional regulatory proteins has facilitated the understanding of the molecular mechanisms used to control gene expression by directing attention to a few evolutionarily conserved domains in these regulatory proteins ( 1 - 4 ) .
Numerous transcriptional regulatory proteins contain a conserved `` helix - turn - helix '' domain by which many bacterial ( and some eukaryotic ) proteins recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences ( reviewed in refs .
Several bacterial proteins have since been found to be alternative sigma factors for RNA polymerase ( reviewed in ref .
Recently , it has also been noted that for many bacterial regulons , two proteins are involved in regulating gene expression and that these proteins share homology ( reviewed in ref .
In these systems , one protein is thought to function as the sensor of an environmental change and the other component is a transcriptional activator .
Through extensive sequence comparisons , Kofoid and Parkinson ( 4 ) have extended these classes and denoted transmitter and receiver domains in many bacterial regulatory proteins .
We have previously described a regulator , oxyR , of hydrogen peroxide - inducible genes in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli ( 6 ) .
Treatment of bacterial cells with low doses of hydrogen - peroxide induces resistance to subsequent lethal doses of hydrogen - peroxide and the synthesis of 30 proteins .
Nine of these proteins , including catalase , glutathione reductase , and an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase , require the oxyR gene for hydrogen - peroxide induction .
Strains with deletions of oxyR are unable to induce this regulon and are hypersensitive to hydrogen - peroxide .

3484 carrying a dominant mutation , oxyRi in S. typhimurium and oxyR2 in E. coli , are resistant to hydrogen - peroxide killing and constitutively overproduce the oxyR - regulated proteins .
As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of OxyR action , we have sequenced the oxyR ' and oxyR2 genes from E. coli and investigated the regulation of oxyR .
Here we report that OxyR is a member of a family of bacterial regulator proteins .

RESULTS Cloning oxyR from E. colU .
We previously isolated deletions of oxyR in S. typhimurium ( oxyRA2 , TA4108 ) and E. coli ( oxyRA3 , TA4112 ) by selecting for the loss of TnJO insertions in the nearby argH ( 89.5 min ) and OuB genes ( 89.7 min ) ( 6 ) .
Since TnJO - mediated deletions extend in only one direction from the original insertion , oxyR had to be located in the region between argH and btuB as shown in Fig. 1 .
A 15.4 - kb clone ( pBJM003 ) carrying the E. coli btuB gene and a series pBJM003 derivatives carrying TnlOOO ( y - O ) insertions were described by Heller et al. ( 22 ) .
pBJM003 and five insertion derivatives were transformed into the E. coli oxyR deletion strain , and transformants were then tested for sensitivity to hydrogen - peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide .
The hypersensitivity to peroxides exhibited by oxyRA3 is corrected by pBJM003 and all of the TnJOOO derivatives except pBJM003 - TnJOOO - 2 ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , the oxyR gene is located at or near the site of the TnJOOO - 2 insertion , about 800 bp from the BamHI site in pBJM003 .
A 2.3 - kb EcoRI/BamHI fragment of pBJM003 , which carries the site of TnJOOO - 2 insertion , was isolated and cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pUC12 ( pAQ16 ) .
This 2.3 - kb insert complemented the peroxide hypersensitivity of oxyRA3 ( Table 1 ) .
To further define the sequences required for complementation of the chromosomal deletion of oxyR , a 1.0 - kb internal EcoRV fragment was removed from the 2.3 - kb clone to give pAQ17 and pAQ18 .
pAQ17 and pAQ18 were still able to complement the oxyR deletion strain ( Table 1 ) .
The restriction map of pAQ17 is given in Fig. 2A , and the DNA carried by further subclones is indicated .
The ability of the subclones to complement the oxyRA3 sensitivity to hydrogen - peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide is reflected by the zones of inhibition given in Table 1 .
pAQ19 still complements the oxyRA3 sensitivity and even confers slightly greater resistance than any of the larger clones .
pAQ20 and pAQ21 no longer complement oxyRA3 , indicating that essential portions of the oxyR gene have been deleted .
pAQ16 and pAQ17 were also found to restore the inducibility of oxyRregulated proteins by hydrogen - peroxide as determined by two - dimensional protein gels in oxyR deletion strains ( data not shown ) .

OxyR Is a 34 - kDa Protein .
The proteins encoded by the various oxyR subclones were examined by labeling the plasmid - encoded proteins in maxicells .
The vector control ( pUC18 ) and pAQ17 , -18 , -19 , -20 , and -21 were transformed into CSR603 , a recA - , uvrB - strain .
When this strain is irradiated with UV light , most of the chromosomal DNA is damaged , but , because of the large number of plasmids , some of these escape UV damage .
The cells are unable to repair the UV damage and degrade all the damaged DNA .
If [ 35S ] methionine is added several hours later , only proteins encoded by the undamaged plasmid DNA are synthesized and labeled .

The cells carrying pAQ20 encode a protein that is smaller than 34 kDa , possibly a truncated form of the major 34 - kDa species , suggesting that the Mst I end of the clone corresponds to the C - terminal end of the OxyR protein .
pAQ21 does not encode any plasmidspecific proteins other than the P - lactamase , suggesting that the BamHI to Ssp I section of the oxyR clone may carry the oxyR promoter region .
The Sequence of oxyR Reveals Homology to a Family of Transcriptional Activator Proteins in Bacteria .
The DNA sequence of a 1200 - bp region extending from the BamHI site toward the EcoRI site was determined .
The one long open reading frame encoded by the DNA sequence corresponds to a 34.4 - kDa protein extending from the BamHI site toward the EcoRI end ( Fig. 3 ) .
The size and orientation of the protein agree with the maxicell data .
The predicted charge of the OxyR protein ( pI 6.18 - 6.9 ) agrees with the position of the protein on two - dimensional gels probed with antibodies directed against a P3 - galactosidase - OxyR fusion protein ( G.S. and B.N.A. , unpublished results ) , and the codon usage is typical of E. coli ( 23 ) .
To confirm that the reading frame was correct , we created a frameshift mutation by filling - in the unique Tth1ll - I site within oxyR ( a net two - nucleotide insertion ) .
The frameshift mutant was unable to complement the hydrogen - peroxide sensitivity of an oxyR deletion ( data not shown ) .
Comparing the amino - acid sequence of the OxyR protein with sequences in the Dayhoff data bank , we found that OxyR shows extensive homology to the E. coli protein LysR ( Fig. 4 ) .
LysR is a positive regulator of lysA , which encodes the enzyme responsible for the last step in lysine biosynthesis ( 24 , 27 ) .
OxyR also shares significant homology with the Rhizobium meliloti 1021 protein NodD ( 25 ) ( Fig. 4 ) and other Rhizobium NodD proteins ( 28 ) .
NodD regulates several genes involved in the formation of nodules in the symbiotic relationship between Rhizobium and legumes ( 25 , 28 ) .
Henikoff et al. ( 29 ) have recently recognized that these proteins and others [ E. coli IlvY , regulator of ilvC and other genes in the isoleucine - valine biosynthetic pathway ( 30 ) ; E. coli and S. typhimurium CysB , positive regulator of the cysteine regulon ( 31 ) ; S. typhimurium MetR , regulator of the metE and metH genes ( 32 ) ; and the Enterobacter cloacae ampR regulator of the ampC gene , which confers resistance to cephalosporin ( 33 ) ] comprise a family of bacterial regulatory OxyR - A - : A .

Biochemistry : Christman et al. proteins .
The sequence ofPseudomonas aeruginosa trpI , the positive regulator of the trpAB operon , has shown that TrpI is yet another member of the family ( 34 ) .
All of the bacterial regulatory proteins described above are between 30 and 35 kDa in size and act as transcriptional activators .
The most extensive homology is in the N - terminal ends of the proteins , although there is homology throughout the amino - acid sequences .
Start of the oxyR Transcript .
Total cellular RNA was isolated from wild - type and oxyR2 mutant cells .
The start point of the oxyR transcript was determined by extension of a primer hybridizing to the 5 ' region of the oxyR mRNA ( Fig. 5 ) .
The major transcript starts with a G residue .
Corresponding -10 and -35 sequences that contain five of the six residues found in the canonical sigma70 promoters are indicated in Fig. 3 .
The similar levels of the oxyR transcript in both the wild - type and oxyR2 mutant strains indicated by the approximately equal intensity of the primer - extension products suggests that the constitutive phenotype of the oxyR2 mutant is not due to vast overproduction of the oxyR message and protein .
The Constitutive Phenotype of the oxyR2 Mutant Is Due to an Alanine to Valine Missense Mutation .
An oxyR2 mutant strain constitutively overexpresses oxyR - regulated catalase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase activities ( 6 ) .
To learn more about the mechanism of oxyR activation , the mutant oxyR2 gene was cloned .
Chromosomal DNA was isolated from the oxyR2 mutant and digested with EcoRI and BamHI .
Fragments between 2.0 and 2.3 kb were cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pUC18 .
Colonies obtained after transforming oxyRA3 were screened for hybridization to a fragment of the wild - type oxyR clone .
Three oxyR2 clones were isolated in this fashion , of which pAQ22 is one representative .
Although oxyRA3 carrying pAQ22 ( TA4476 ) was very slow growing and pAQ22 was unstable , the strain had increased levels of the oxyR - regulated proteins and increased resistance to hydrogen - peroxide ( data not shown ) .
We sequenced the entire oxyR2 coding region and found that the only difference between oxyR2 and the wild - type sequence was a C - G to T - A missense mutation causing a valine to be substituted for an alanine at amino - acid position 234 .
To confirm that the C - G to T - A missense mutation was in fact the sole mutation to cause the oxyR2 constitutive phenotype , this transition mutation was also generated by site - specific mutagenesis .
The site - specific mutant contained on pUC18 conferred the same phenotypes as pAQ22 , showing that the valine for alanine substitution at position 234 in OxyR is sufficient to cause constitutive induction of hydrogen peroxide - inducible genes .
oxyR Is Negatively Autoregulated by the Binding of OxyR to Its Own Promoter .
To study the expression from the oxyR promoter , the oxyR upstream and promoter region sequences were fused to the lacZ gene on a multicopy vector ( pRS415 ) to give pAQ23 .
This construct was moved into oxyR + ( TA4477 ) and oxyRA3 ( TA4478 ) backgrounds , and the level of 3 - galactosidase activity was determined during exponential growth .
Interestingly , the oxyR : : lacZ fusion gave 5 - fold Proc .
USA 86 ( 1989 ) 3487 higher levels of activity in the oxyR deletion background ( 19,000 units ; A6N = 0.593 ) compared to the oxyR + background ( 3800 units ; A6w = 0.613 ) .
This finding suggests that OxyR is a negative regulator of its own expression .
To learn more about the nature of the repression we investigated the ability of the OxyR protein to bind its own promoter .
Extracts made from cells that greatly overproduce the OxyR protein were added to oxyR promoter fragments and then tested for the ability to protect against DNase I digestion .
A distinct region of protection was seen extending from -27 to +21 relative to the start of the oxyR transcript ( Fig. 6 ) .
This protection is not seen with extracts made from strains that do not overproduce OxyR and suggests that the mechanism by which OxyR negatively autoregulates its expression is by binding to , and therefore blocking , the DNA sequences that are required for its own transcription .
DISCUSSION The cloning and DNA sequence of the E. coli oxyR gene , a positive regulator of a regulon for defenses against oxidative stress , revealed that OxyR is a 34 - kDa protein that shows significant homology to a family of bacterial regulatory proteins .

Start of the oxyR transcript .
The start of the major oxyR transcript in wild - type and oxyR2 4va ~ ~ - mutant cells was determined by primer - extension studies .
Occasional double bands in the adjacent sequencing ladder are due to hybridization between the 30 - base primer and M13 .
Footprint of OxyR on the oxyR promoter .
A 5 ' - end - labeled oxyR promoter fragment was incubated with extracts from an oxyR deletion strain or an OxyR - overproducing strain ( final concentration , 5 and 50 Ag of protein per ml ) and then digested with DNase I as described .
The protection is shown for the noncoding strand .
3488 Biochemistry : Christman et al. negatively regulate their own expression ( 29 ) .
The role of oxyR as a positive regulator has been described ( 6 ) .
The increased expression from a heterologous oxyR : : lacZ gene fusion in an oxyR deletion strain compared to an oxyR ' strain suggests that OxyR is also a negative regulator of its own expression .
Interestingly , while OxyR , LysR , NodD , IlvY , and MetR all negatively regulate their own genes , they positively regulate a transcript from an overlapping promoter on the complementary strand ( 29 , 36 ) .
The oxyR system differs from the other systems in that the transcript made opposite the oxyR structural gene is very small ( only 100 nucleotides ) and probably does not encode a protein ( G.S. and B.N.A. , unpublished data ) .
The footprinting experiments described here suggest that the OxyR protein binds to DNA .
Purified OxyR can also protect specific regions of other oxyR - regulated promoters from DNase I digestion ( G.S. , L. A. Tartaglia , and B.N.A. , unpublished data ) .
Based on sequence analysis , Henikoff et al. ( 29 ) suggest that the LysR class of bacterial regulators have helix - turn - helix motifs toward the N - terminal domains of the proteins , but proof that these helices are interacting with the DNA will require structural studies .
Another member of the LysR class , NodD , has been shown to bind a defined DNA sequence ( NOD box ; ref .
35 ) , and studies on chimeric NodD proteins with C - terminal domains from different strains of Rhizobium do suggest that the N - terminal portion of the protein is involved in DNA recognition ( 28 ) .
The inducer - responsive domain may be near the C terminus .
Our finding that the mutation causing the constitutive phenotype maps within this region supports this claim .
An inducer - independent nodD mutation was also found to map in the C - terminal region of NodD ( ref .
26 ; also indicated in Fig. 4 ) .
It was surprising that the constitutive oxyR2 phenotype was solely due to an alanine to valine missense mutation , but it has been found that an inducer - independent crp mutation can also be caused by an alanine to valine change ( Sankar Adhya , personal communication ) .
Possibly , the slightly larger size of the valine compared to the alanine causes a significant conformational change .
The molecular mechanism by which the OxyR protein is activated by oxidative - stress is of interest .
The fact that the constitutive phenotype of the oxyR2 mutant is due to a missense mutation in OxyR and not due to overproduction of oxyR mRNA suggests that the OxyR protein itself may be modified to induce the regulon under stress conditions .
It may be significant that none of the six cysteine residues found in the OxyR protein is present in LysR or NodD since cysteines might easily be oxidized .
We are using the cloned oxyR gene to overproduce OxyR and to allow purification of the protein to determine the exact manner ofOxyR activation by oxidative - stress .
Note Added in Proof .
We have recently learned that OxyR corresponds to the mom gene repressor ( MomR ) , the methylationdependent regulator of the mom gene of phage Mu ( M. Bolker and R. Kahmann , personal communication ) .
