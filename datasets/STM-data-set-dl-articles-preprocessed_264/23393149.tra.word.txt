Microbiology ( 2013 ) , 159 , 715 -- 725 ompW is cooperatively upregulated by MarA and SoxS in response to menadione B. Collao ,3 E. H. Morales ,3 F. Gil , I. L. Calderón and C. P. Saavedra Correspondence C. P. Saavedra csaavedra@unab.cl Revised 1 February 2013 Laboratorio de Microbiología Molecular , Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas , Universidad Andres Bello , Santiago , Chile OmpW is a minor porin whose biological - function has not been clearly defined .
Evidence obtained in our laboratory indicates that in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium the expression of OmpW is activated by SoxS upon exposure to paraquat and it is required for resistance .
SoxS belongs to the AraC family of transcriptional regulators , like MarA and Rob .
Due to their high structural similarity , the genes under their control have been grouped in the mar/sox/rob regulon , which presents a DNA - binding consensus sequence denominated the marsox box .
In this work , we evaluated the role of the transcription factors MarA , SoxS and Rob of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in regulating ompW expression in response to menadione .
We determined the transcript and protein levels of OmpW in different genetic backgrounds ; in the wild - type and Drob strains ompW was upregulated in response to menadione , while in the DmarA and DsoxS strains the induction was abolished .
In a double marA soxS mutant , ompW transcript levels were lowered after exposure to menadione , and only complementation in trans with both genes restored the positive regulation .
Using transcriptional - fusions and electrophoretic - mobility - shift assays with mutant versions of the promoter region we demonstrated that two of the predicted sites were functional .
Additionally , we demonstrated that MarA increases the affinity of SoxS for the ompW promoter region .
In conclusion , our study shows that ompW is upregulated in response to menadione in a cooperative manner by MarA and SoxS through a direct interaction with the promoter region .
INTRODUCTION Porins are aqueous channels that allow the passive diffusion of hydrophilic solutes , nutrients or toxic compounds through the bacterial outer membrane and participate , at least in part , in the ability of bacteria to adapt to diverse environments , in drug resistance mechanisms and in bacterial pathogenesis ( Benz & Bauer , 1988 ; Chatfield et al. , 1991 ; Jeanteur et al. , 1991 ; Weiss et al. , 1991 ; Groisman & Ochman , 1994 ; Nikaido , 1996 ; Zgurskaya & Nikaido , 2000 ; Koebnik et al. , 2000 ; Rodríguez - Morales et al. , 2006 ) .
Some years ago , Morimyo ( 1988 ) isolated and characterized Escherichia coli mutants sensitive to paraquat , a superoxide - generating compound ( Hassan & Fridovich , 1979 ) .
The deleted region in E. coli is highly conserved in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and contains the ompW gene ( Gil et al. , 2007 ) , which encodes a minor porin that has been well studied and its structure in E. coli and Vibrio cholerae has 3These authors contributed equally to this work .

been described , although its biological - function has not been clearly defined ( Nandi et al. , 2005 ; Hong et al. , 2006 ) .
It is thought to be involved in osmoregulation , since in Vibrio alginolyticus high salt concentrations ( NaCl 4 % ) induce its expression ( Xu et al. , 2005 ) .
Furthermore , a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ceftriaxone - resistant strain showed decreased expression of ompW , suggesting that it might be involved in the uptake of this antibiotic ( Hu et al. , 2005 ) .
Evidence obtained in our laboratory indicates that in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s OmpW expression is increased in the presence of paraquat and it mediates resistance ( Gil et al. , 2007 ) .
The cellular response to superoxide ( O 2 2 ) is regulated at the transcriptional level by the SoxRS system ( Greenberg et al. , 1990 ) .
Upon exposure to O 2 2 and/or ammonium quaternary compounds , SoxR is oxidized and converted to an active form that induces the transcription of soxS , which binds to the promoter regions of several genes whose products are involved in the response to oxidative damage ( Storz & Imlay , 1999 ; Scandalios , 2002 ; Imlay , 2008 ; Gu & Imlay , 2011 ) .
In this context , the evidence supports a model in which ammonium quaternary compounds are responsible for SoxR activation ( Krapp et al. , 2011 ; Gu & Imlay , 2011 ) ; however , it has been recently confirmed that 066050 G 2013 SGM Printed in Great Britain 715 B. Collao and others O 2 2 is also able to oxidize its 2Fe -- 2S cluster ( Fujikawa et al. , 2012 ) .
SoxS belongs to the AraC family of transcriptional regulators , of which MarA and Rob are also members ( Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) .
In E. coli MarA , SoxS and the N - terminal domain of Rob , which include the DNA - binding domain , share approximately 50 % amino acid sequence identity ( Jair et al. , 1995 , 1996 ; Tobes & Ramos , 2002 ) .
The mar/sox/rob regulons overlap and together they co - regulate , by direct binding to the promoter regions , more than 40 different genes ( Aono et al. , 1998 ; Martin et al. , 1999 , 2000 ; Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) .
Expression of MarA , SoxS and Rob is increased upon exposure to a wide variety of signals .
MarA is increased in response to weak acid conditions and salicylate treatment ( Pomposiello et al. , 2001 ) ; SoxS in response to nitric - oxide , superoxide and ammonium quaternary compounds ( Li & Demple , 1994 ; Vasil ' eva et al. , 2001 ) ; and Rob after treatment with bile - salts and dipyridyl ( Storz & Imlay , 1999 ; Semchyshyn et al. , 2005 ; Kwon et al. , 2000 ) .
In E. coli , their upregulation is correlated with changes in the expression of genes involved in the efflux of antibiotics ( acrAB and tolC ) , decrease in outer - membrane permeability ( micF ) , superoxide resistance ( fpr and sodA ) , DNA repair systems ( nfo ) and those with unknown function ( Aono et al. , 1998 ; Pomposiello et al. , 2001 ; Chollet et al. , 2002 , 2004 ; Giró et al. , 2006 ; Lee et al. , 2009 ) .
Due to the high structural similarity among these proteins , genes under their control have been denominated the mar/sox / rob regulon , which present a DNA - binding consensus sequence at their promoter regions , denominated the marsox box which is degenerate and asymmetrical ( AYnGCACnnWnnRYYAAAY ) , and has been detected at various locations on the chromosome of E. coli ( Martin et al. , 2008 ; Aono et al. , 1998 ; Martin et al. , 1999 , 2000 ; Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) .
These binding sites are also configured in a specific orientation and relative distance to the upstream 235 and 210 elements , to which RNA polymerase binds ( Martin & Rosner , 2002 ; Selke et al. , 2007 ) .
Previous work in our laboratory determined that ompW is regulated by SoxS in response to paraquat , and a marsox box has been defined at its promoter region with the sequence 59 - TTTGCATAGCGTGAATATGTCAAAATTGAT - 39 ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) .
Since the binding sites of the members of the mar/sox/rob regulon are similar , in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium Rob and MarA might also regulate ompW in response to menadione , another superoxide - generating compound ( Kato et al. , 1994 ) .
In the present work , we evaluated the effect of menadione on ompW expression and the role of MarA and SoxS in the response .
To evaluate the changes after exposure to menadione , we determined the transcript and protein levels of OmpW in the different genetic backgrounds after exposure to the toxic compound .
In the wild - type and Drob strains , ompW was upregulated in response to menadione , while deletion of MarA or SoxS abolished the regulation .
Bioinformatic analyses predicted the presence of three potential marsox boxes at the ompW promoter region , including the one previously described by Gil et al. ( 2009 ) .
Using transcriptional - fusions and electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( EMSAs ) with the wild - type and mutated promoter regions we demonstrated that two of the predicted sites were functional .
Interestingly , in a double marA soxS mutant strain ompW transcript levels were lowered after menadione exposure , and only complementation in trans with both genes was able to restore the positive regulation observed in the wild - type strain .
In conclusion , we demonstrated that in response to menadione , MarA and SoxS cooperatively regulate ompW through a direct interaction with the promoter region .
METHODS Bacterial strains and growth - conditions .
Salmonella strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Bacteria were grown routinely at 37 uC in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth with shaking .
When required , LB was supplemented with - ampicillin ( 100 mg l 21 ) or kanamycin ( 50 mg l 21 ) .
Solid medium included 15 g agar l 21 .
When necessary , growth medium was treated with menadione ( 50 mM ) .
Bioinformatic analyses in search for marsox boxes at the ompW promoter region were performed using the Vector NTI software using the sequences described by Martin et al. ( 1999 ) and Gil et al. ( 2009 ) .
Construction and cloning of strains .
For the construction of the double mutant strains we used bacteriophage P22 HT105/1 int 2201 using one single - mutant strain as the donor and the other as the recipient ( Ebel - Tsipis et al. , 1972 ) .
The presence of substitution mutations was confirmed by PCR using specific primers ( Table 2 ) .
Genetic complementation of the DsoxS , DmarA , Drob and DmarA soxS strains was performed using plasmids pBR322 - soxS , pBR322 - marA , pBR322 - rob and pBR322 - marA - soxS , respectively .
To generate these plasmids , S. enterica serovar Typhimurium soxS , marA and rob genes were amplified by PCR using primers listed in Table 2 .
The PCR was performed under the following conditions : 10 min at 95 uC , followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 uC , 45 s at 55 uC and 1 min at 72 uC , and a final extension of 10 min at 72 uC .
The restriction sites ( EcoRI and BamHI ) at the ends of the DNA fragment were introduced in the PCR primers ( sequences in bold type in Table 2 ) and were digested with the corresponding enzymes .
The digested PCR product was cloned into the multiple cloning site ( MCS ) of pBR322 .
To generate plasmid pBR322 - marA -- soxS primers pBR322 with pBR322 and pBR322 with pBR322 ( Table 2 ) were used to generate overlapping PCR products spanning the divergent construct marA -- soxS , taking advantage of the complementary sequence added ( sequences in italic type in Table 2 ) .
The resulting PCR products were used as templates in a second reaction with primers pBR322 and pBR322 to generate the divergent construct , which was digested and cloned into the MCS of plasmid pBR322 .
RNA isolation and mRNA detection .
An overnight bacterial culture was diluted 100 - fold with fresh LB - medium and was grown at 37 uC with shaking to OD 600 ~ 0.4 .
The culture was split into two 10 ml aliquots and one of them was incubated with 50 mM menadione .
Cells were grown at 37 uC and 4 ml aliquots were withdrawn 20 min after menadione exposure .
Total RNA was extracted using the GenElute Total RNA purification kit ( Sigma ) following the manufacturer 's 716 Microbiology 159 MarA and SoxS regulate ompW expression Table 1 .
Primers used in this study Underlined sequences indicate restriction sites for KpnI orHindIII which were introduced in the primers .
Sequences in bold type indicate restriction sites for EcoRI or BamHI introduced in the primers .
Sequences in italics represent complementary sequences added to generate overlapping PCR products to produce the divergent marA - soxS construct as described in Methods .
Total RNA was treated with 2 U DNase I to remove trace amounts of DNA .
cDNA synthesis was carried out at 37 uC for 1 h in 25 ml of a mixture that contained 2.5 pmol of the specific primers , 10 ml template - RNA ( 5 mg ) , 0.2 mM dNTPs , 1 ml sterile water , 4 ml56 buffer [ 250 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.3 , 375 mM KCl , 15 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM DTT , 40 U RNasin and 200 U MMLV reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) ] .
Relative quantification of the transcript levels of ompW , marA , rob and soxS by real - time RT - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) was performed using the Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Reagent kit and the Mx3000P detection system ( Stratagene ) .
16S rRNA levels were used for normalization .
The qRT - PCR mixture ( 20 ml ) contained 1 ml cDNA template and 120 nM of each primer [ and for the ompW gene , and for the marA gene , and for the soxS gene , and for the rob gene , and and for the 16S rRNA gene ( 16S ) ( Table 2 ) ] .
The qRT - PCR was performed under the following conditions : 10 min at 95 uC , followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 uC , 45 s at 53 uC and 30 s at 72 uC , followed by a melting cycle from 53 to 95 uC to check for amplification specificity .
A standard quantification curve with serial dilutions of RT - PCR products was constructed for each gene to calculate the amplification efficiency .
These values were used to obtain the ratio between the gene of interest and the expression of the 16S rRNA gene as described by Pfaffl ( 2001 ) .
All experiments were performed in three biological and technical replicates .
Briefly , E. coli BL21 cells harbouring plasmid pET - TOPO - soxS or marA were grown in 500 ml LB - medium supplemented with - ampicillin ( 100 mg ml 21 ) to OD 600 ~ 0.4 and protein overexpression was carried out by adding 1 mM IPTG with further growth for 6 h. His - tagged SoxS and MarA used in EMSAs were purified as previously described ( Collao et al. , 2012 ) .
Immunoblotting using an anti - FLAG M2 mAb ( Sigma ) detected a 36FLAG - containing fusion protein .
Strains carrying the epitope - tagged construct were grown at 37 uC with shaking to OD 600 ~ 0.4 .
The culture was split into two 10 ml aliquots , one of which was incubated with 50 mM menadione .
Cultures were 718 Microbiology 159 MarA and SoxS regulate ompW expression grown at 37 uC and after 20 min of exposure cells were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 3 min .
Bacterial pellets were suspended in 100 mM Tris / HCl ( pH 8.0 ) and subjected to three rounds of sonication of 30 s each .
After centrifuging at 13 000 g for 5 min , the pelleted material was subjected to SDS - PAGE and size - separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes , incubated with anti- FLAG antibody M2 ( 1 : 1000 dilution ) upon which the FLAG epitope was detected with peroxidase - conjugated anti - mouse IgG and peroxidase activity .
Construction of transcriptional - fusions with the reporter gene lacZ .
The native ompW promoter region from positions +1 to2600 ( with respect to the translation start site ) was amplified by PCR with primers and using genomic DNA from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium as a template ( strain 14028s ) .
The restriction sites ( KpnIandHindIII , respectively ) at the ends of the DNA fragment were introduced by the PCR primers ( underlined sequences in Table 2 ) and were digested with the corresponding enzymes .
The digested PCR product was cloned into the MCS of the b - galactosidase reporter vector pLacZ - Basic ( GenBank accession no .
U13184 ) ( Clontech ) , generating plasmid pompW - lacZ .
To generate plasmids pMutA - lacZ , pMutB - lacZ and pMutC - lacZ , primers -600 Fw with , or and with , or ( Table 2 ) were used to generate overlapping PCR products spanning the whole length of the ompW promoter .
The PCR was performed under the following conditions : 5 min at 95 uC , followed by 10 cycles of 30 s at 94 uC , 30 s at 40 uC and2minat72uC , followed by 10 cycles of 30 s at 94 uC , 30 s at 45 uCand2minat72uC , and 20 cycles of 30 s at 94 uC , 30 s at 50 uC and2minat72uC , and a final extension of 10 min at 72 uC .
The resulting PCR products were used as templates in a second reaction with primers and +1 Rv to generate the mutated ompW promoter , which was digested and cloned into the MCS of plasmid pLacZ - Basic .
PCR conditions were 10 min at 95 uC , followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 uC , 30 s at 55 uCand1minat72uC , and a final extension of 10 min at 72 uC .
Mutation of other sites was generated the same way , generating plasmids pMutAB - lacZ , pMutAC - lacZ , pMutBC - lacZ and pMutABC - lacZ .
Constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing .
The constructs were transformed into strain 14028s .
To evaluate activity , cells at OD 600 ~ 0.4 weregrownfor20mininthepresenceof50mM menadione .
Control cells received no treatment .
b - Galactosidase activity was determined as previously described by Gil et al. ( 2007 ) .
To study protein binding to the promoter region of ompW , a non - radioactive EMSA was performed according to the protocol described by De la Cruz et al. ( 2007 ) .
The probes were obtained by PCR using specific primers and +1 Rv to amplify the promoter region of ompW ( 600 bp ) and pOmpW with pOmpW ( Table 2 ) for the negative control encompassing the coding region of ompW ( 130 bp ) .
The PCR was performed under the following conditions : 10 min at 95 uC , followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 uC , 30 s at 55 uC and 1 min at 72 uC , and a final extension of 10 min at 72 uC .
PCR products used in EMSAs with mutations in the mar/sox/rob boxes A , B and C were generated using primers -600 Fw and +1 Rv , and plasmids pMutAB - lacZ , pMutAC - lacZ , pMutBC - lacZ and pMutABC - lacZ as templates .
Both the promoter region and the negative control ( ~ 2 ng ml 21 ) were mixed with increasing amounts of purified MarA or SoxS in the presence of binding buffer [ 20 mM HEPES , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA , 20 % ( v/v ) glycerol ] .
The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and loaded on a native 6 % polyacrylamide gel in 0.56 Tris/borate -- EDTA buffer .
The DNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining on a UV transilluminator .
All primers used in this work were designed using the Vector NTI 10 Software .
RESULTS ompW is positively regulated after menadione treatment In order to evaluate the effect of menadione on the expression of ompW , we analysed the transcript levels in a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium wild - type strain treated with the toxic compound .
As shown in Fig. 1 ( a ) , ompW transcript levels were increased ( 20.22 ± 1.70 fold changes ) as compared with control untreated cells .
To correlate the changes in the levels of transcripts with the gene product OmpW ( ~ 21 kDa ) and evaluate possible post - transcriptional regulation , we constructed translational fusions in the wild - type strain and evaluated their levels as described in Methods .
In agreement with qRT - PCR analysis , OmpW levels were increased as compared with those of untreated cells ( Fig. 1b ) .
ompW is positively regulated by MarA and SoxS We previously demonstrated that SoxS positively regulates ompW in response to paraquat ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) .
Since MarA , SoxS and Rob co - regulate several genes ( Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) , we evaluated ompW transcript levels in the different genetic backgrounds by qRT - PCR after exposure to menadione .
As shown in Fig. 2a , b , in strains DmarA and DsoxS the transcript levels were decreased after exposure to menadione ( 0.27 ± 0.08 and 0.17 ± 0.01 fold changes , respectively , versus a 20 - fold increase in wild - type cells exposed to the toxic compound ) .
In contrast , in the rob mutant strain they were upregulated to similar levels as those found in the wild - type strain after the treatment ( 11.42 ± 0.52 fold change , Fig .
S1a , available with the online version of this paper ) .

the positive regulation observed in the wild - type strain ( Fig. 2a , b ) .
To further confirm our result , we generated translational fusions of ompW in the DmarA and DsoxS genetic backgrounds and determined the protein levels by performing a Western blot .
As shown in Fig S1 ( a ) , the positive regulation observed in the wild - type strain after menadione treatment was retained in the Drob strain ( Fig S1b ) , while in DmarA and DsoxS strains it was abolished ( Fig. 2a -- c ) .
Taken together , qRT - PCR and Western blot analyses suggest that MarA and SoxS are required to positively regulate ompW in response to menadione , while Rob is not involved in this response .
MarA and SoxS bind to the ompW promoter region To evaluate if the regulation of ompW by MarA and SoxS was due to a direct interaction , we performed EMSAs to determine if the purified proteins were able to bind to its promoter region .
The bioinformatic analysis predicted the presence of three putative mar/sox/rob boxes ( Fig. 3a ) , two novel ones named MS - A and MS - B , in addition to the previously identified SoxS - binding site ( MS - C ) described by Gil et al. ( 2009 ) .
All three binding sites presented the two characteristic elements described at marsox boxes , CWA and the highly conserved GCAY ( Li & Demple , 1994 ) , which are required for the stability of the interaction and for protein binding , respectively ( Li & Demple , 1996 ) .
To confirm the interactions , we performed EMSAs using a PCR product spanning the promoter region from positions 2600 to +1 with respect to the transcription start site , with increasing concentrations of purified MarA or SoxS .
As a negative control , a PCR product that included a region from +1 to +130 of ompW was used .
Both MarA and SoxS were able to bind to the wild - type promoter ( Fig. 3c , d ) , although at different concentrations .
MarA generated a change in the electrophoretic mobility at a concentration of 100 nM , while SoxS required 400 nM ( Fig. 3c , d , respectively , fragment A ) .
Mutation of the GCAY element to AAAY ( Fig. 3a ) in the three predicted boxes required doubling of the amount of both MarA and SoxS to generate a shift in the electrophoretic mobility as compared with that of the wild - type promoter , while mutating MS - A and MS - C together completely abolished the interaction with both proteins ( Fragments F and H , Fig. 3c , d ) , suggesting that they are required for binding in - vitro .
The promoter region of ompW has two functional marsox boxes To determine which marsox boxes were functional in - vivo , we constructed transcriptional - fusions of the ompW promoter region with the fragments used for EMSAs , schematized in Fig. 3 ( a ) .
The different constructs were transformed into strain 14028s and b - galactosidase activity was measured .

strain 14028s with the wild - type construct ( A ) .
Cells containing the wild - type promoter ( A ) or MS - B mutated ( C ) showed a twofold increase in b - galactosidase activity after exposure to the toxic compound ( Fig. 3b ) , indicating that MS - B is dispensable for ompW upregulation by MarA and SoxS in response to menadione .
However , individually mutating MS - A and MS - C or mutating both together resulted in no regulation after exposure to the toxic compound ( Fig. 3b , fragments B , D , E , F , G and H ) , indicating that both sites are required for the positive regulation by MarA and SoxS in strain 14028s , results which are in agreement with those from EMSAs .
Both MarA and SoxS are required for ompW positive regulation To determine whether MarA and SoxS individually regulated ompW in response to menadione or if they were both required , we generated a double DmarA soxS strain and measured ompW transcript levels in the presence or absence of menadione .
As observed in the individual mutants , ompW levels remained decreased in the DmarA soxS strain after treatment with the toxic compound ( 0.29 ± 0.05 fold change , Fig. 4 ) .

Collao and others Relative transcript levels 10 8 6 4 2 0 C M ΔmarA soxS ** C M C M C M ΔmarA soxS / ΔmarA soxS / ΔmarA soxS / pBR322 - marA pBR322 - soxS DNA probe ( Fig. 3b , fragment C ) , suggesting that the affinity of SoxS for the promoter region of ompW increases in the presence of MarA .
In agreement with this , using a constant amount of SoxS ( 0.8 mM ) and increasing amounts of MarA ( 33 -- 200 nM ) resulted in a similar shift with a higher molecular mass to that observed for the individual proteins ( Fig. 5b ) .
As observed for SoxS , lower levels of MarA were required to form the high - molecular - mass complex ( 100 nM ) than when the protein was incubated alone with the ompW promoter ( 200 nM ) , suggesting the same increased affinity for the promoter region as observed in the case of SoxS .
Taken together , our results indicate that both MarA and SoxS are required to positively regulate ompW and that they cooperatively bind to the promoter region .
Requirement for MarA and SoxS for ompW positive regulation .
ompW transcript levels were measured in a double marA soxS mutant strain , individually complemented ( DmarA soxS / pBR322 - marA and DmarA soxS/pBR322 - soxS ) and complemented with both genes ( DmarA soxS/pBR322 - marA soxS ) .
Exponentially growing cells were exposed to menadione ( 50 mM ) for 20 min .
Controls received no treatment .
Experiments were repeated three times and asterisks represent statistically significant differences between the control and treated cells for each strain ( ** P ¡ 0.005 ) ; values are means ± SD .
C , control ; M , menadione .
the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium soxS or marA gene ( DmarA soxS/pB322 - soxS and DmarA soxS/pB322 - marA , respectively ) , the transcript levels remained decreased after menadione treatment ( 0.354 ± 0.1 and 0.314 ± 0.06 fold change , respectively , Fig. 4 ) .
In contrast , when the double mutant strain was complemented with a plasmid coding for both marA and soxS ( DmarA soxS/pB322 - marA soxS ) , the positive regulation was partially restored to levels similar to those observed in the wild - type strain exposed to menadione ( 6.81 ± 1.13 fold change , Fig. 4 ) , indicating that both MarA and SoxS are required for positive regulation .
MarA and SoxS work cooperatively Since both MarA and SoxS were required to positively regulate ompW , we hypothesized that the two proteins might act cooperatively .
To evaluate this possibility , we performed EMSAs with the ompW promoter mutated at MS - B ( fragment C , Fig. 3a ) , constant amounts of either MarA ( Fig. 5a ) or SoxS ( Fig. 5b ) , and increasing amounts of the corresponding counterpart .
When MarA remained constant ( 200 nM ) , adding increasing amounts of SoxS , from 0.0125 to 0.8 mM , resulted in a shift to a higher molecular mass than that generated by the individual proteins ( Fig. 5a ) .
Interestingly , even at the lower concentrations of SoxS ( 0.0125 mM ) the high - molecularmass complex was observed , while incubating with SoxS alone required 0.4 mM to produce a shift using the same DISCUSSION The OmpW protein is an immunogenic 22 kDa ( Jalajakumari & Manning , 1990 ) minor porin and has been related to osmoprotection ( Hu et al. , 2005 ) , the efflux and resistance towards paraquat ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) and the influx of hydrogen - peroxide and hypochlorous acid ( Morales et al. , 2012 ) .
It is regulated by diverse environmental conditions including temperature , salinity , nutrient availability , oxygen levels ( Nandi et al. , 2005 ) , paraquat ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) and reactive oxygen species ( Morales et al. , 2012 ) , among others , and is differentially regulated at the transcriptional level by FNR ( anaerobiosis ) , ArcA ( H 2 O 2 and NaOCl ) and SoxS ( paraquat ) ( Bouchal et al. , 2010 ; Morales et al. , 2012 ; Gil et al. , 2009 ) .
In this work , we demonstrate that both SoxS and MarA , whose response overlap and together co - regulate over 40 genes ( Aono et al. , 1998 ; Martin et al. , 1999 , 2000 ; Martin & Rosner , 2002 ) , were required for the positive regulation of ompW after menadione treatment ( Figs 2 and 4 ) .
Consistent with this , both transcription factors are upregulated in response to the toxic compound ( Fig S2 ) , and SoxS is required to regulate ompW in response to paraquat ( Gil et al. , 2009 ) .
Our results indicate that there are two functional mar/sox boxes that are required for the positive regulation in response to menadione ( Fig. 3 ) .
These sites are located approximately 100 nt upstream from the ArcA - binding site ( from 270 to 255 ) , required for the negative regulation in response to H 2 O 2 and NaOCl ( Morales et al. , 2012 ) .
This suggests that under the assayed conditions , ArcA is not active , since , as observed in the presence of NaOCl , when ArcA , MarA and SoxS are present , ompW is negatively regulated .
It is plausible to speculate that under those conditions ArcA could bind to the 235 element and impede binding of the sigma factor , explaining why , although both MarA and SoxS are present , ompW is negatively regulated .
In contrast , in response to menadione ArcA could be inactive , allowing MarA and SoxS to exert their regulation , although this has not been evaluated .

Interaction of MarA and SoxS at the ompW promoter region .
Constant concentrations of purified MarA ( a ) or SoxS ( b ) were incubated with increasing concentrations of SoxS or MarA , respectively , and the wild - type promoter of ompW ( fragment B ) .
The interactions were resolved by native PAGE ( 6 % ) .
Bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining .
The different DNA -- protein complexes are indicated .
Our results indicate that Rob is not involved in the regulation of ompW ( Fig .
S1 ) , indicating that it is regulated in a different manner as compared with other genes that are members of the extensively studied mar/sox/rob regulon , like tolC in E. coli , which is positively regulated by all of them in response to salicylate , paraquat and 2,29 - dipyridyl ( Zhang et al. , 2008 ) .
In addition , previous work indicates that rob is repressed by MarA due to steric hindrance and in E. coli SoxS modulates its expression in response to paraquat ( McMurry & Levy , 2010 ; Michán et al. , 2002 ) .
Furthermore , studies in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium showed that the transcript and protein levels of marA and soxS are increased , while those of rob are lowered in a wild - type strain treated with sodium hypochlorite ( Collao et al. , 2012 ) , suggesting a similar mechanism .
To investigate the mechanism by which MarA and SoxS regulate ompW , we performed EMSAs and used transcriptional fusions of the promoter region ( Figs 3 and 5 ) .
Our results indicate that both proteins are required for positive regulation and that they act in a cooperative manner ( Figs 4 and 5 ) .
In this context , several reports provide evidence that two transcription factors work cooperatively in response to the same signal , as in Vibrio vulnificus , where the nan operon is negatively regulated by CRP and NanR in the presence of N - acetylmannosamine 6 - phosphate ( Kim et al. , 2011 ) .
Also , in E. coli CRP requires the presence of RhaR to efficiently activate rhaSR in - vivo in response to L - rhamnose ( Wickstrum et al. , 2005 ) .
Similarly , studies in Haemophilus influenzae suggest that CRP and SiaR regulate their respective operators by simultaneously binding to an intergenic region between nan and siaPT , where SiaR functions as both a repressor and activator , using glucosamine - 6-phosphate as a co - activator , and interacts with CRP to regulate these divergent promoters ( Johnston et al. , 2010 ) .
Furthermore , in Myxococcus xanthus MrPC2 and FruA bind cooperatively to three sites at the fmgE promoter region , and it has been proposed that one site is necessary to recruit MrpC2 and FruA to the promoter , while the other two are required to activate it ( Son et al. , 2011 ) .
However , most of these studies mainly show that the effect on the target genes is synergic .
In contrast , our results indicate that MarA and SoxS are required to positively modulate ompW expression ( Figs 4 and 5 ) .
To our knowledge , this is the first report demonstrating such an effect .
Further studies addressing whether this is a common feature of regulation of gene expression by MarA and SoxS , novel targets subject to similar regulation , and the mechanism by which these proteins interact are under examination in our laboratory .
