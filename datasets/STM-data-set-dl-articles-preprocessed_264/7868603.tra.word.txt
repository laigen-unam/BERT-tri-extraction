177 , No. 5 0021 - 9193/95 / $ 04.00 0 Mutational Analysis of the Redox - Sensitive Transcriptional Regulator OxyR : Regions Important for DNA Binding and Multimerization INES KULLIK , † JENNIFER STEVENS , ‡ MICHEL B. TOLEDANO , § AND GISELA STORZ * Cell Biology and Metabolism Branch , National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 OxyR is a LysR - type transcriptional regulator which negatively regulates its own expression and positively regulates the expression of proteins important for the defense against hydrogen - peroxide in Eschericha coli and Salmonella typhimurium .
Using random mutagenesis , we isolated six nonrepressing OxyR mutants that were impaired in DNA binding .
Five of the mutations causing the DNA binding defect mapped near the N - terminal helix - turn - helix motif conserved among the LysR family members , confirming that this region is a DNA binding domain in OxyR .
The sixth nonrepressing mutant ( with E - 225 changed to K [ E225K ] ) was found to be predominantly dimeric , in contrast to the tetrameric wild - type protein , suggesting that a C - terminal region defined by the E225K mutation is involved in multimerization .
The Escherichia coli OxyR protein is a redox - sensitive transcriptional regulator which activates the expression of antioxidant defense genes under oxidizing conditions .
During normal growth and upon oxidative - stress , OxyR also acts as a repressor and negatively autoregulates its own expression and the expression of the Mu phage mom gene ( 8 , 16 , 34 ) .
OxyR specifically binds upstream of the promoters it regulates , but the seven natural binding sites which have been characterized only show limited homology ( 35 ) .
Recent studies of 54 synthetic binding sites , however , allowed the definition of an oxidized - OxyR binding motif composed of four ATAGxt elements ( 37 ) .
OxyR - DNase I footprints are long and cover 45 bp , and hydroxyl radical footprinting and interference assays showed that the oxidized OxyR protein binds to the four ATAGxt elements by contacting the DNA in four adjacent major grooves ( 37 ) .
These footprinting assays also showed that OxyR binding is different under oxidizing and reducing conditions ( 32 , 37 ) .
OxyR is a member of the family of LysR - type transcriptional regulators ( 8 , 16 , 33 , 39 ) .
LysR family members are DNAbinding proteins which positively regulate expression of their target genes and often also negatively regulate their own expression ( reviewed in reference 28 ) .
Sequence comparisons among LysR family members have shown that the region encompassing the 66 N - terminal amino - acids exhibits the greatest sequence identity and includes a helix - turn - helix ( HTH ) motif likely to be a DNA binding domain ( 28 ) .
Mutations which map to the HTH region lead to a loss of DNA binding by Pseudomonas putida NahR ( 29 ) , Rhizobium leguminosarum NodD ( 11 ) , and other LysR - type proteins .
Parts of the C - terminal domains of LysR - type proteins also seem to contribute to DNA binding , since several mutations in this region of P. putida NahR ( 29 ) and Citrobacter freundii AmpR ( 6 ) affect DNA binding .

Like OxyR , other LysR family members protect unusually long regions from DNase I digestion .
The long binding sites suggest that the LysR proteins may be multimeric , and E. coli MetR ( 25 ) , Rhizobium meliloti NodD3 ( 17 ) , and Klebsiella aerogenes Nac ( 19 ) have been reported to be dimers , while NahR ( 29 ) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa TrpI ( 14 ) , and Salmonella typhimurium CysB ( 26 ) have been found to be tetramers .
The regions involved in multimerization are not yet well defined ; however , some of the C - terminal mutations in NahR and also in AmpR are not negative trans dominant , suggesting that they might affect a multimerization domain ( 6 , 29 ) .
In this study , we used random mutagenesis to define regions of the OxyR protein involved in DNA binding .
We were able to show that the proposed HTH motif in OxyR is a DNA binding domain , since several mutations in this region led to impaired DNA binding of the mutant proteins .
Moreover , we found that the oxidized and reduced forms of OxyR are predominantly tetrameric , while one binding mutant and one constitutively active mutant , described in the accompanying paper ( 21 ) , were dimeric , suggesting that the C - terminal region affected by these mutations is involved in tetramerization .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and plasmids .
The strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1 .
The strain GSO7 was constructed as follows .
The 0.2 - kb HindII - SspI fragment of pAQ17 carrying the oxyS and oxyR promoter region ( 16 ) was cloned into the unique SmaI site of pTS7 ( 1 ) to create the galK fusion .
The plasmid was then recombined onto Y2055 ( cI857 galK nin5 ) and integrated into the att site of SA2692 .
A oxyR : : kan deletion - insertion mutation was subsequently moved into the strain by P1 transduction ( 3 ) .
The pACYC184 derivative pAQ5 used for the mutagenesis contains oxyR on a BamHI - EcoRV fragment ( 31 ) .
A BamHI - HindIII fragment of these clones was moved into M13mp18 for sequencing .
All sequencing and subcloning were carried out by standard procedures .
Strains were grown in LB - medium ( 27 ) , and ampicillin ( 100 g/ml [ final concentration ] ) , kanamycin ( 25 g/ml ) , chloramphenicol ( 25 g/ml ) , or tetracycline ( 15 g/ml ) was added when appropriate .
The resistance of strains to hydrogen - peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide was assayed by zones of inhibition , which were determined as described previously ( 15 ) except that the strains were grown in and plated on LB - medium containing the appropriate antibiotics .
Approximately 10 g of purified pAQ5 plasmid DNA was randomly mutagenized with hydroxylamine as described in the accompanying paper ( 21 ) .
The mutagenized DNA mixture ( 5 to 10 l ) was then used to transform E. coli XL1 - blue cells directly .
The transformants were rinsed off the plates , and the plasmid DNA was isolated and used to transform the GSO7 recipient strain .

Finally , the GSO7 transformants were screened for the desired phenotype on MacConkey agar plates .
Cells were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.4 , and then half of each sample was treated with hydrogen - peroxide ( 200 M final concentration ) for 10 min .
Total RNA was isolated by using hot phenol , and 0.1 pmol of an end - labeled oxyS oligonucleotide ( 5 - GCAAAAGTTCACGT TGG ) was annealed to 3 g of total RNA as described previously ( 30 [ short protocol ] ) .
The extension reaction was performed with Superscript reverse transcriptase from Gibco BRL ( Gaithersburg , Md. ) in the reaction buffer provided .
The extension products were separated on an 8 % sequencing gel and were quantitated with a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) .
Proteins were separated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate -- 12 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel ( 22 ) and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter by electroblotting .
The filter was then probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of antibodies to an OxyR -- - galactosidase fusion protein ( 32 ) .
Bound antibody was visualized with rabbit aniserum by using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting ( immunoblotting ) system from Amersham , Arlington Heights , Ill. .
Binding reactions were carried out as described previously with 5,000 cpm of an end - labeled DNA fragment and either 1 to 10 ng of pure protein ( 21 ) or 1 to 2 l of the soluble fraction of a crude cell lysate ( 36 ) .
For the mobility - shift assays , the binding reaction mixtures were loaded on a nondenaturing , low - ionic - strength , 8 % polyacrylamide gel ( 5 ) .
To prepare the crude cell extract , the pellet from a 5 - ml overnight culture was sonicated in 800 l of 10 mM Tris buffer ( pH 8 ) containing 20 % glycerol .
The insoluble fraction was then removed by centrifugation .
The samples for the galactokinase assays were obtained as described previously ( 2 ) .
The assays were carried out as described by Wilson and Hogness ( 40 ) .
D - [ 1 - 14 C ] galactose ( 55 mCi/mmol ; 200 Ci/ml ) was obtained from Amersham , and the ion - exchange filter paper ( DE81 ) was obtained from Whatman ( Maidstone , England ) .
About 1 to 2 mg of pure protein ( 21 ) mixed with standard proteins ( Bio - Rad , Richmond , Calif. ) in a 200 - l volume was applied to a Superose 12 gel filtration column ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , N.J. ) equilibrated with buffer Z ( 21 ) containing 0.3 M KCl .
The proteins were eluted with the same buffer Z , and aliquots of the column fractions were analyzed by immunoblots .
oxyR - galK transcriptional - fusion used to screen for OxyR nonrepressing mutants .
OxyR bound to the oxyR - oxyS promoter region represses its own expression under both oxidizing and reducing conditions and activates oxyS transcription upon oxidation .
RESULTS Screen for nonrepressing OxyR mutants .
To characterize OxyR domains required for DNA binding , we chose to randomly mutagenize the entire oxyR gene and screen for mutants defective in DNA binding .
To easily identify mutants , we constructed a transcriptional - fusion between the oxyR promoter and the galK reporter gene .
When OxyR binds to this site at the overlapping oxyR and oxyS promoters ( Fig. 1 ) , OxyR represses the expression of the oxyR gene independent of the oxidative state of the protein .
Under oxidizing conditions , OxyR also acts to induce expression of the divergently transcribed oxyS gene , which encodes a small , untranslated regulatory RNA ( 4 ) .
Since binding of the OxyR protein to the DNA is assumed to be required for repression , mutant OxyR proteins which are not able to repress oxyR expression are likely to be DNAbinding mutants .
The oxyR - galK fusion was integrated into the chromosome of E. coli SA2692 , and subsequently a oxyR : : kan deletion was moved into the strain by P1 transduction to generate GSO7 .
Plasmids carrying the oxyR gene were mutagenized by hydroxylamine in - vitro and introduced into this background .
The abilities of the different mutants to repress oxyR expression were monitored on MacConkey agar plates containing galactose as a carbon source .
In GSO7 , wild - type OxyR repressed the expression of the oxyR - galK fusion , resulting in white colonies , while mutants that were unable to repress this fusion were detected as red colonies .
More than 10 6 colonies were screened for nonrepressing mutants with the oxyR - galK fusion strain , and 32 candidates were isolated .
Since a truncated or unstable form of OxyR would also lead to red colonies in GSO7 , we checked whether crude extracts of strains harboring the corresponding oxyR mutations expressed a full - length OxyR protein .
Ten of the 32 candidates did not show any detectable OxyR protein in an immunoblot assay , and one of the candidates expressed a truncated protein .
The other 21 candidates showed a full - length protein , and the expression of OxyR was elevated approximately 50 - fold compared with that in the wild - type strain ( see below ) , consistent with the observation that these mutants are unable to act as repressors of the oxyR promoter .
The mutants were then tested for their sensitivities to hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide in a growth inhibition assay .
All showed a larger killing zone than the wild - type strain , indicating that they were more sensitive to the oxidants than the wild - type strain ( Table 2 ) .
The increased sensitivity to oxidants , and also to peroxides presumed to be in the medium , most likely accounts for the impaired ability of the mutant strains to form single colonies .
As observed for the oxyR : : kan strain , the single colonies grew only near heavy streaks of cells .
Five nonrepressing mutations map near the HTH motif .
To determine the locations and natures of the mutations , the mutant oxyR genes were sequenced entirely .
Six different mutations , all causing single amino - acid changes , were found VOL .

among the 21 nonrepressing candidates ( Table 2 ) .
With one exception , all of the nonrepressing mutations were located in or within 15 amino - acids of the HTH motif of the OxyR protein presumed to be involved in DNA binding ( Fig. 2 ) .
The region around the HTH motif displays the highest level of sequence similarity among LysR - type proteins , and amino - acid S - 33 is one of the most conserved amino - acids .
We found that the mutant with a change of S - 33 to N ( S33N ) had a very severe mutant phenotype and was even more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide than the oxyR : : kan strain .
The mutations R4C and R50W also affect strongly conserved amino - acids .
One mutation , E225K , is not located near the HTH motif , and the failure of this mutant to repress oxyR expression is thought to be due to a defect in multimerization of the protein ( see below ) .
One nonrepressing mutant protein was sequenced even though immunoblot analysis revealed the protein to be slightly smaller than the wild - type OxyR protein .
This mutant carried an amber mutation at position 283 and was not able to complement an oxyR deletion strain ( data not shown ) .
Since a C - terminal deletion of only 22 amino - acids resulted in a nonrepressing phenotype , this region may be important for DNA binding and may contact the DNA , be required for multimerization , or be crucial for the appropriate folding of the protein .
A previously described strain expressing OxyR with a deletion of only 11 C - terminal amino - acids showed a wild - type phenotype in the peroxide sensitivity assay , suggesting that this truncated protein is still able to bind DNA ( data not shown ) ( 16 ) .
Nonrepressing mutants show decreased expression of defense genes .
The ability of OxyR to bind DNA was assumed to be required for both repression and activation of transcription .
Since all of the nonrepressing mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to oxidants , we examined whether the mutant proteins were impaired in activating transcription of defense genes in - vivo and whether the activity of the mutants would still be affected by oxidation .
Total RNA was isolated from untreated and hydrogen - peroxide - treated cultures of strains expressing the different nonrepressing mutants .
The levels of the OxyRactivated oxyS message were then determined by primer - extension assays ( Fig. 3 ) .
As expected , some of the mutants ( T31M , S33N , and R50W ) showed no activation of oxyS .
Three mutants ( R4C , L32F , and E225K ) , however , could still activate transcription under oxidizing conditions , although the abilities FIG. 2 .

The alignment was done with the Genetics Computer Group program PILEUP with default parameters .
Primer extension assays of oxyS induction in nonrepressing OxyR mutants .
Exponential - phase cultures expressing the indicated OxyR mutants were split , and half of each culture was treated with 200 M hydrogen - peroxide for 10 min .
Total RNA was then isolated from the treated ( ) and untreated ( ) cells , and a labeled oligonucleotide capable of hybridizing to the oxyS transcript was incubated with 3 g of each RNA sample and extended with reverse transcriptase .
of these mutants to induce oxyS expression were reduced to 5 to 15 % of the wild - type activity .
The S33N mutant was also assayed for its effect on the expression of the OxyR - regulated ahpC and dps genes , but as with oxyS , no transcriptional activation was detected ( data not shown ) .
DNA binding by nonrepressing mutants .
We next examined the DNA binding properties of the nonrepressing mutants by DNase I footprinting and DNA mobility - shift assays .
Extracts from strains carrying a chromosomal deletion of oxyR and either the wild - type or the mutant oxyR genes on pACYC184 were assayed for binding to an oxyR - oxyS promoter fragment .
No DNase I footprint was observed for the nonrepressing FIG. 4 .

Equal aliquots ( 1 l ) of the extracts were incubated with a 100 - bp EcoRI - HindIII fragment of pGSO40 ( 37 ) labeled at the HindIII site .
The bound and unbound fragments were then separated on a low - ionicstrength polyacrylamide gel .

mutants ( Fig. 4 in reference 21 and data not shown ) .
However , when DNA binding was assayed in a more sensitive gel - retardation experiment , two of the mutants ( L32F and E225K ) showed a retarded band ( Fig. 4A ) .
The immunoblot in Fig. 4B shows that a full - length OxyR protein was present in all of the mutant extracts but that the mutant strains expressed higher levels of OxyR protein than the wild - type strain , in agreement with the nonrepressing phenotype of the mutants .
Since equal amounts of total protein were assayed for all of the strains and the wild - type strain expressed significantly lower levels of OxyR , the relative binding affinity of the nonrepressing mutants is even lower than indicated by the intensity of the shifted band .
The weak binding observed with mutants L32F and E225K correlates well with the weak transcriptional activity seen for these mutants in - vivo .
Only mutant R4C did not show any detectable binding to DNA but could slightly activate oxyS expression .
Interestingly , the E225K mutant led to a faster - migrating protein - DNA complex than the wild - type strain and mutant L32F .
We had observed a similar faster - migrating complex in gel - retardation experiments with extracts of a strain expressing the constitutively active A233V mutant described in the accompanying paper ( 21 ) .
To study the E225K and A233V proteins in - vitro , the nonrepressing and constitutively active mutants were overexpressed and purified ( 21 ) .
When the gel retardation experiment was repeated with the pure proteins , it was obvious that both mutants showed protein - DNA complexes which had identical mobilities but migrated faster than the wild - type OxyR - DNA complex ( Fig. 5 ) .
Both mutants also had significantly lower apparent affinities to the DNA than the wild - type protein , since a much larger amount of the protein ( about 100 - fold ) was needed to obtain a visible retarded band .
The increased mobility of the mutant protein - DNA complexes was not a function of the elevated protein concentrations needed to see binding , since the mobility of the wild - type OxyR - DNA complex was not altered by higher concentrations of wild - type protein ( data not shown ) .

Gel filtration analysis of wild - type ( wt ) OxyR and A233V , E225K , and C199S mutants .
The purified proteins were run on a Superose 12 column , and the fractions were analyzed by immunoblots .
The numbers denote the fraction numbers .
The elution positions of the peak fractions for the standard proteins gamma globulin ( 158 kDa ) , bovine serum albumin ( 67 kDa ) , and ovalbumin ( 44 kDa ) are indicated by the arrows .
served with the A233K and E225K protein - DNA complexes could be due to a difference in oligomerization , we examined the properties of the purified wild - type and A233V and E225K mutant proteins on a gel filtration column .
Previous crosslinking experiments suggested that OxyR is a dimer in solution ( 35 ) ; however , several observations about the OxyR binding sites , such as the twofold dyad symmetry of the OxyR binding motif and the contacts made by OxyR in four adjacent major grooves , suggested that OxyR may act as a tetramer ( 37 ) .
The purified wild - type , A233V , and E225K mutant proteins were loaded on a Superose 12 gel filtration column , and the fractions were analyzed by immunoblots ( Fig. 6 ) .
The wild - type protein eluted predominantly in fractions - 28 to 30 , with a peak between fractions - 28 and 29 .
Assuming a globular conformation , this elution profile could correspond to a tetramer of the 34.4 - kDa OxyR protein ( 137.6 kDa ) .
The A233V and E225K mutant proteins eluted in fractions 29 to 31 with a peak at fraction 30 , coinciding with the peak for the 67 - kDa standard protein and suggesting that the A233V and E225K proteins are dimers ( 68.8 kDa ) .
These data are consistent with the observation that the A233V and E225K mutants led to a fastermigrating protein - DNA complex in the gel - retardation assay and may bind to DNA as dimers .
Since wild - type OxyR purified in the absence of reducing agents is oxidized , we also examined the size of the wild - type protein when the sizing column was loaded and eluted in the presence of 100 mM dithiothreitol .
The elution profile observed under reducing conditions was almost identical to the profile seen in the absence of dithiothreitol ( data not shown ) .
We also examined the size of the noninducible C199S mutant , which appears to be locked in the reduced conformation ( 21 ) .
The C199S protein eluted over a greater range of fractions than the wild - type protein , but much of the protein appears to be tetrameric .
Therefore , since both oxidized and reduced wild - type OxyR can be described as tetramers and both the tetrameric wild - type protein and the dimeric E225K mutant are sensitive to oxidation , our results suggest that oxidation of the OxyR protein does not influence multimerization .
trans dominance of nonrepressing mutants .
Having observed that OxyR is oligomeric , we tested whether the nonrepressing mutant proteins exhibit a negative trans - dominant phenotype and could inhibit the activity of the wild - type protein by forming inactive heteromultimers in - vivo .
We therefore transformed the plasmids encoding the nonrepressing mutants into a wild - type oxyR strain carrying the oxyR - galK fusion ( GSO27 ) and compared the levels of galK expression with that in the original oxyR : : kan deletion ( GSO7 ) background .
As seen during the mutant screen , the vector - control strain and all of the nonrepressing mutants gave rise to red colonies in the oxyR : : kan background .
In the oxyR background , the vectorcontrol strain gave white colonies since the chromosomally encoded OxyR protein could repress the oxyR - galK fusion .
In contrast , the colonies for the R4C , T31M , L32F , S33N , and R50W mutants were red , showing that the chromosomally encoded wild - type protein could not repress the fusion in the presence of these mutants .
The colonies for the oxyR strain carrying E225K , however , were white , suggesting that the wildtype protein can still act as a repressor in the presence of this mutant .
We then assayed the levels of galactokinase activity in the oxyR and oxyR : : kan strains in a quantitative assay ( Table 3 ) .
In the oxyR : : kan deletion background , as expected , all of the mutants had levels of galactokinase activity comparable to that of the vector - control strain .
In the oxyR background , all mu - 1290 KULLIK ET AL. .
tants except E225K had elevated levels of galactokinase activity and showed a nonrepressing phenotype .
Therefore , the R4C , T31M , L32F , S33N , and R50W mutants are trans dominant and are able to `` poison '' the wild - type activity .
The wild - type protein could still repress oxyR expression in the E225K mutant strain , suggesting that no mixed , inactive multimers are formed with E225K and revealing that this mutant is not trans dominant .
This observation is consistent with our conclusion that the E225K mutation affects the multimerization of OxyR .
DISCUSSION OxyR is a specific - DNA - binding protein which is able to activate as well as repress transcription of specific target genes .
Here we used random mutagenesis to define regions of OxyR involved in DNA binding .
We screened for mutants unable to repress an oxyR - galK fusion and identified six mutants which had elevated levels of oxyR - galK expression and exhibited decreased DNA binding in mobility - shift and DNase I footprinting assays .
The decreased - binding mutants also showed increased sensitivity to oxidants and decreased expression of the OxyR - activated oxyS gene in - vivo , showing that OxyR - DNA binding is required for both activation and repression of the target genes .
The HTH motif represents a DNA binding domain of OxyR .
Five of the six mutations ( R4C , T31M , L32F , S33N , and R50W ) mapped within or near the HTH motif which is conserved among the LysR family members .
The decreased - binding phenotype of the nonrepressing mutants is consistent with the conclusion that the HTH region ( residues 6 to 66 ) corresponds to the DNA binding domain in the LysR - type proteins ( 28 ) .
The R4C , S33N , and R50W mutations in OxyR affect amino - acids that show a high degree of conservation among the LysR family members .
Since many LysR family members bind to sequences that contain the very generic T - N 11 - A motif ( 18 ) , we propose that some of the highly conserved amino - acids contact these conserved base pairs , while contacts by less highly conserved amino - acids in the HTH domain provide specificity for the individual regulators .
Future cross - linking experiments between the LysR - type proteins and the corresponding binding sites could test this hypothesis .
For OxyR , a region near the C terminus may also be critical for binding , since a protein with 22 amino - acids truncated was not able to repress OxyR expression .
A deletion of the C - terminal eight amino - acids of the NahR protein also results in a loss of DNA binding ( 29 ) .
In contrast , the MetR protein tolerates substantial C - terminal deletions ( 38 ) , suggesting that the C terminus is critical for DNA binding by only a subclass of LysR family members .
A C - terminal region of OxyR involved in tetramerization .
One mutation ( E225K ) causing the nonrepressing phenotype did not map to the HTH motif but still caused decreased DNA binding .
Since both the nonrepressing E225K mutant and the constitutively active A233V mutant led to faster - migrating protein - DNA complexes than wild - type OxyR in a gel - retardation assay , we examined the sizes of these mutant proteins on gel filtration columns .
While the oxidized wild - type OxyR protein was primarily tetrameric in solution , the E225K and A233V mutants appeared to be dimeric .
This observation indicates that the E225K and A233V mutants are defective in multimerization and that the amino - acids around positions 225 to 233 are directly or indirectly involved in tetramerization .
Consistent with this interpretation , we found that the E225K mutant , unlike the other nonrepressing mutants , was not trans dominant .
The purified E225K and A233V mutants are similar in their abilities to bind DNA and induce expression of oxyS in - vitro ( 21 ) ; however , several in - vivo characteristics of these mutants are distinct .
Both mutant proteins show weak binding in - vitro , but E225K does not repress oxyR expression in - vivo , while A233V is an efficient repressor .
The E225K protein was also only a weak activator of oxyS expression under oxidizing conditions in - vivo , while the A233V mutant was an extremely strong constitutive activator .
Since the purified A233V protein had only a weak activity in - vitro compared with its strong activation activity in - vivo , it is likely that the A233V protein is modified during purification .
Possibly some unknown conditions or factors present in intact cells act to stabilize the A233V mutant .
Our observation that the oxidized wild - type OxyR protein is a tetramer is consistent with the previous finding that the OxyR protein binds to four adjacent major grooves of the DNA helix ( 37 ) .
The twofold dyad symmetry of the OxyR binding motif ( ATAGxtxxxaxCTATxxxxxxxATAGxtxxxaxCTAT ) suggests that the tetrameric OxyR protein may exist as a dimer of dimers ( 37 ) .
This would imply the presence of two multimerization domains in OxyR , one involved in dimerization and the other required for the tetramerization of two dimers .
The E225K and A233V mutations could conceivably affect either the dimerization domain ( resulting in dimers via the tetramerization domain ) or the tetramerization domain ( resulting in dimers via the dimerization domain ) .
We can not unambiguously distinguish between these possiblities , but we propose that the two OxyR mutations affect a putative tetramerization domain , since the C terminus seems to be dispensible for dimeric but not tetrameric LysR family members .
We did not identify any mutations affecting the second multimerization domain .
Possibly these mutations lead to an unstable form of the protein , or alternatively , the mutants are still trans dominant .
The NahR , TrpI , and CysB members of the LysR family have also been shown to be tetramers in solution ( 14 , 26 , 29 ) , while other LysR proteins , such as MetR , NodD3 , and Nac , appear to be dimers ( 17 , 19 , 25 ) .
The CysB protein has also recently been shown to bind DNA as a tetramer ( 20 ) .
It is interesting that for OxyR and possibly for other tetrameric LysR family members , the C - terminal domain is critical for DNA binding and the protein binds to approximately 45 bp .
In contrast , for dimeric MetR , the C terminus seems to be dispensable for DNA binding and the protein binds to approximately 25 bp ( reference 24 and references therein ; 38 ) .
These differences suggest that there may be at least two different classes of LysR proteins , those which are able to bind and activate as dimers and others which are able to function only as tetramers .
The finding that OxyR exists as a multimer raises the possibility that the oligomerization state of OxyR might be regulated as a function of oxidation and reduction , similar to the case for the oxygen - sensitive transcriptional regulator FNR ( 23 ) .
We do not favor this mechanism for regulating the activity of OxyR , since the elution profile of wild - type OxyR under reducing conditions ( data not shown ) is identical to the elution profile of the oxidized protein .
The inactive C199S mutant , which appears to be locked in the reduced state ( 21 ) and shows a protein - DNA shift similar to that with the oxidized wild - type protein ( data not shown ) , can also be described as a tetramer .
In addition , the dimeric A233V mutant is constitutively active , and the dimeric E225K protein is still responsive to hydrogen peroxide in - vivo .
Future studies of how the OxyR subunits are arranged , how the subunit contacts are changed upon oxidation , and how many subunits need to be oxidized in order to VOL .
177 , 1995 OxyR DNA BINDING AND MULTIMERIZATION REGIONS 1291 induce transcription should give further insights into how the OxyR protein is activated by oxidation .
