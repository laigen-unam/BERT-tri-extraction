Patil a Vegetable and Fruit Improvement Center , Department of Horticultural Sciences , Texas A&M University , College Station , Texas , USA , a and Food Safety and Environmental Microbiology Program , Texas A&M University , College Station , Texas , USA b Obacunone belongs to a class of unique triterpenoids called limonoids , present in Citrus species .
Previous studies from our laboratory suggested that obacunone possesses antivirulence activity and demonstrates inhibition of cell - cell signaling in Vibrio harveyi and Escherichia coli O157 : H7 .
The present work sought to determine the effect of obacunone on the food - borne pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 by using a cDNA microarray .
Transcriptomic studies indicated that obacunone represses Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) , the maltose transporter , and the hydrogenase operon .
Furthermore , phenotypic data for the Caco - 2 infection assay and maltose utilization were in agreement with microarray data suggesting repression of SPI1 and maltose transport .
Further studies demonstrated that repression of SPI1 was plausibly mediated through hilA .
Additionally , obacunone seems to repress SPI2 under SPI2 - inducing conditions as well as in Caco - 2 infection models .
Furthermore , obacunone seems to repress hilA in an EnvZ - dependent fashion .
Altogether , the results of the study seems to suggest that obacunone exerts an antivirulence effect on S. Typhimurium and may serve as a lead compound for development of antivirulence strategies for S. Typhimurium .
Salmonella species continue to be an important health problem .
According to the FoodNet surveillance network 2009 preliminary report on infectious diseases , Salmonella species were among the leading causes of food - borne illnesses in the United States .
A total of 7,039 cases of Salmonella infection were reported in 2009 ( 8 ) .
Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium were among the 10 major serotypes identified as causative agents .
An estimated 1.4 million cases of nontyphoidal Salmonella infections occur in the United States annually , resulting in 15,000 hospitalizations and 400 deaths ( 57 ) .
This grim situation may worsen further , especially as the spread of antibiotic - resistant strains of Salmonella from various sources is being reported ( 61 ) .
In order to counter Salmonella infections , it is imperative to identify and develop strategies toward nonconventional targets .
The antivirulence approach targets the functions essential for infection rather than viability ( 9 ) .
Bacterial virulence systems such as the secretion system , quorum - sensing systems , pilus , and adhesins are some of the actively pursued nonconventional targets for development of antivirulence drugs ( 9 , 20 , 51 ) .
S. Typhimurium contains several virulence determinants , such as fimbrial/nonfimbrial adhesins , flagella , the virulence plasmid , the spv gene cluster , and Salmonella pathogenicity islands ( SPIs ) ( 46 ) .
In particular , SPI1 is required for initial attachment and subsequent internalization of the pathogen to the intestinal cells ( 2 ) .
SPI2 , on the other hand , plays an important role in intracellular survival and systemic infection ( 38 , 40 , 53 ) .
In addition , several SPI1 - encoded effectors contribute to the pathogen 's successful intracellular existence ( 5 ) .
Numerous genetic and environmental factors regulate expression of SPI1 - and SPI2 - encoded type III secretion systems ( TTSSs ) and other virulence determinants .
Furthermore , motility in Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 is regarded as an important virulence factor ( 46 ) .
Identification of an antivirulence agent which influences all or any of these virulence - factors may have preventive and therapeutic potential .
Limonoids are a unique class of secondary - metabolites present in Citrus species .
Obacunone , a limonoid ( Fig. 1 ) , is present in significant quantities as glucoside and aglycone in citrus juices and seeds ( 17 , 18 , 39 ) .
Commonly consumed citrus fruits and juices such as grapefruit and orange juice may contain up to 11 ppm obacunone ( 17 , 18 , 39 ) , while lemon seeds are a rich source of obacunone ( as much as 29 ppm ) ( 15 ) and may serve as a good source of raw material for purification purposes .
Chemically , limonoids are triterpenoids , characterized by the presence of a furan ring and a high degree of oxygenation .
In vitro and animal studies suggests that obacunone and a few other limonoids may have potential anticarcinogenic activity against certain types of cancers ( 34 , 41 , 42 , 52 ) .
Furthermore , experiments on normal cell lines and animal models ( 41 , 42 ) as well as with human volunteers suggest that limonoids may have low toxicity ( 30 ) .
A 500 - mg/kg ( of body weight ) dose of obacunone per day was well tolerated and did not have adverse effects in rats ( 52 ) , indicating a low toxicity .
Recent data from our laboratory suggest that certain limonoids may act as inhibitors of bacterial quorum - sensing and associated phenotypes such as TTSS , biofilm , and motility ( 55 , 56 ) .
Specifically , obacunone appears to interfere with autoinducer - mediated cell - cell signaling and to repress the locus of enterocyte effacement , which encodes TTSS in Escherichia coli O157 : H7 ( 56 ) , and may potentially serve as a lead compound to develop novel antivirulence agents .
We wondered if obacunone has an antivirulence effect on Salmonella .

cunone exerts an antivirulence effect on S. Typhimurium LT2 by repressing SPI1 and SPI2 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals .
Previously purified obacunone ( 56 ) was used in the current study .
Briefly , defatted powder of grapefruit seeds was extracted with acetone , concentrated under vacuum , and chromatographed on silica gel column .
Obacunone was eluted with dichloromethane - ethyl acetate ( 95 : 5 ) .
A stock solution of obacunone was prepared by dissolving 20 mg obacunone in 1 ml dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) .
Bacterial strains , plasmid , and growth - conditions .
Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Unless otherwise specified , bacterial cultures were grown in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm .
When appropriate , the medium was supplemented with 10 g of chloramphenicol or 10 g of tetracycline per ml medium .
A 1.96 - kb fragment containing the envZ gene was amplified from S. Typhimurium LT2 genomic DNA using Deep Vent DNA polymerase ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) and a primer pair presented in Table 1 .
The PCR was performed under the following conditions : initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s , annealing at 55 °C for 30 s , and extension at 72 °C for 2 min .
The last cycle was followed by a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C .
Primers were designed to create restriction sites by altering one base in the sequence .
The amplified fragment ( 1 g ) was double digested with KpnI and HindIII in NEB 2 buffer for1hatroom temperature and cloned into pBAD33 , generating plasmid pBAD envZ .
The generated plasmid was electroporated into S. Typhimurium SL1344 strain RL829 ( 37 ) .
Growth and metabolic activity .
Diluted ( 100 - fold in LB - medium ) overnight cultures of S. Typhimurium LT2 ( 200 l ) were incubated in 96 - well plates with 100 g/ml obacunone or an equivalent amount of DMSO .
Optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) was monitored for 16 h at 15 - min intervals in a Synergy HT MultiMode microplate reader ( BioTek Instruments , Winooski , VT ) .
The instrument was set to maintain 37 °C TABLE 1 Bacterial strains , plasmids , and primers used in the current study Strain , plasmid , or primer Description or sequence ( 5 = -- 3 =) Catalog no .
The viability of S. Typhimurium was measured using alamarBlue as described before ( 55 ) .
Total RNA extraction and array hybridization .
Overnight cultures of S. Typhimurium LT2 were diluted 100 - fold in LB - medium and grown to an OD 600 of 1.0 ( approximately 11 generation cycles ) at 37 °C in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone or DMSO .
The RNA was stabilized by addition of 5 volumes of RNAProtect bacterial reagent ( Qiagen Inc. , Valencia , CA ) and isolated with an RNeasy minikit ( Qiagen Inc. ) .
To remove all DNA , samples were treated with DNase I ( 30 units ) for 15 min on column , followed by elution of RNA with elution buffer .
RNA quality was analyzed with a Bioanalyser 2100 ( Agilent Technologies Inc. , Santa Clara , CA ) , and quantity was determined with an ND - 1000 spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop Technologies ; Fisher Scientific ) .
S. Typhimurium LT2 genome microarrays , version 4 , containing 5,462 open reading frames ( ORFs ) were obtained from the Pathogen Functional Genome Resource Center ( PFGRC ) , National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
The arrays were hybridized as described earlier ( 54 ) .
Briefly , 10 g total RNA from each treatment was converted to cDNA using a random primer ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 monoreactive dyes ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ ) .
The labeled cDNA was column purified ( Qiaquick PCR purification kit ; Qiagen Inc. ) , and equal quantities of labeled cDNA from obacunone - and DMSO - treated samples were used to hybridize microarrays in dye - swap fashion .
A total of 6 dye - swapped hybridizations , corresponding to three biological replicates , were conducted .
Hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C for 18 h .
The arrays were washed and scanned on a GenePix 4100A scanner ( Molecular Devices Corporation , Sunnyvale , CA ) at 532 and 635 nm .
Microarray data collection and analysis .
Signal intensities from the images were extracted using GenePix 6.0 software ( Molecular Devices Corporation ) .
The median signal intensities were normalized using LOWESS ( 43 ) by Acuity 4.0 software .
Genes differentially expressed between obacunone - and DMSO - treated samples were identified by Student 's t test .
P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini - Hochberg method ( 3 ) .
Genes with a P value of 0.01 were considered significantly differentially expressed and reported .
Quantitative reverse transcription - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) .
For validation of the microarray study , three independent total RNA samples were collected from S. Typhimurium cultures grown in LB - medium to an OD 600 of 1.0 in the presence of obacunone or DMSO .
RNA was extracted and processed under conditions similar to those for the microarray study .
Gene - specific primers ( Table 1 ) , designed with Primer 3 ( 48 ) , were used to amplify selected genes using 25 ng cDNA .
For measurement of ssrAB and spiC expression , S. Typhimurium cultures , grown to an OD 600 of 1.0 in 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) - buffered magnesium minimal - medium ( MgM ) , were used to extract RNA and for subsequent gene - specific amplification .
To determine the levels of specific genes inside Caco - 2 cells , the Caco - 2 cells ( 1 10 6 ) were infected with S. Typhimurium LT2 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 100 and incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 in a humidified chamber .
Cells were washed with Dulbecco 's phosphate - buffered saline ( DPBS ) after 2 h , and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) , for adhesion - mimicking conditions .
For invasion - mimicking conditions , initial medium was replaced with gentamicin - containing medium after 1 h and plates were further incubated for 90 min .
For all experiments , first - strand synthesis was carried out using murine leukemia virus ( MuLV ) reverse transcriptase enzyme and random hexamer ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) for 60 min at 42 °C followed by 5 min at 99 °C .
The expression levels of specific genes were quantified by amplifying 25 ng cDNA with 10 pmol primers using SYBR Green PCR mix ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) on an ABI - Prism 7000 HT ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) .
The amplifications were carried out with the following cycle parameters : one cycle of 95 °C for 10 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min .
After completion of amplification cycles , melt curve data were generated to determine the amplification quality .
The relative expression levels for obacunone / DMSO were calculated by the threshold cycle ( 2 CT ) method ( 24 ) .
The means standard deviations ( SDs ) of three biological replicates are presented .
Adhesion and gentamicin protection ( invasion ) assays .
The adhesion assay was performed as described previously ( 50 ) .
Colon adenocarcinoma epithelial Caco - 2 cells ( ATCC CCL - 228 ) were purchased from the ATCC ( Manassas , VA ) and routinely maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) .
For adhesion assay , Caco - 2 cells were plated in 6 - well plates at a density of 1 10 5 cells/well .
S. Typhimurium LT2 was grown overnight in a 25 - ml culture .
The Salmonella cells were centrifuged at 5,000 g for 10 min and resuspended in 0.9 % saline solution .
The cells were counted by dilution in 0.9 % saline solution and plating on tryptic soy agar ( TSA ) plates .
The Caco - 2 cells were infected with S. Typhimurium LT2 cells at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 , in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone or an equivalent amount of DMSO .
The plates were incubated for 3hat37 °C and 5 % CO 2 .
The excess S. Typhimurium LT2 cells were washed three times with PBS .
The Caco - 2 cells were lysed with 0.1 % Triton X - 100 solution .
The resulting lysate was then diluted using 0.9 % saline solution in 6 serial dilutions and plated on the tryptic soy agar plates .
Colonies were counted after 24 h and recorded as CFU .
The invasion assay was performed as described before ( 45 ) .
For the gentamicin protection assay , 1 10 5 Caco - 2 cells were infected with S. Typhimurium LT2 at an MOI of 10 in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone or DMSO .
One hour after infection at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 , the medium was replaced with DMEM plus 10 % FBS and 100 g/ml gentamicin to kill noninvasive cells , and incubation was continued for an additional 90 min .
After incubation , the Caco - 2 cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed with 0.1 % Triton X - 100 solution .
The CFU were enumerated by plating the appropriate dilutions in 0.9 % saline solution on TSA .
Overnight cultures of S. Typhimurium strains EE658 and RL829 were diluted ( 1:100 ) in LB - medium and grown to an OD 600 of 1.0 in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone or DMSO .
The - galactosidase assay was performed as described previously ( 26 , 35 ) .
Briefly , 1 ml cells was pelleted and resuspended in chilled Z - buffer .
A 600 for resuspended cells was recorded , and 100 l of cells was further diluted with Z - buffer and permeabilized with 0.1 % SDS and chloroform .
O - Nitrophenyl - - galactoside ( 4 mg/ml ) was added to diluted culture and incubated at room temperature .
Sodium carbonate ( 1 M ) was added to stop the reaction .
A 420 and A 550 were measured spectrophotometrically .
The Miller units were calculated using the following equation : Miller units 1,000 [ ( OD 420 1.75 OD 550 ) / ( T V OD 600 ) ] .
The data were analyzed with an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Tukey 's pairwise multiple comparison test on SPSS 16.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) .
The effect was considered significant at P 0.01 .
To test for the ability to use maltose as a carbon source , S. Typhimurium was grown on morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ( MOPS ) minimal - medium ( 36 ) .
The overnight culture was diluted 100 - fold in MOPS minimal - medium supplemented with 0.2 % maltose or glucose as the sole source of carbon , and S. Typhimurium growth was measured in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone as described under `` Growth and metabolic activity .
'' In addition , M63 medium was prepared containing2g ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ,13.6 gKH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 mg FeSO 4 · 7H 2 O , and 1 mM MgSO 4 · 7H 2 O but without Casamino Acids and vitamins .
The S. Typhimurium growth was measured in M63 medium supplemented with 0.2 % maltose or glucose in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone as described above .

7014 aem.asm.org Applied and Environmental Microbiology Antivirulence Activity of Obacunone FIG 2 Growth curve of S. Typhimurium LT2 in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone and DMSO .
RESULTS Effect of obacunone on Salmonella growth .
Growth of S. Typhimurium LT2 in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone or an equivalent amount of DMSO was measured up to 16 h. Obacunone did not seem to affect S. Typhimurium growth at the tested concentrations ( Fig. 2 ) .
The mean generation times for DMSO and obacunone treatments were 22.07 and 22.03 min , respectively .
To understand the response of S. Typhimurium LT2 to obacunone , cDNA microarrays from PF - GRC were used .
Total RNA samples prepared from three different obacunone - and DMSO - treated cultures of S. Typhimurium were converted to cDNA and labeled with Cy3/Cy5 monoreactive dyes .
Equal quantities of Cy3 - and Cy5 - labeled cDNAs from DMSO and obacunone treatments were mixed and hybridized to 6 Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 version 4 microarrays .
The arrays contain open reading frames ( ORFs ) from strain LT2 SGSC1412 including plasmid , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi CT18 , and Salmonella enterica serovar Ty2 .
The data were lowess normalized and evaluated for quality .
Student 's t test with the Benjamini - Hochberg correction was employed to determine the ORFs differentially expressed between control and obacunone treatments .
Upon exposure to 100 g/ml obacunone , a total of 175 genes ( 3.2 % ) were differentially expressed ( P 0.01 ) out of 5,462 ORFs present .
However , only 95 genes demonstrated a 2 - fold change in the expression in either direction .
Several regulons were downregulated by obacunone exposure , including Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) , the maltose regulon , and the hydrogenase 1 operon ( Table 2 ) .
Validation of microarray data by qRT - PCR .
TABLE 3 Validation of microarray - based expression profiles of selected genes by qRT - PCR Relative expression level Gene Microarray qRT - PCR hilA 8.2 8.02 ( 0.4 ) prgK 9.9 8.91 ( 0.3 ) invB 8.7 6.83 ( 0.1 ) sopE2 10.2 5.90 ( 0.5 ) hyaA 9.4 6.09 ( 0.3 ) malF 5.4 2.21 ( 0.1 ) malK 6.1 2.78 ( 0.2 ) rpoA 1.10 ( 0.1 ) the results obtained from the microarray experiment , qRT - PCR was performed on the selected genes .
Based on the interest , one gene from each affected operon was selected ( Table 1 ) .
The housekeeping gene rpoA was used as a control .
The threshold cycle ( C T ) values were normalized to levels of rrsH , and fold change was calculated by the 2 ( CT ) method ( 24 ) .
A comparison of microarray data and qRT - PCR data is presented in Table 3 .
In general , the results of qRT - PCR analysis were consistent with the microarray results .
However , the numerical values obtained from qRT - PCR differed from the values in microarray analysis .
This difference was possibly a result of the different sensitivities of the two assays and because of the fact that different biological samples were used for qRT - PCR analysis .
Regulation of SPI1 by obacunone .
A downregulation of about 19 genes of the SPI1 - carried genes by 2.4 - to 11.3 - fold ( Table 2 ) was detected using microarray analysis .
Among these was the central transcriptional regulator of SPI1 , hilA ( downregulated by 8.2 - fold ) , in response to obacunone .
Needle complex structural protein genes prgK and prgJ ( carried in the prg/org operon ) and invG were repressed by 9.9 - , 11.3 - , and 7.9 - fold , respectively .
Furthermore , export apparatus protein genes spaR and spaP were downregulated .
The iagB gene , encoding a muramidase , speculated to help in the passage of needle through the peptidoglycan layer , was also repressed ( 7.3 - fold ) .
The chaperones sicP and invB were downregulated by 9.0 - and 8.7 - fold , respectively .
In addition to the repression of SPI1 - carried genes , obacunone also downregulated the effector sopE2 , carried outside SPI1 .
It is pertinent to note that InvF/SicA , encoded in SPI1 , regulates the expression of sopE2 ( 10 ) .
The repression of SPI1 would be predicted to show defects in adhesion and invasion of epithelial cells .
To confirm the findings of the microarray experiment , the effect of obacunone on the adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cell line Caco - 2 was examined .
Caco - 2 cells were grown in DMEM and infected with S. Typhimurium LT2 in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone .
The obacunone exposure resulted in a significantly reduced number of adhesive Salmonella cells ( P 0.01 ) .
In the presence of obacunone , 4.85 log CFU Salmonella cells were recovered compared to 7.34 log CFU in DMSO treatment ( Fig. 3 ) .
Furthermore , obacunone reduced the number of Salmonella cells by 1.84 log units ( P 0.01 ) in a gentamicin protection assay ( Fig. 3 ) .
These results were consistent with the downregulation of SPI1 .
Regulation of maltose operon .
MalEFG ( 49 ) and MalK - LamB - MalM ( 44 ) constitute the ABC transport complex , which facilitates the uptake of maltose and maltodextrins ( 4 ) .
Obacunone exposure resulted in downregulation of malEFG and malK - lamB operons .
Specifically , malE and malF were downregulated by 8.8 - and 5.4 - fold , respectively .
The malK - lamB - malM genes , which are transcribed in the opposite direction from the malEFG operon , were downregulated by 6.1 - , 6.2 - , and 5.3 - fold , respectively .
Repression of the mal operon would then suggest that obacunone might impair the uptake of maltose and consequently reduce the growth - rate of S. Typhimurium on maltose .
To investigate if obacunone impairs maltose transport , growth of S. Typhimurium in the MOPS minimal - medium and M63 medium with maltose ( 0.2 % ) as sole carbon source was measured .
Glucose ( 0.2 % ) was used as a positive control .
In MOPS medium , the growth - rates of S. Typhimurium were similar for obacunone and DMSO treatments when glucose was used as a carbon source ( Fig. 4B ) .
However , suppressed growth of S. Typhimurium was observed in the presence of obacunone when maltose was used as a carbon source ( Fig. 4A ) .
These results indicate a maltose uptake impaired by obacunone , resulting in a lower growth - rate .
To more clearly discern the effect of obacunone on maltose uptake , M63 medium deprived of Casamino Acids and vitamins was prepared .
The medium was expected to be stringently limited in its resources and ability to sustain growth .
The prepared medium was supplemented with maltose or glucose ( 0.2 % in each case ) and used to study the growth pattern of S. Typhimurium .
The S. Typhimurium growth pattern showed a typical response in M63 minimal medium with glucose as a sole carbon source , where the OD 600 reached its maximum at 210 min and decreased thereafter , giving rise to a bell - shaped curve ( Fig. 4D , G NT ) .
Additionally , the growth curves were similar for obacunone , DMSO , and medium without any treatment , when glucose was used as a carbon source .
For maltose - supplemented cultures , the growth curves for medium without treatment and DMSO treatment simulated the patterns of glucose - treated cultures ( Fig. 4C ) , suggesting that in DMSO - treated cultures the bacteria exhausted the available carbon source in the first 210 min and the population faced a nutrient limitation afterwards .
In contrast , obacunone - treated cultures demonstrated a lower but steady growth - rate , indicating a reduced rate of maltose uptake , which might have prevented the early ex - FIG 3 Effect of 100 g/ml obacunone on adhesion and invasion by Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 on Caco - 2 cells .
The Caco - 2 cells ( 1 10 5 ) were seeded in six - well plates and infected with S. Typhimurium LT2 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 .
The number of S. Typhimurium cells attached to Caco - 2 cells was counted by lysing Caco - 2 cells 3 h postinfection , plating them on LB agar plates , and counting the colonies after 24 h .
The gentamicin protection assay as described in the text was used to count the number of invasive S. Typhimurium cells .
The asterisk denotes a significant difference ( P 0.01 ) from DMSO treatment .

M63 minimal - medium was prepared without Casamino Acids and vitamins and used to elucidate S. Typhimurium growth in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone using maltose ( C ) and glucose ( D ) as the sole carbon source .
The data represent the means of three biological replicates .
M , maltose ; G , glucose ; O , obacunone ; D , DMSO ; NT , no treatment .
haustion of carbon source and maintained a steady state .
Taken together , the data indicate that obacunone downregulates the mal operon and impairs the maltose uptake .
Regulation of hydrogenase operon .
The nomenclature of S. Typhimurium hydrogenases is not well established .
Therefore , the annotation assignment presented by Zbell et al. ( 59 ) was followed in the current study .
Specifically , symbols hyaABCDEF were used for the genes with locus tags STM1786 to STM1791 .
Obacunone seems to repress the entire operon hyaABCDEF by 7.9 - to 9.4 - fold ( Table 2 ) .
In addition , downregulation of hycH ( 9.7 - fold ) , which encodes the large subunit of hydrogenase 3 , was observed .
Obacunone influences hilA expression in a dose - dependent fashion .
HilA is a central regulator for genes carried in SPI1 ( 1 , 2 ) .
To determine if obacunone exerts a dose - dependent effect on hilA expression , S. Typhimurium was grown in the presence of 6.25 , 12.5 , 25 , 50 , and 100 g/ml obacunone , and hilA expression was measured using qRT - PCR .
The results of the study indicate that obacunone influences the expression of hilA in a concentrationdependent fashion ( Fig. 5 ) .
Exposure of 12.5 g/ml obacunone suppressed hilA expression by 2.34 - fold .
The lowest tested concentration , 6.25 g/ml , produced a change of 1.99 - fold .
These data indicate that obacunone at a low dose of 12.5 g/ml may be able to alter the gene expression pattern of hilA significantly and possibly also that of hilA - dependent genes .
Effect of obacunone on genes carried in SPI2 .
Expression of SPI2 is induced inside macrophages and epithelial cells , primarily when Salmonella is present in specialized phagosomes , Salmonella - containing vacuoles ( 40 , 53 ) .
SsrAB is a two - component system encoded within SPI2 which controls the expression of SPI2 genes encoding TTSS and effectors , while SpiC is an effector encoded within SPI2 ( 13 , 33 , 38 ) .
Additionally , ssrAB is transcribed in the opposite direction from spiC .
In order to understand the effect of obacunone on SPI2 , relative expression levels of ssrA , ssrB , and spiC in MES - buffered magnesium minimal - medium ( MgM ) , which was reported to stimulate SPI2 TTSS gene expression ( 11 , 13 ) , were measured .
We first measured the induction of ssrAB and spiC in MES - buffered MgM over LB - medium in S. Typhimurium grown to an OD 600 of 1.0 .
ssrA , ssrB , and spiC were induced by 7.7 - , 6.0 - , and 8.6 - fold , respectively , in MES - buffered MgM compared to LB - medium ( Fig. 6A ) .
To determine the effect of obacunone , S. Typhimurium was grown to an OD 600 of 1.0 in MESbuffered MgM in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone or DMSO .
FIG 5 Expression of hilA in the presence of different concentrations of obacunone .
Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 was grown in the presence of different concentrations of obacunone , and qRT - PCR was conducted as described in Materials and Methods .
The data are presented as means of three biological replicates SDs .
The change in gene expression was considered significant if the fold change was 2 - fold .

The cultures were grown to an OD 600 of 1.0 in the presence of obacunone or DMSO before RNA was extracted and qRT - PCR was performed .
The fold change was calculated as obacunone/DMSO .
The pH of the cultures was maintained at 7.5 and did not change during the course of investigation .
Obacunone seems to repress the expression of ssrA , ssrB , and spiC by 9.7 - , 11.8 - , and 6.8 - fold , respectively , in MES - buffered MgM ( Fig. 6B ) , while a 1.1 - fold change was recorded for rpoA .
Effect of obacunone on expression of SPI1 - and SPI2 - carried genes in Caco - 2 cells .
SPI1 and SPI2 are implicated in initial attachment , subsequent internalization , and systemic infection of S. Typhimurium in host cells .
Moreover , both SPI1 and SPI2 are reportedly induced inside the mammalian epithelial cells 2 to 4 h postinfection ( 16 ) .
We were interested in understanding if obacunone has an effect on expression of SPI1 and SPI2 under conditions mimicking the infection process .
Expression of hilA and ssrA was measured as a surrogate to understand the expression pattern of SPI1 and SPI2 .
We first determined the expression of hilA and ssrA at 2 and 2.5 h postinfection under conditions mimicking adhesion and invasion assays , respectively .
The expression levels were calculated over S. Typhimurium grown in DMEM plus 10 % FBS under the same conditions as those for S. Typhimuriuminfected Caco - 2 cells .
An induction of 3.4 - and 2.3 - fold under conditions mimicking adhesion at 2 h was observed in ssrA and hilA expression , respectively ( Fig. 7A ) , whereas , under conditions mimicking invasion at 2.5 h , ssrA and hilA were upregulated by 7.4 - and 3.3 - fold , respectively ( Fig. 7B ) .
The effect of obacunone on SPI1 and SPI2 was then determined under adhesion - and invasion - mimicking conditions at 2 and 2.5 h. Exposure of obacunone resulted in repression of hilA and ssrA by 2.55 - and 3.16 - fold at 2h ( Fig. 7C ) and by 3.9 - and 4.4 - fold at 2.5 h ( Fig. 7D ) , respectively .
Obacunone represses hilA expression in an envZ - dependent manner .
Several environmental and genetic factors regulate expression of SPI1 , SPI2 , and mal operons ; however , EnvZ - OmpR is reported to directly regulate the three operons ( 7 , 22 , 27 ) .
To determine the role of EnvZ - OmpR , hilA chromosomal fusion reporter strains EE658 and RL829 ( 2 , 26 ) ( kindly provided by C. A. Lee , Department of Biology , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , MA ) were employed .
First , the expression of hilA : : Tn5lacZ in a chromosomal fusion reporter in S. Typhimurium SL1344 strain EE658 in response to obacunone and DMSO was measured .
Obacunone repressed the expression of hilA080 : : Tn5lacZ by 3 - fold ( P 0.001 ) ( Fig. 8A ) .
To determine the role of EnvZ - OmpR in obacunone - mediated repression of hilA , S. Typhimurium SL1344 strain RL829 ( 26 , 27 ) was used .
Strain RL829 has a disruption in envZ and is defective in envZ - mediated induction of hilA .
Obacunone did not affect ( fold change , 0.92 ) the expression of hilA ( P 0.05 ) in an envZ mutant background ( Fig. 8B ) .
To further verify , envZ was cloned in plasmid pBAD33 FIG 7 ( A ) Expression of SPI1 - and SPI2 - carried hilA and ssrA under adhesion - mimicking conditions .
To determine the expression , Caco - 2 cells were infected with S. Typhimurium at a multiplicity of infection of 100 .
Total RNA was isolated 2 h postinfection using TRIzol , and qRT - PCR was performed to determine the relative expression of hilA and ssrA compared to that in S. Typhimurium grown in DMEM plus 10 % FBS used to culture Caco - 2 cells .
( B ) Expression of hilA and ssrA under invasion - mimicking conditions ( 2.5 h after infection ) .
The infected Caco - 2 cells were treated with 100 g/ml gentamicin by replacing the medium after 1 h. RNA was extracted from cells after 2.5 h from the beginning of the experiment .
The fold change was calculated over S. Typhimurium culture grown in DMEM plus 10 % FBS .
( C and D ) Expression of hilA and ssrA under adhesion - mimicking conditions similar to those in panel A ( C ) and invasion - mimicking conditions similar to those in panel B ( D ) .

The fold change was calculated as obacunone / DMSO .

Obacunone repressed the expression of hilA080 : : Tn5lacZ by 2.42 - fold ( P 0.01 ) under experimental conditions ( Fig. 8C ) , whereas no difference was observed in obacunone - and DMSO - treated RL829 containing only vector .
Additionally , envZ expression in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone calculated over DMSO was 1.5 ( 0.4 ) - fold ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION Citrus fruits are consumed very widely in the United States and worldwide .
According to the Economic Research Service , USDA ( 12 ) , the per capita consumption of total citrus fruits and juices has varied between 84 and 114 lb ( fresh weight equivalent ) since the year 2000 .
Furthermore , citrus is a significant contributor and a rich source of dietary phytochemicals such as flavonoids and limonoids ( 29 ) .
Obacunone is an important constituent of citrus fruits and juices and likely to be consumed in significant quantities .
Since our previous studies demonstrated that obacunone potentially inhibits enterohemorrhagic E. coli ( EHEC ) virulence ( 56 ) , we were further interested in its effect on S. Typhimurium , another important intestinal pathogen .
As with EHEC , obacunone did not affect the growth of S. Typhimurium .
To elucidate the effect of obacunone , the gene expression profile of S. Typhimurium in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone was studied using cDNA microarrays .
A concentration of 100 g/ml obacunone was used based on our previous studies , to obtain a measurable response in S. Typhimurium ( 55 , 56 ) .
Obacunone exposure resulted in repression of three distinct functional systems , SPI1 , the hydrogenase operon , and the maltose transport system .
HilA is the transcriptional regulator of SPI1 and is regulated by a variety of genetic and environmental factors ( 1 , 2 , 27 ) .
In particular , HilA regulates the expression of inv , prg/org , and spa operons in SPI1 ( 25 ) .
Obacunone repressed hilA as well as hilA - dependent genes carried in prg/org , inv , and spa operons .
In addition , the effector sopE2 , which is carried outside SPI1 but regulated by SPI1 - encoded InvF/SicA ( 10 ) , was repressed .
Furthermore , independent measurement of selected genes confirmed the general results obtained from microarray studies ( Table 3 ) .
Previously , we have demonstrated that a citrus flavonoid , naringenin , also has an antivirulence effect on S. Typhimurium LT2 by repressing SPI1 ( 54 ) .
However , the modes of action of naringenin and obacunone seem to be different .
For instance , naringenin seems to repress SPI1 in a HilD - dependent manner , represses the flagellar operon , and induces the RND efflux pump , whereas obacunone seems to repress SPI1 in an envZ - dependent manner ( discussed below ) and does not seem to affect flagella or the RND efflux system .
The different modes of action may likely arise from the fact that obacunone and naringenin belong to two different chemical classes and differ very widely in terms of structure .
The SPI1 - encoded needle complex is essential for initial attachment and entry of the pathogen into the host cells ( 46 ) , whereas SPI2 - encoded effectors are required for intracellular survival ( 5 ) .
Repression of various operons inside SPI1 indicated two possibilities : ( i ) impaired assembly of needle complex and export apparatus will result in reduced adhesion and invasion of animal cells and ( ii ) repression of SPI1 by obacunone is mediated through hilA .
The hilA repression by obacunone was dose dependent ( Fig. 6 ) , suggesting that the repression of SPI1 by obacunone is mediated through hilA .
To determine that obacunone treatment may reduce the attachment and subsequent internalization of S. Typhimurium , Caco - 2 cell models of adhesion and invasion were employed .
Consistent with the observed hilA and SPI1 repression , obacunone significantly reduced the number of S. Typhimurium cells adhering to and internalized in Caco - 2 cells ( Fig. 3 ) .
Furthermore , obacunone did not affect the viability of Caco - 2 cells during the time period used for the assay ( 41 ; also unpublished data ) .
The second system affected by obacunone was the maltose transporter .
The maltose transporter facilitates the uptake and efficient catabolism of maltose and maltodextrins ( 4 ) .
In E. coli O157 : H7 ( EHEC ) , maltose metabolism was demonstrated to be necessary to initiate infection in a mixed culture model ( 19 ) .
To demonstrate the effect on the maltose transporter , maltose utilization assays were conducted under two different medium conditions .
The MOPS medium is well defined in composition , and growth is dependent upon the supply of carbon source .
Additionally , MOPS medium provides buffering action , thereby eliminating differences due to pH. The M63 minimal - medium that was prepared contained only the salts but no energy source except the added sugar ( glucose or maltose at 0.2 % ) ; therefore , growth was solely dependent upon carbon source and was very restricted for a short time .
Obacunone repressed the maltose transporter , suggesting a reduced uptake of maltose and maltodextrin .
Furthermore , a suppressed growth - rate of S. Typhimurium indicated impaired maltose utilization , plausibly due to repressed transporter .

FIG 9 Speculative model of action of obacunone on S. Typhimurium LT2 .
Obacunone seems to repress hilA and possibly SPI1 in an EnvZ - dependent fashion ( solid line ) .
Additionally , obacunone is speculated to repress ssrAB ( SPI2 ) and the mal operon in an EnvZ - dependent manner ( dashed line ) .
The mode of action of obacunone on EnvZ/OmpR is unknown .
Altogether , the data suggest that obacunone exposure resulted in a reduced rate of maltose uptake , which may be attributed to downregulation of the maltose transporter .
The third system repressed by obacunone was hydrogenase .
Salmonella contains three hydrogenase enzymes ( 28 ) , which are important for cellular metabolism .
Although the E. coli hya operon , a homologue of S. Typhimurium LT2 hyaABCDEF , was reported to be transcribed as a polycistronic message ( 32 ) , the polycistronic nature of the S. Typhimurium hya operon is not established .
Repression of the entire hya operon by obacunone indicates a possibility that S. Typhimurium hya is also coded as a polycistronic message .
However , this hypothesis needs further experimental work to be established .
The enzyme Hyc together with formate dehydrogenase oxidizes formate to produce CO 2 and H 2 ( 47 ) during fermentative growth of bacteria .
The majority of H 2 produced by Hyc is recycled by the enzyme Hya ( 60 ) .
Obacunone exposure affected the genes carried in the hydrogenase 1 ( hya ) operon and resulted in repression of the entire hya operon and hycH of the hyc operon .
Although the overall hydrogen uptake activity was reported to be higher under rich - medium and aerobic conditions such as LB medium ( 28 ) , regulation of hydrogenases appears to be complex and not well understood .
Additionally , we did not observe any differences in pH due to obacunone during the experiments , ruling out any regulation due to pH. Therefore , at this point the significance of hydrogenase regulation by obacunone is unclear .
Furthermore , hydrogenases seem to play a role in S. Typhimurium virulence ( 28 ) , which might have an additive effect with reduced virulence due to repression of SPI1 and SPI2 and requires further study .
The reduced number of S. Typhimurium cells recovered from epithelial cells indicated a possibility that obacunone might affect the expression or function of the SPI2 - encoded TTSS in addition to observed repression of SPI1 .
SPI2 was reported to be induced in MES - buffered MgM .
Therefore , S. Typhimurium was grown in MES - buffered MgM in the presence of 100 g/ml obacunone and relative changes in expression of ssrA , ssrB , and spiC were measured using qRT - PCR .
The results suggested that obacunone repressed the expression of ssrA , ssrB , and spiC , suggesting regulation of SPI2 .
We were further interested in determination of the effect of obacunone on the expression of SPI1 and SPI2 under adhesion and invasive model conditions .
Both SPI1 and SPI2 are essential for S. Typhimurium pathogenicity .
SPI1 is induced during early invasion stages , whereas SPI2 gets induced during late stages of S. Typhimurium infection ( 40 , 53 ) .
Obacunone exposure resulted in repression of hilA and ssrA measured under adhesion and invasive conditions , suggesting that obacunone may affect S. Typhimurium virulence under these model conditions .
Furthermore , it is possible that obacunone may demonstrate antivirulence potential under in - vivo conditions .
Global regulators EnvZ/OmpR , BarA/SirA , and CsrA in S. Typhimurium regulate SPI1 and the mal regulon ( 7 , 22 , 27 ) .
In addition , ompR was reported to regulate the SsrA - SsrB two - component system encoded in SPI2 ( 23 ) .
CsrA is a posttranscriptional regulator and therefore was ruled out of the current study ( 22 ) .
SirA is reported to activate SPI1 and SPI2 in a growth - phasedependent fashion , i.e. , at late stationary - phase ( 10 h ) in LB - medium ( 6 , 31 ) , by inducing CsrB and CsrC , which counteract the repressive effect of CsrA .
Theoretically , repression of SirA is not likely to enhance the repressive effect of CsrA .
Moreover , the relevance of SirA for SPI2 regulation under in - vivo conditions is currently unknown .
Therefore , SirA was not further studied .
Since EnvZ/OmpR is the two - component system which regulates SPI1 , SPI2 , and the maltose regulon at early to late stationary phase and in epithelial cell culture models , similarly to conditions used in our studies , EnvZ/OmpR was a possible candidate under tested experimental conditions .
If obacunone alters hilA expression by modulating EnvZ/OmpR , the differential expression of hilA would be abrogated in the absence of EnvZ/OmpR .
The dependence of hilA regulation on EnvZ was tested by measuring the expression of hilA in an EnvZ mutant background .
S. Typhimurium strain RL829 is arabinose insensitive , contains chromosomal fusion hilA080 : : Tn5lacZY , and carries a mutation in envZ ( 26 ) .
The levels of - galactosidase activity were similar in DMSO - and obacunone - treated samples .
Additionally , restoration of the repressive effect of obacunone upon expression of envZ from the plasmid in RL829 suggested that the repression of hilA by obacunone is mediated via EnvZ .
Altogether , the data seem to suggest that obacunone represses at least SPI1 and possibly SPI2 and the mal regulon in an EnvZ - dependent fashion ( Fig. 9 ) .
In the present study , involvement of BarA/SirA was not investigated ; therefore , a possible role of this two - component system in obacunone activity could not be ruled out at present and needs further investigation .
S. Typhimurium strain LT2 carries a mutation in the rpoS allele and is less virulent than strains carrying the wild - type allele .
Furthermore , rpoS is shown to regulate spvABCD and spvR genes , which are essential for systemic infection but do not affect the ability of S. Typhimurium to infect epithelial cells in tissue culture ( 58 ) .
Additionally , rpoS does not seem to activate hilA ( 21 ) .
Our results indicate that obacunone did not affect the spv gene cluster but repressed hilA ; therefore , the antivirulence activity of obacunone may not depend on ropS .
In a nutshell , obacunone exposure repressed SPI1 and SPI2 , which resulted in reduced numbers of S. Typhimurium cells attached to and internalized in Caco - 2 cells .
Furthermore , the presented data seem to suggest that obacunone exerts its action in an EnvZ - dependent fashion .
However , EnvZ also regulates the expression of porins encoded by ompC and ompF .
One possible scenario is that obacunone is transported inside the cell through porins OmpC and OmpF and that the actual target is different than EnvZ/OmpR .
Another possibility is that obacunone regulates SPI1 and SPI2 in a SirA/BarA - dependent fashion .
These possibilities require further investigation and will be helpful in deducing the mode of action of obacunone .
Additionally , structure - function studies are needed to determine the structural features responsible for antivirulence activity .
Furthermore , it is also possible that obacunone may affect expression of additional Salmonella pathogenicity islands .
Such a possibility requires further investigation .
We previously reported that obacunone represses 7020 aem.asm.org Applied and Environmental Microbiology Antivirulence Activity of Obacunone TTSS in E. coli O157 : H7 ( 56 ) ; it is possible that obacunone represses E. coli O157 : H7 TTSS in a fashion similar to that for S. Typhimurium .
In conclusion , the data suggest that obacunone exerts an antivirulence effect on S. Typhimurium and may serve as a lead compound in development of antivirulence strategies to counter S. Typhimurium infection .
