All field isolates harbored a single gyrA mutation ( D87Y ) .
Deletion of acrB and complementation with wild - type gyrA increased quinolone susceptibility .
Selection for ciprofloxacin resistance was associated with the development of an additional gyrA ( S83F ) mutation in 104 - cip , novel gyrB ( E466D ) and parE ( V461G ) mutations in 5408 - cip , overexpression of acrB and decreased susceptibility to nonquinolone - antibiotics in both mutants , and decreased OmpF production and altered lipopolysaccharide in 104 - cip .
Complementation of mutated gyrA and gyrB with wild - type alleles restored susceptibility to quinolones in 104 - cip and significantly decreased the ciprofloxacin MIC in 5408 - cip .
Complementation of parE had no effect on quinolone MICs .
Deletion of acrB restored susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics tested .
Both soxS and marA were overexpressed in 104 - cip , and ramA was overexpressed in 5408 - cip .
Inactivation of each of these global regulators lowered ciprofloxacin MICs , decreased expression of acrB , and restored susceptibility to other antibiotics .
Mutations were found in soxR ( R20H ) and in soxS ( E52K ) in 104 - cip and in ramR ( G25A ) in 5408 - cip .
In conclusion , both efflux activity and a single gyrA mutation contribute to nalidixic - acid resistance and reduced ciprofloxacin sensitivity .
Ciprofloxacin resistance and decreased susceptibility to multiple antibiotics can result from different genetic events leading to development of target gene mutations , increased efflux activity resulting from differential expression of global regulators associated with mutations in their regulatory genes , and possible altered membrane permeability .

Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is the most common etiological agent of food - borne salmonellosis worldwide .
Ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of severe Salmonella infections when therapeutic intervention is warranted .
To date , fluoroquinolone resistance ( MIC of ciprofloxacin , 4 g/ml ) remains relatively uncommon in Salmonella .
However , the incidence of nalidixic - acid resistance in Salmonella isolates from humans and food animals has increased , with these isolates showing decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones ( 6 , 27 ) .
Of paramount concern to public health are reports of therapeutic failure of ciprofloxacin in cases of invasive salmonellosis associated with isolates displaying reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility ( 26 , 30 , 48 ) .
Currently well - recognized mechanisms of quinolone resistance in Salmonella include target gene mutations , increased efflux pump activity , and plasmid - mediated protection of target topoisomerases ( 13 , 18 ) .
The contribution of changes in the cell envelope , including porin loss or alterations of the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , to quinolone resistance is currently unclear ( 14 , 29 , 36 ) .
Nalidixic acid resistance and decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin have been largely associated with single gyrA mutations at codon S83 or D87 ( 7 , 18 , 36 ) .
Double mutations at both residues 83 and 87 have been found in fluoroquinolone - resistant strains , often in association with mutations in other topoisomerase genes ( 3 , 4 , 7 ) .
Overexpression of the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB - TolC has been shown to directly contribute to fluoroquinolone and multidrug resistance ( MDR ) in Salmonella ( 3 -- 5 ) .
Much of our knowledge on the regulation of expression of AcrAB comes from work carried out in Escherichia coli ( 34 ) .
At a local level acrAB expression is modulated by the local repressor AcrR , and at a global level it is modulated by MarA , SoxS , and Rob , which belong to the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators ( 2 ) .
In addition to activating tolC and acrAB genes , these transcriptional activators activate transcription of micF , an antisense RNA that inhibits synthesis of the OmpF outer membrane porin ( 34 ) .
Mutations within the local repressor AcrR have also been shown to contribute to acrB overexpression ( 33 ) .
The mar locus consists of two transcription units , marC and marRAB , which are divergently transcribed from a central putative operator - promoter region , marO ( 10 , 45 ) .
MarA regulates its own transcription as well as regulating the expression of the mar regulon , whereas MarR 1080 VOL .

acts by repressing marRAB transcription .
The functions of MarB and MarC are unknown .
marRAB transcription can also be activated by the MarA homologs SoxS and Rob ( 2 , 10 , 45 ) .
SoxS is the effector of the soxRS global superoxide response regulon .
SoxR is a constitutively expressed homodimeric transcriptional regulator that contains redox - active iron - sulfur clusters [ 2Fe - 2S ] .
Oxidation of these clusters activates SoxR to trigger transcription of the soxS gene ( 22 , 50 ) .
Increased expression of these global regulators may be associated with mutations in the regulatory genes of the operons ( 20 , 21 , 32 ) or the selective binding of inducers ( 38 , 39 ) .
As in E. coli , increased expression of marA and soxS has been associated with fluoroquinolone resistance and MDR in Salmonella ( 7 , 12 ) .
However , the contribution of these global regulators to overexpression of acrAB in fluoroquinolone resistance and MDR Salmonella phenotypes is still currently unclear .
Furthermore , little is known about rob and its contribution to antibiotic resistance in Salmonella .
More recently , RamA , which displays close homology to MarA and is absent from E. coli , has been implicated in MDR in Salmonella and other bacteria ( 1 , 16 , 19 , 42 ) .
Overexpression of ramA has been associated with increased expression of acrB in Salmonella and other Enterobacteriaceae ( 1 , 19 , 42 ) .
In this study we examined the mechanisms of quinolone resistance in nalidixic - acid - resistant serovar Enteritidis field isolates showing decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin .
We generated in - vitro ciprofloxacin - resistant mutants from two of these isolates in order to assess the contribution of target gene mutations , altered membrane permeability , and active efflux to the development of fluoroquinolone resistance and MDR .
The role of the global regulators marA , soxS , rob , and ramA in upregulation of acrB and consequently in efflux - mediated MDR was investigated .
Local and global regulatory genes of AcrAB - TolC were examined for the presence of mutations .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains .
Nine serovar Enteritidis strains of animal ( 54 , 58 , 51 , and 104 ) and human ( CUH48 , CUH52 , CUH60 , 4931 , and 5408 ) origin were used in this study ( Table 1 ) .
The serovar Enteritidis reference strain PT4 NCTC 13349 was also included .
Ciprofloxacin - resistant mutants ( 104 - cip and 5408 - cip ) were selected from serovar Enteritidis strains 104 and 5408 .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium knockout strains L110 acrB : : aph , L130 marA : : aph , L133 ramA : : aph , and L135 soxS : : aph derived from SL1344 ( 12 , 41 ) and donor E. coli strains carrying the plasmids pBP513 gyrA , pBP548 gyrB , and pBP568 parE were also used and kindly provided to L. Piddock by P. Heisig ( 15 ) .
Selection of ciprofloxacin - resistant Salmonella mutants in - vitro .
Ciprofloxacin - resistant mutants ( 104 - cip and 5408 - cip ) were obtained by seven serial passages on tryptone soy agar ( Oxoid , Hampshire , United Kingdom ) containing doubling concentrations of ciprofloxacin ( 0.25 to 16 g/ml ; Sigma - Aldrich , Ireland ) .
Colonies from the highest - concentration selecting plates were subcultured five times on antibiotic - free medium before antibiotic sensitivities were determined .
Mutants were stored on beads in cryopreservation fluid at 80 °C ( Technical Service Consultants Ltd. , Lancashire , England ) .
MICs of nalidixic - acid , ciprofloxacin , ampicillin , chloramphenicol , tetracycline , and sulfamethoxazole - trimethoprim were determined by Etest on Mueller - Hinton agar following the manufacturer 's instructions ( AB - Biodisk , Solna , Sweden ) and according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI ) ( 9 ) .
E. coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were used as quality control organisms .
To assess the contribution of efflux pump activity to intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance , Etests were performed in the presence and absence of the efflux pump 1082 O'REGAN ET AL. .

PCR amplification and sequencing of QRDRs of quinolone target genes and local and global regulators of AcrAB - TolC .
Sequences of the primers used in the PCR amplifications are given in Table 2 .
Genomic DNA was extracted from overnight cultures in tryptone soy broth ( Oxoid ) at 37 °C using a Wizard genomic DNA purification kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
PCR mixtures contained 100 ng of template DNA , 100 pmol of each quinolone resistance - determining region ( QRDR ) primer or 10 pmol of each regulator primer ( MWG - Biotech AG , Ebersberg , Germany ) , 200 M deoxynucleoside triphosphates ( Promega ) , 1 U Taq DNA polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) , and 1 PCR buffer containing 2.5 mM MgCl 2 .
After an initial denaturation step of 3 min at 94 °C , amplification was performed over 30 cycles , with each cycle consisting of 1 min at 94 °C , 1 min at appropriate annealing temperature ( Table 2 ) , and 1 min at 72 °C , with a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C .
PCR products were purified with the Qiaquick spin PCR purification kit ( Qiagen , West Sussex , United Kingdom ) and sequenced commercially ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) .
Sequence analysis was carried out online using the programs BLAST ( http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ ) , CLUSTALW ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools / clustalw2/index.html ) , and Transeq ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/transeq/ ) .
Ciprofloxacin accumulation was measured by a fluorometric method described by Mortimer and Piddock ( 31 ) .
Accumulation experiments were performed with and without the addition of efflux pump inhibitor PA N ( final concentration , 80 g/ml ) 6 min after the addition of ciprofloxacin ( final concentration , 10 g/ml ) .
Fluorescence was measured with a spectrofluorimeter ( spectraMax Gemini ; Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 279 and 447 nm , respectively .
The amount of ciprofloxacin accumulated was calculated by comparison with a standard curve for ciprofloxacin ( 0.02 to 2.5 g/ml ) in 0.1 M glycine hydrochloride ( pH 3.0 ) .
Results are expressed as nanograms of ciprofloxacin incorporated per milligram ( dry weight ) of bacteria .
All experiments were performed at least three times to ensure reproducibility .
Expression analyses of efflux transporter gene acrB and global regulators .
Reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) was used to assess gene expression of acrB and global regulators soxS , marA , ramA , and rob .
Overnight cultures were diluted 1 in 100 in prewarmed LB broth and grown to mid - logarithmic phase VOL .
53 , 2009 QUINOLONE AND MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE IN SALMONELLA 1083 ( optical density at 600 nm [ OD 600 ] , 0.6 ) with shaking at 37 °C .
A 1 - ml aliquot of each culture was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,339 g for 10 min , and RNA was extracted immediately using a RiboPure - Yeast ( Ambion , Texas ) kit .
Contaminating genomic DNA was eliminated by two DNase I treatments according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Ambion ) , and its absence was confirmed by including a reverse transcriptase - minus control on each RNA sample .
Total RNA concentration was estimated by OD 260 using a Nanodrop ND - 1000 spectrophotometer ( Thermoscientific , Delaware ) .
Real - time quantification of RNA templates by real - time One - Step RT - PCR was performed in a Rotor Gene 3000 thermocycler ( Corbett Research , Sydney , Australia ) using a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT - PCR kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) .
The RT - PCR was carried out in a 25 - l reaction mixture containing 12.5 l 2 QuantiTect SYBR Green RT - PCR Master Mix , 10 pmol of each primer ( Table 2 ) , 5 ng of purified RNA template , and 0.25 l of QuantiTect RT mix .
Initial reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min was followed by a denaturation step of 15 min at 95 °C .
Amplification was then performed over 35 cycles , with each cycle consisting of 15 s at 94 °C , 30 s at appropriate annealing temperature ( Table 2 ) , and 30 s at 72 °C , with a final melting step .
Within bacterial cells , the level of 16S rRNA was assumed to be transcribed at a constant rate throughout the growth - conditions in this study .
Relative gene expression was calculated using the threshold cycle method ( 24 ) .
Ciprofloxacin - sensitive parents and ciprofloxacin - resistant mutants were examined for cellular phenotypes using Omnilog phenotype microarrays ( PM11 - 20 ) ( Biolog , Inc. , Hayward , CA ) .
Briefly , bacteria were grown on blood agar overnight at 37 °C .
Colonies were picked with a sterile cotton swab and suspended in 10 ml IF - 0a ( Biolog ) , and the cell density was adjusted to an OD 600 of 0.035 on a spectrophotometer ( Biomate 5 ; Thermospectronic , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) .
A 750 - l aliquot of this cell suspension was added to 150 ml IF - 10 ( Biolog ) .
Microtiter plates were inoculated with 100 l of cell suspension per well , incubated at 37 °C for 48 h in the Omnilog , and monitored continuously for color changes in the wells .
Kinetic data were analyzed with Omnilog PM software .
The relevance of target gene mutations in 104 - cip and 5408 - cip was evaluated by complementation assays .
Plasmids containing the wild - type alleles were introduced into the mutant cells by electrotransformation , and transformants were selected on LB agar supplemented with 50 g/ml kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C overnight .
Quinolone MICs of transformants were compared to those of parent and mutant strains using Etest strips .
Gene deletions ( acrB , marA , soxS , and ramA ) from SL1344 mutants were transduced into bacterial isolates by using P22 phage according to standard procedures .
The resulting deletional mutants were selected on LB agar containing 50 g/ml kanamycin , and insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene into mutants was confirmed by PCR using primers listed in Table 2 .
Analysis of LPS : cell lysis and proteinase K digestion .
LPS was isolated by proteinase K treatment of bacterial cells as described by Hitchcock and Brown ( 17 ) .
LPS preparations were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a 4 % ( wt/vol ) stacking gel and a 15 % ( wt/vol ) separating gel .
LPS from Salmonella enterica serotype Minnesota ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used as a smooth LPS control .
A full - range rainbow molecular weight marker was used as the size standard ( Amersham , England ) .
Following electrophoresis , the LPS was visualized by silver staining as previously described by Tsai and Frasch ( 47 ) .
SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses and immunocharacterization .
Exponential - phase bacteria in LB broth were pelleted and solubilized in boiling buffer at 96 °C as previously described ( 25 ) .
Equal amounts of total cell protein ( OD 600 0.01 ) were loaded onto an SDS - polyacrylamide gel ( 10 % polyacrylamide , 0.1 % SDS ) .
Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R - 250 ( 0.25 % [ wt/vol ] ) .
For Western blots , proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer ( 25 ) .
An initial saturating step was performed overnight at 4 °C with Tris - buffered sodium ( TBS ; 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8.0 ] , 150 mM NaCl ) containing skim milk powder ( 10 % ) .
The nitrocellulose sheets were then incubated in TBS containing skim milk powder ( 10 % ) and Triton X - 100 ( 0.2 % ) for 2hatroom temperature in the presence of polyclonal antibodies ( 1:2,000 dilution ) directed against denatured OmpF porin or with F4 polyclonal antibody directed against the L3 internal loop of E. coli porins ( 11 ) .
These antibodies directed against denatured OmpF and the L3 internal porin loop recognized the denatured enterobacterial porins including Salmonella F and D porins ( 44 ) .
The detection of antigen - antibody complexes was performed with alkaline phosphatase - conjugated AffinitiPure goat anti - rabbit immunoglobulin G antibodies as previously reported ( 25 ) .

Values in parentheses are disk diffusion results in the presence of efflux pump inhibitor PA N at80 g/ml .
Values represent means of three separate determinations .
Two field isolates ( CUH48 and CUH52 ) and the reference strain ( NCTC 13349 ) were fully susceptible to nalidixic - acid ( MICs , 8 g/ml ) and ciprofloxacin ( MICs , 0.023 g/ml ) .
Seven strains showing high - level nalidixic - acid resistance ( MIC , 256 g/ml ) displayed decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ( MICs between 0.125 and 0.19 g/ml ) .
The ciprofloxacin - selected mutants , 104 - cip and 5408 - cip , displayed high - level quinolone resistance ( nalidixic acid MICs , 256 g/ml ; ciprofloxacin MICs , 32 g/ml ) .
Additionally , 104 - cip showed decreased susceptibility to tetracycline , ampicillin , and chloramphenicol and 5408 - cip showed decreased susceptibility to sulfamethoxazole - trimethoprim , ampicillin , and chloramphenicol ( Table 3 ) .
Phenotype microarray analysis showed that 104 - cip tested resistant to 36 antimicrobials including beta - lactams , narrow - and expandedspectrum cephalosporins , chloramphenicol , tetracycline , fungicides , and biocides .
Similarly , 5408 - cip tested resistant to 23 antimicrobials , including beta - lactams , narrow - and expandedspectrum cephalosporins , chloramphenicol , folate synthesis inhibitors , macrolides , aminoglycosides , and chelators ( data not shown ) .
Contribution of target gene mutations to quinolone resistance .
Fully quinolone - susceptible strains had no mutations in the target genes ( Table 1 ) .
A single gyrA mutation ( D87Y ) was present in all strains showing high - level nalidixic - acid resistance .
Complementation of gyrA in both 104 and 5408 reduced nalidixic - acid MICs to 4 g/ml in both isolates and decreased ciprofloxacin MICs to 0.047 g/ml and 0.032 g/ml , respectively .
In 104 - cip an additional mutation in gyrA ( S83F ) was associated with the development of high - level ciprofloxacin resistance .
In 5408 - cip novel mutations were detected in gyrB ( E466D ) and parE ( V461G ) ( Table 1 ) .
Complementation of gyrA in 104 - cip ( S83F , D87Y ) restored susceptibility to nalidixic acid ( MIC , 8 g/ml ) and ciprofloxacin ( MIC , 0.094 g / ml ) .
Complementation of gyrA and gyrB in 5408 - cip reduced ciprofloxacin MICs to 1 and 3 g/ml , respectively .
Complementation of parE in 5408 - cip had no effect on quinolone MICs ( Table 1 ) .
Accumulation of ciprofloxacin in in - vitro - selected ciprofloxacin - resistant serovar Enteritidis isolates ( 104 - cip and 5408 - cip ) and their isogenic parent strains ( 104 and 5408 ) in the presence and absence of PA N ( 80 g/ml ) .
Ciprofloxacin ( 10 g/ml ) was added to each bacterial suspension at time zero .
PA N was added at 6 min as indicated by the arrow .
Each value represents the mean standard error of the mean of three or four separate experiments .
Contribution of efflux pump activity to antibiotic resistance .
The contribution of efflux pump activity to antibiotic resistance was assessed by use of the efflux pump inhibitor PA N. PA N decreased the MIC of nalidixic - acid and ciprofloxacin in all wild - type strains ( Table 1 ) .
It decreased the MIC of ciprofloxacin in 104 - cip to 2 g/ml but had no effect on the MIC of nalidixic - acid .
The MICs of both nalidixic - acid and ciprofloxacin in 5408 - cip were reduced to 16 g/ml and 2 g/ml , respectively , in the presence of PA N ( Table 1 ) .
The susceptibility of ciprofloxacin - resistant mutants to other antibiotics was also restored in the presence of PA N ( Table 3 ) .
Both mutants accumulated less ciprofloxacin than did their isogenic parents ( Fig. 1 ) .
Addition of PA N increased ciprofloxacin accumulation in both mutants and parents , the two eventually reaching identical steady - state levels of cell - associated ciprofloxacin .
Contribution of AcrAB - TolC to antibiotic resistance .
104 - cip and 5408 - cip showed increased expression of acrB ( 6.1 - 1.5 - and 5.4 - 1.6 - fold increases , respectively ) .
Deletion of acrB decreased the MIC of ciprofloxacin from 32 to 0.38 g/ml in 104 - cip and from 32 to 0.5 g/ml in 5408 - cip and had no effect on the MICs of nalidixic - acid ( Table 1 ) .
Susceptibility to other classes of antibiotics was also restored in both deletional mutants ( Table 3 ) .
Deletion of acrB also decreased the MICs of ciprofloxacin and nalidixic - acid in isolates ( 51 , CUH60 , 4931 , 104 , and 5408 ) showing nalidixic - acid resistance and decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin ( Table 1 ) .
Contribution of global regulators to antibiotic resistance .
In 104 - cip there was a 26.1 - 4.0 - fold increase in soxS expression and an 8.9 - 0.6 - fold increase in marA expression .
Deletion of soxS in 104 - cip decreased the expression of acrB by 4.2 - 1.0 - fold and the expression of marA by 0.6 - 1.6 - fold and decreased the ciprofloxacin MIC to 1.5 g/ml ( Table 1 ) .
Deletion of marA in 104 - cip decreased the expression of acrB by 1.4 - 0.3 - fold and the expression of soxS by 1.4 - 0.2 - fold and decreased the ciprofloxacin MIC to 4 g/ml .
Both marA and soxS deletional mutants remained nalidixic - acid resistant ( 256 g/ml ) but lost their MDR phenotype ( Table 3 ) .
In 5408 - cip there was significantly increased expression of ramA ( 33.7 - 4.0 - fold ) .
Deletion of ramA in 5408 - cip reduced acrB expression by 1.6 - 0.1 - fold and decreased the MIC of ciprofloxacin to 4 g/ml .
It had no effect on the MIC of nalidixic acid ( 256 g/ml ) ( Table 1 ) .
The ramA deletional mutant became susceptible to other classes of antibiotics ( Table 3 ) .
Expression of rob was found to be decreased in both mutants ( Table 1 ) .
Genetic analysis of local and global regulators .
Mutations were found in soxR ( R20H ) and in soxS ( E52K ) in 104 - cip .
The soxR mutation mapped to the helix - turn - helix region of the SoxR protein .
A mutation was also found in ramR ( G25A ) in 5408 - cip , which is found upstream of ramA .
No mutations were found in the local regulator acrR or the global regulators marORAB and ramA .
Porin expression and LPS profiles .
Immunodetection of OmpF with polyclonal antibodies directed against the denatured OmpF porin and with an F4 polyclonal antibody directed against the L3 internal loop of E. coli porins revealed a decrease in the production of OmpF in 104 - cip ( Fig. 2 ) .
All isolates displayed a smooth LPS phenotype .
The LPS profile of 104 - cip showed significant loss of short and intermediate O - chain LPSs compared to its isogenic parent ( data not shown ) .
No changes were observed in the LPS or OmpF profile of 5408 - cip .
The detection of porins was carried out using the polyclonal antibodies directed against denatured OmpF porin ( A ) or the F4 polyclonal antibody directed against the L3 internal loop of E. coli porins ( B ) .

53 , 2009 QUINOLONE AND MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE IN SALMONELLA 1085 DISCUSSION In this study , we confirmed that both AcrAB - TolC efflux pump activity and a D87 mutation in gyrA contribute to quinolone resistance in serovar Enteritidis field isolates displaying high - level nalidixic - acid resistance and decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones ( 7 ) .
Ciprofloxacin - resistant and MDR mutants were readily selected in - vitro from two of these field isolates , highlighting the ease with which resistance to fluoroquinolones and other clinically important antibiotics could potentially emerge during prolonged fluoroquinolone therapy in infected patients .
Selection for high - level ciprofloxacin resistance was associated with the development of an additional gyrA mutation in 104 - cip and hitherto - undocumented mutations in gyrB and parE in 5408 - cip , overexpression of acrB and the development of an MDR phenotype in both isolates , and a decrease in OmpF expression and altered LPS in 104 - cip .
Double mutations in gyrA have been widely reported in ciprofloxacin - resistant Salmonella isolates , whereas mutations in gyrB and parE in Salmonella are rarely detected ( 18 ) .
By complementation , we defined a significant role for the double gyrA mutations ( D87Y and S83F ) in quinolone resistance in 104 - cip and for the single gyrA ( D87Y ) and the novel gyrB ( E466D ) mutation in ciprofloxacin resistance in 5408 - cip .
Although complementation with wild - type parE was without effect , the possibility that parE mutations may indirectly contribute to high - level fluoroquinolone resistance by increasing the level of resistance in isolates already harboring target gene mutations can not be excluded ( 23 ) .
Consistent with increased expression of an RND multidrug efflux pump , both mutants displayed an MDR phenotype .
The increase in acrB expression was reflected in the decrease observed in ciprofloxacin accumulation , which increased following addition of PA N. Inactivation of acrB restored susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and other nonquinolone - antibiotics tested in accordance with previous reports that overexpression of AcrAB - TolC contributes to fluoroquinolone resistance and MDR in Salmonella ( 3 -- 5 ) .
Similar effects were observed with PA N , highlighting its utility as a pharmacological tool to screen for efflux - mediated antibiotic resistance in Salmonella .
Interestingly , we observed a reproducible discrepancy between the effects of PA N and deletion of acrB on nalidixic - acid resistance in 5408 - cip .
The possibility of the contribution of an unidentified efflux pump , sensitive to PA N , to nalidixic - acid resistance in this isolate can not be excluded .
The increased expression of acrB was associated with differential expression of global regulators , with 104 - cip showing increased expression of both soxS and marA and 5408 - cip showing increased expression of ramA .
By deleting each of these regulators , we provided direct evidence for their involvement in fluoroquinolone resistance and MDR in serovar Enteritidis through acrB activation .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first report to document a direct contribution of marA and soxS to AcrAB - mediated MDR in Salmonella .
Compared to the marA deletional mutant , the soxS deletional mutant showed greater downregulation of acrB and displayed lower MICs of ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics tested .
These data suggest that soxS plays a greater role than marA in MDR in 104 - cip .
Expression of marA decreased following deletion of soxS and vice versa , highlighting the cross - regulation that exists between these transcriptional factors ( 12 , 43 ) .
Recently , ramA has been reported to contribute to fluoroquinolone resistance and MDR in serovar Typhimurium through activation of acrB ( 1 ) .
Similarly our data clearly define a regulatory role for ramA in AcrAB - mediated MDR in serovar Enteritidis and furthermore show that ramA activates the MDR cascade independently of marA .
As overexpression of rob has been shown to confer MDR in E. coli through activation of acrB ( 46 ) , it is reasonable to assume a lack of involvement of this regulator in the development of MDR in this study .
The decreased expression of rob in 104 - cip is likely due to downregulation by soxS and marA ( 28 , 43 ) .
The nature and extent of the cross talk between ramA and other global regulators are currently unknown .
However , based on our data it would be interesting to speculate that it may downregulate both soxS and rob .
Increased expression of soxS and marA in E. coli has been attributed to mutations in the soxR gene that render soxR active independent of oxidative - stress or mutations in marR that alleviate its repression of marA ( 21 , 32 , 49 ) .
To date , there is only one report documenting the contribution of a mutation in soxR to increased soxS expression and MDR in Salmonella ( 20 ) .
We identified mutations in both soxR and soxS in 104 - cip .
The same soxR mutation has been linked to increased soxS expression and multiple antibiotic resistance in E. coli ( 21 ) .
Mutations in soxS have been reported in E. coli isolates overexpressing soxS , but their significance was not determined ( 49 ) .
Similar to other studies of Salmonella ( 7 , 12 ) , we found no mutations in the marR or marO region that could explain the increased expression of marA .
Therefore , it most likely resulted from feed - forward activation by SoxS .
Sequence analysis also revealed a hitherto - unreported mutation within the recently defined local repressor ramR ( G25A ) of ramA in 5408 - cip .
Mutations in ramR have been reported to play a role in upregulation of ramA and AcrAB and consequently the effluxmediated MDR phenotype in serovar Typhimurium ( 1 ) .
The significance of these mutations in soxR , soxS , and ramR is currently being investigated .
OmpF expression was decreased in 104 - cip , consistent with the role of marRAB and soxRS in the control of its expression ( 37 , 40 ) .
This mutant also displayed alterations in the LPS ladder .
In contrast to the findings in Enterobacter aerogenes and E. coli ( 8 ) , ramA - mediated MDR in 5408 - cip was not associated with downregulation of porins .
Few studies have investigated OmpF expression in fluoroquinolone - resistant Salmonella , and its contribution to resistance is unclear ( 14 , 29 , 35 ) .
Only one study to date has documented alterations in the LPS profile in fluoroquinolone - resistant Salmonella , and the authors suggested that the increase in the proportion of long O - chain LPSs observed could result in a lower level of antibiotic accessibility to the porins ( 14 ) .
Further studies are warranted to evaluate the exact contribution of altered porin expression and LPS to antibiotic resistance in 104 - cip .
Nonetheless , based on our data showing that both 104 - cip and its isogenic parent accumulated the same amount of ciprofloxacin at steady state following the addition of PA N , it would appear that the decreased accumulation of ciprofloxacin observed in 104 - cip was mainly due to enhanced efflux activity rather than decreased influx resulting from altered membrane permeability .
Furthermore , the hypersusceptibility to ampicillin , tetracycline , and chloramphenicol ( which also enter through the porin 1086 O'REGAN ET AL. .
pathway ) observed following deletion of acrB also suggests that active efflux is the main mechanism associated with MDR in this isolate .
Finally , this study revealed that different mechanisms were involved in the development of MDR following ciprofloxacin exposure , as the two mutants displayed different phenotypes of resistance to nonquinolone - antibiotics .
It is possible that these differences may be due to pleiotropic effects associated with the different expression profiles of global regulators observed in these isolates .
In summary , this study highlights that a high - level ciprofloxacin resistance and MDR phenotype in serovar Enteritidis can result from different genetic events associated with multiple resistance mechanisms .
It provides direct evidence that quinolone resistance and MDR in serovar Enteritidis result from interplay between target gene mutations and increased AcrAB - TolC efflux activity and defines a role for a novel gyrB mutation in ciprofloxacin resistance .
Increased AcrAB - TolC efflux activity in fluoroquinolone - resistant and MDR isolates can be due to differential expression of the global regulators soxS , marA , and ramA associated with mutations in their regulatory genes .
