BELDEN , AND SAMUEL I. MILLER § * Infectious Disease Unit , Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02114 The PhoP/PhoQ two - component system regulates Salmonella typhimurium genes that are essential to bacterial virulence and survival within macrophages .
The best characterized of these PhoP - activated genes ( pag ) is pagC , which encodes a 188 - amino - acid envelope protein ( W. S. Pulkkinen and S. I. Miller , J. Bacteriol .
We here report the identification of four genes ( pagD , envE , msgA , and envF ) located 5 to pagC .
Each gene is transcribed from its own promoter , two of which ( msgA and pagD ) were defined by primer extension analysis .
Three of these genes ( pagD , envE , and envF ) are predicted to encode envelope proteins .
The pagD gene is transcribed in a direction opposite from that of and adjacent to pagC and is positively regulated by PhoP/PhoQ .
Transposon insertions within pagD and msgA attenuate bacterial virulence and survival within macrophages ; however , deletion of pagD has no effect on virulence .
The product of the envF gene is predicted to be a lipoprotein on the basis of the presence of a consensus lipid attachment site .
The low G C content of these genes and the homology of msgA to Shigella plasmid DNA suggest that this region may have been acquired by horizontal transmission .

Recent work with several bacterial virulence systems has demonstrated that virulence - factors are coordinately regulated in response to environmental signals ( 27 , 30 ) .
One such regulon promotes Salmonella typhimurium virulence and is controlled by the PhoP/PhoQ proteins ( 32 ) .
PhoP is a member of the OmpR subclass of transcriptional activators , and PhoQ is similar to other sensor histidine kinases , such as EnvZ , that have a periplasmic domain ( 32 ) .
PhoP and PhoQ both positively and negatively regulate more than 40 gene products that include virulence - factors ( 33 ) .
PhoP - activated genes ( pag ) function to promote mouse virulence , survival within macrophages , and resistance to low pH and cationic antimicrobial proteins ( 31 ) .
pag transcription is maximally induced within acidified macrophage phagosomes but not after endocytosis by epithelial cells , demonstrating that PhoQ responds to specific signals present within macrophage phagosomes ( 1 ) .
Several loci that require PhoP and PhoQ for expression , including phoN , which encodes a periplasmic acid phosphatase , and 16 other PhoP - activated loci arbitrarily designated pagA - pagP have been defined ( 3 , 21 , 32 ) .
Strains with transposon insertions in pagC , pagD , pagJ , pagK , and pagM have a defect in survival within macrophages as well as a dramatic increase in the mouse 50 % lethal dose ( LD 50 ) ( 3 ) .
pagC is a 188 - aminoacid protein that is a member of a family of bacterial outer membrane proteins that are known to be or may be involved in virulence ( 38 ) .
In many bacteria , virulence genes are located on plasmids or mobile genetic elements or are clustered on the chromosome .
Major examples of this genetic organization include the cholera toxin genetic element ( 26 , 44 ) , the Listeria monocytogenes prfA region ( 37 ) , and plasmids of Yersinia species ( 9 ) and Shigella species ( 25 ) .
In S. typhimurium , a set of genes located on a 60 - MDa plasmid promote mouse virulence ( 15 ) .
In addition , multiple genes necessary to induce uptake by epithelial cells are clustered on the chromosome at 58 to 60 min ( 23 ) and are similar to plasmid - encoded Shigella and Yersinia virulence genes ( 12 , 13 , 35 ) .
Since there are several known examples of clustered bacterial virulence genes and previous work indicated that pagD was highly linked to pagC ( 3 ) , we undertook the present study to examine the pagC region and to determine if genes linked to pagC encode products that promote virulence and survival within macrophages .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and media .
All Salmonella strains are derivatives of ATCC 14028 .
Bacterial strains and plasmids are described in Table 1 .
Luria - Bertani broth was used as rich bacterial growth medium .
Antibiotics were added to Luria - Bertani broth or agar in the following concentrations ( in micrograms per milliliter ) : ampicillin , 100 ; chloramphenicol , 25 ; and kanamycin , 45 .
Chemicals were analytical grade or better from Sigma Chemical Co. ( St. Louis , Mo. ) .
Transposon - encoded gene fusion activity was assayed by using 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3 - indolyl - - D - galactoside ( X - Gal ) ( Bethesda Research Laboratories , Gaithersburg , Md. ) or 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl phosphate ( XP ) ( Amresco , Solon , Ohio ) that was added to plates at a final concentration of 40 g/ml .
Alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) ( 28 ) and - galactosidase ( 29 ) assays were performed as previously described and are reported in units as defined by Miller ( 29 ) .
DNA sequencing and analysis .
Double - stranded templates were sequenced by the dideoxy - sequencing method ( 40 ) using the Sequenase kit ( U.S. Biochemicals , Cleveland , Ohio ) .
Sequencing reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 6 % polyacrylamide -- 8 M urea gels in an Owl Scientific sequencing apparatus ( Cambridge , Mass. ) .
Computer analysis of the DNA sequence was accomplished with the GENEPRO ( Riverside Scientific , Riverside , Calif. ) and Wisconsin package ( Genetics Computer Group ) programs .
Mutagenesis of ATCC 14028 with TnphoA was performed by using the broad - host - range plasmids pRK290 and pPH1JI as previously described ( 43 ) .
Strains with AP activity were screened for chromosomal linkage of TnphoA to the Tn10 16 17 of strain AK3233 , which is 75 % linked to the pagC gene .
Plasmid mutagenesis was accomplished by using MudJ ( 18 ) or TnphoA ( 24 ) .
Plasmid pWPL17 was mutagenized with TnphoA as previously described ( 16 ) or with MudJ by growth at the permissive temperature for transposition in strain HT10288 ( 32 ) .

plasmid copy of the gene containing a MudJ insertion was accomplished in three steps .
A P22 phage lysate containing the mutagenized plasmid was transduced into a polA mutant of strain ATCC 14028 , and homologous recombination events were identified by selection for the plasmid - encoded ampicillin resistance .
Marker exchange events were subsequently identified by screening for loss of ampicillin resistance and maintenance of MudJ - encoded kanamycin resistance .
Replacement of the wild - type copy of the gene with the copy containing the MudJ insertion was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization .
Bacteriophage P22HTint - mediated transduction was performed as described by Davis et al. ( 10 ) .
Inactivation of envF was accomplished by the following .
A 550 - bp region internal to the envF coding sequence was PCR amplified and cloned into the suicide vector pGP704 .
The resulting plasmid clone , pGP67 , was mated into strain CS019 , and transconjugates were selected by the vector antibiotic resistance .
The insertion of pGP67 into the envF gene was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization .
Construction of a pagD deletion .
Plasmid clone pMG11 , containing pagD on a 1.4 - kb PstI fragment , was used as a template for PCR amplification .
Two products corresponding to the DNA upstream and downstream of pagD were amplified with the 20 forward primer and primer JG25 ( 5 CCGCTCGAGGAAC GTCATTGAC 3 ) orthe 48 reverse primer and primer JG26 ( 5 CCGCTCG AGAACATAATGTTATTTATC 3 ) , respectively .
These PCR products were digested with XhoI ( included at the 5 end of primers JG25 and JG26 ) , ligated , 5042 GUNN ET AL. .

and then digested with XbaI and SphI ( located in the DNA corresponding to the vector multiple cloning site at the end of either PCR fragment ) .
This DNA was then ligated to the sucrose selection vector pCVD442 , transformed into strain SM10 Pir , and mated into wild - type Salmonella strains .
Cells that had deleted the vector were selected on low - salt , 10 % sucrose plates ( 4 ) .
The incorporation of the deletion into the chromosome was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization .
Southern and Northern ( RNA ) blot analysis .
Chromosomal DNA was isolated by the method described by Mekalanos et al. ( 26 ) .
DNA was digested , size fractionated in agarose gels , and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes ( Dupont , Boston , Mass. ) by the manufacturer 's protocol .
High - stringency hybridization ( 65 C ) and detection of hybridization were accomplished with the Genius kit ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , Ind. ) .
All steps followed the manufacturer 's protocol , except that the antibody conjugate was diluted 1:10,000 and 1 % dry milk was used as the blocking agent .
Northern analysis was accomplished by using radioactive 32 P - labeled probes as previously described ( 35 ) .
RNA was isolated from Salmonella strains by the hot - phenol procedure ( 7 ) .
Primers ( 0.2 pmol ) end labeled with [ - 32 P ] ATP were annealed to S. typhimurium RNA ( 10 g ) and extended with reverse transcriptase .
Reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 8 M urea -- 6 % polyacrylamide gels adjacent to sequencing reactions initiated with the primers used for cDNA synthesis .
Bacterial survival within macrophages .
Stationary - phase bacteria were opsonized for 30 min in 10 % normal mouse serum .
Opsonized bacteria were added at a ratio of 10:1 ( bacteria - cells ) to bone marrow - derived macrophages harvested from male BALB/c mice ( 5 ) .
Gentamicin ( 8 g/ml ) was added to macrophage culture medium 30 min postinfection to kill extracellular bacteria .
The numbers of surviving organisms were determined at 1 , 4 , and 24 h after the addition of gentamicin .
Assays were done in triplicate on three separate occasions .
Dilutions of stationary - phase cultures were injected intraperitoneally into 35 - day - old ( 16 - to 18 - g ) female BALB/c mice ( Charles River Park Laboratories , Wilmington , Mass. ) .
Experiments strictly adhered to the guidelines of the animal care committee of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School .
LD 50 s were determined by the method described by Reed and Muench ( 39 ) .
A minimum of 10 mice at three different dilutions were tested for each strain examined .
Nucleotide sequence accession number .
The DNA sequence presented has been deposited in GenBank and assigned accession number U31849 .
RESULTS Identification of transcriptional units linked to pagC .
Previous analysis of pagC indicated that transcription likely terminated immediately after the coding sequence ( 38 ) .
In addition , DNA sequence analysis of approximately 1 kb 3 to this potential terminator did not reveal open reading frames that were likely to encode a protein product .
This suggested that no transcriptional units were located in the region immediately downstream of pagC .
Therefore , our initial effort to identify linked virulence genes was targeted to the DNA upstream of pagC .
To help identify new loci upstream of pagC , E. coli carrying plasmid pWPL17 containing 2.8 kb of DNA 5 to pagC ( Table 1 and Fig. 1 ) was mutagenized with the transposons MudJ and TnphoA , and strains with AP or - galactosidase activity were identified on chromogenic substrates .
Several strains that contained plasmids with active MudJ - or TnphoA - generated gene fusions were identified .
In addition , previous work demonstrated that a PhoP - activated gene , designated pagD , had a linkage to the Tn10 16 17 of strain AK3233 that was similar to that of pagC ( 3 ) .
By the same screening method , another strain was identified that contained an active chromosomal TnphoA insertion closely linked to pagC .
These two strains with chromosomal TnphoA insertions and the plasmids containing transposon insertions that were generated in this study were further characterized .
Physical maps of the restriction endonuclease sites surrounding the transposon insertions in strains with active plasmid or chromosomal lacZ and phoA gene fusions were made to determine the relationship of the transposon insertions to pagC ( data not shown ) .
This analysis revealed that several regions of the DNA were transcribed in a direction opposite to that of pagC ( Fig. 1 ) .
Genes linked to pagC encode four novel proteins .
To further analyze the genes defined by transposon insertions , the DNA sequence of this region was determined ( Fig. 2 ) .
DNA containing this region was previously cloned in plasmid pWP061 ( 38 ) .
By using various subclones of pWP061 and oligonucleotide primers , 4 kb of DNA was sequenced between the HpaI site 737 bp upstream of the start codon of pagC to a ClaI site far upstream .
The DNA sequences of the fusion junctions of all TnphoA and MudJ gene fusions were also determined , which produced important information pertaining to the correct reading frames .
The DNA sequence data revealed four open reading frames ( ORFs ) predicted to be transcribed and translated on the basis of the data derived from the TnphoA and MudJ insertions .
All ORFs revealed typical ribosome binding sites 6 to 11 bases from the predicted start of translation ( 41 ) .
The ORF immediately upstream and transcribed in a direction opposite to that of pagC is predicted to encode a short envelope protein of 87 amino - acids ( unprocessed ) .
This ORF contains the transposon generated gene fusion previously shown to be PhoP regulated ( pagD ) .
It is followed by a second ORF ( envE ) predicted to encode an envelope protein of 178 amino acids ( unprocessed ) .
This ORF is followed by a structure that could function as a Rho - independent transcriptional terminator ( Fig. 2 ) .
The third ORF ( later called msgA for macrophage survival gene ) is predicted to encode a small protein similar in size to that of the first gene product ( 79 amino - acids ) and is also followed by a structure that could function as a Rhoindependent transcriptional terminator ( Fig. 2 ) .
The DNA sequence predicts that this protein is composed of several charged residues with a large number of negatively charged amino - acids residing at the carboxy terminus .
We did not identify any TnphoA insertions within this gene , and the predicted protein product does not contain a structure resembling a signal sequence at its amino terminus or any hydrophobic stretches ; therefore , the third ORF is unlikely to encode an envelope protein .
The final ORF ( envF ) is predicted to encode an envelope protein of 278 amino - acids ( unprocessed ) .
A computer search of known protein motifs revealed that EnvF is predicted to contain a consensus prokaryotic membrane lipid attachment site and , therefore , is likely to be a lipoprotein ( see Fig. 2 for consensus site location ) .
The predicted proteins produced by pagD , envE , and envF contain a typical bacterial signal sequence structure ( 45 ) .
In addition , hydrophobic profiles confirmed the hydrophobic nature of the amino termini of these proteins ( data not shown ) .
The EnvE and EnvF proteins also contain hydrophobic stretches that could function as membrane spanning domains ( 22 ) .
The G C contents of the genes in this region are as follows : pagC , 43.4 % ; pagD , 42.1 % ; envE , 45.9 % ; msgA , 46.8 % ; VOL .

and envF , 40.5 % , which is considerably lower than the average G C content of S. typhimurium ( 52 % ) .
A complete search of the database with the predicted protein sequences of these four ORFs showed no significant similarities .
Strains containing three distinct TnphoA insertions and one MudJ insertion , each located in one of the four genes , were chosen for further characterization .
pagD , which is divergently transcribed from pagC , is positively regulated by PhoP/PhoQ .
Representative strains with transposon insertions were examined to evaluate whether genes transcribed oppositely to pagC were increased in synthesis in the presence of PhoP .
To accurately determine if these genes were PhoP regulated , it was necessary to recombine plasmid insertions onto the Salmonella chromosome .
Upon replacement of the wild - type gene with the gene containing the transposon insertion , P22HTint lysates made on these strains were transduced into a strain from which PhoP had been deleted ( PhoP ) and AP or - galactosidase levels were monitored .
One of these gene fusions ( pagD ) , which was also previously examined ( 3 ) , demonstrated a significant increase in AP activity between PhoP and wild - type backgrounds , while the other insertions showed no PhoP regulation ( Table 2 ) .
The representative transposon insertion in envF was unable to be recombined onto the chromosome , likely because of an insufficient amount of homologous DNA downstream of the transposon .
In order to examine the possibility of PhoP regulation of the envF gene , a region upstream of this gene through and including the phoA gene of the TnphoA transposon was cloned from plasmid pCAA9 as a 3 - kb PvuI ( blunt - ended ) - XhoI fragment into the EcoRV - SalI sites of the suicide vector pGP704 ( 34 ) .
The XhoI site is located within the transposon 3 to the phoA gene .
This clone , pGPP2 , was mated into Salmonella strain CS019 , and ampicillin - resistant recombinants 5044 GUNN ET AL. .

were selected ( creating a strain designated envF : : pGPP2 ) .
A phoP105 : : Tn10d - Tet mutation was transduced into this strain to create an isogenic pair differing only in the ability to produce a functional PhoP protein .
As shown in Table 2 , the introduction of the phoP105 : : Tn10d - Tet had no effect on the AP levels of these two strains , demonstrating that envF is not a PhoPactivated gene .
Assays of virulence and survival within macrophages of strains with insertions in or deletions of pagD , envE , msgA , and envF .
Since transposon insertions in pagC significantly increase the LD 50 of S. typhimurium in BALB/c mice , strains containing transposon insertions linked to pagC were evaluated for attenuation of mouse virulence .
As can be seen in Table 1 , while the transposon insertion in envE nor disruption of envF by the insertion of a suicide vector into the coding region ( see Materials and Methods ) had an affect on strain virulence , a TnphoA insertion in pagD and the MudJ insertion 1.8 kb downstream in msgA attenuate S. typhimurium virulence by greater than 300 - fold , compared with wild - type organisms ( LD 50 20 organisms ) .
This suggested that these two loci are essential to Salmonella mouse virulence .
S. typhimurium virulence in mice has been correlated with the ability of the organism to survive within host macrophages ( 11 ) .
To examine the survival capabilities of strains having a virulence defect , S. typhimurium cells containing insertions in either pagD or msgA were used to infect bone marrow - derived macrophages .
The results , which are shown in Table 1 , demonstrate a macrophage survival defect for these two strains .
The survival defect is greater for the pagD insertion ( macrophage survival index [ MSI ] 0.002 ) than that for the msgA insertion ( MSI 0.01 ) , and both defects are equal to or greater than that of the PhoP strain ( MSI 0.01 ) .
Since it has previously been observed that TnphoA insertions can cause virulence defects that are not related to the gene inactivated by the transposon , we created a strain deleted specifically for the pagD gene ( nucleotides 40 to 346 ) .
Upon assaying of this strain for virulence , it was found to have an LD 50 and an MSI comparable to those of wild - type Salmonella strains ( Table 1 ) .
To determine if the virulence defect of the pagD : : TnphoA strain could be the result of an obvious abnormality in protein secretion caused by the fusion protein , whole cell and membrane protein profiles of the pagD : : TnphoA strain were compared with those of wild - type Salmonella strains .
Both protein profiles were shown to be similar to those of wild - type Salmonella strains , demonstrating that the virulence defect of the pagD : : TnphoA strain does not appear to be due to a gross defect in normal protein traffic ( data not shown ) .
To demonstrate that the virulence and macrophage survival defects of msgA were not due to a polar effect of the MudJ insertion on envF transcription , a strain with a gene fusion to envF was constructed .
Plasmid pGPP2 ( described above ) was recombined into the msgA : : MudJ strain , and the AP activity of this strain was compared with that of CS019 containing the recombined pGPP2 .
These data ( shown in Table 2 ) demonstrate that the transcription of the envF gene is unaffected by the msgA : : MudJ insertion and that the gene is transcribed from its own promoter .
These results were further corroborated by Northern blot analysis .
An envF - specific PCR fragment was used to probe blots containing wild - type and msgA : : MudJ strain RNA .
Identical patterns of hybridization with equal intensities were seen between the two samples , again demonstrating that the msgA : : MudJ insertion has no effect on downstream envF transcription ( data not shown ) .
In addition , as mentioned above , the inactivation of envF does not attenuate bacterial virulence , as does the MudJ insertion in msgA .
Determination of the msgA and pagD transcriptional start sites .
To define the probable transcriptional start sites of msgA and pagD , various oligonucleotides complementary to the 5 end of each ORF or upstream region were used in a primer extension analysis .
The results depicted in Fig. 4 show that the pagD transcript begins 39 bases upstream of the translational start .
The predicted 10 ( TTCCAT ) and 35 ( TTGAAT ) regions are similar to the known consensus sequences for Escherichia coli promoters ( 17 ) .
The pagD transcript is detected in PhoP c Salmonella RNA and not in RNA from PhoP Salmonella strains ( Fig. 3A , lanes 1 and 2 ) .
The msgA transcriptional start begins 58 bases upstream of the translational start and contains predicted 10 ( CAAAAC ) and 35 ( TTACGT ) sequences .
These regions do not conform well to consensus 10 and 35 sequences ; however , the cDNA from this transcript was easily detected in equal amounts by using various primers in primer - extensions of both PhoP c and PhoP RNA .
Distribution of pagD and msgA genes in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in two low - G C - content organisms .
The G C content of the pagC chromosomal region is much lower than the average G C content of Salmonella strains .
The gene encoding the PhoP - regulated acid phosphatase of S. typhimurium ( phoN ) also has a low G C content ( 39 % ) , and DNA homologous to phoN was found only in two low - G C - content organisms of several genera tested ( 14 ) .
Therefore , we examined the DNAs of several members of the Enterobacteriaceae and two low - G C - content organisms by blot hybridization for similarity to pagD and msgA .
PCR fragments highly specific to each ORF were labeled and used as probes .
Similar to results seen with a pagC - specific probe hybridization to the pagD probe was seen only in Salmonella species at both high and low stringency ( Fig. 4A ) .
However , with an msgA - specific probe , hybridization was seen at high stringency to all Salmonella species examined as well as to Shigella sonnei , Shigella flexneri , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Citrobacter freundii ( Fig. 4B ) .
No hybridization was seen to the low - G C - content organisms Morganella morganii or Providencia stuartii .
Since several virulence genes are known to be located on the 230 - kb plasmid of Shigella species , we examined if the Shigella DNA that hybridized to the msgA probe was localized to this plasmid .
S. flexneri DNA was isolated from a strain with ( 2457T ) and a strain without ( BS103 ) the 230 - kb virulence plasmid , electrophoresed , blotted , and probed with the msgA probe .
Hybridization was observed in identical patterns regardless of the strain from which the DNA was isolated ( Fig. 5 ) .
Hybridization to plasmid DNA isolated from strain 2457T in patterns identical to those with the chromosomal digests was also observed .
The hybridizing bands can be correlated to the bands seen in the ethidium bromide - stained agarose gel .
This indicated that the DNA homologous to the VOL .

DISCUSSION We have identified four genes upstream and transcribed in a direction opposite to that of the pagC gene of S. typhimurium .
Three genes ( pagD , envE , and envF ) are predicted to be envelope proteins on the basis of the isolation of active TnphoA insertions in these loci and the presence of a typical signal sequence at the amino - terminus of each protein .
None of the four proteins possesses significant homology to any protein in the database .
Transposon - encoded reporter gene activity was examined in wild - type and PhoP backgrounds for each of the four genes .
Only the gene immediately upstream and transcribed in a direction opposite to that of pagC ( pagD ) was determined to be PhoP regulated .
Transposon insertions in this gene greatly attenuate virulence and the ability of the organism to survive within murine macrophages ; however , deletion of this gene has no effect on the LD 50 of infected mice .
There are several possible explanations for this result .
One possibility is that abnormal insertion of the fusion protein into the membrane altered the appropriate cellular location of another virulence factor .
Profiles of whole - cell and membrane proteins are similar to that of wild type ; therefore , there is no evidence that a major defect in protein secretion exists in the pagD : : TnphoA strain .
Another possible explanation for the observed result is that PagD function is redundant ; therefore , its deletion would not have an effect on virulence .
There are other examples of bacterial genes with redundant functions that are important to pathogenesis .
For example , two Listeria phospholipase genes have a small effect and no effect on the LD 50 alone .
However , a combination of the two mutations has a major synergistic effect on the LD 50 ( 36a ) .

Molecular size markers are in kilobases .
insertions that affect virulence appear to encode proteins of less than 90 amino - acids ( 2a ) .
It is possible that these pag have similar functions and that the pagD : : TnphoA fusion protein has a dominant effect on the proper cellular localizations of these proteins or on the interaction of these proteins with other macromolecules .
Analysis of strains carrying single - copy pagD promoter - reporter gene fusions has demonstrated this gene to be transcriptionally activated within cultured macrophages ( 15a ) , suggesting that this gene product has a function when bacteria are within acidified macrophage phagosomes .
This result suggests that pagD could be involved in promoting S. typhimurium survival within macrophages .
Transposon insertions in the msgA gene also were found to have an effect on mouse virulence and macrophage survival .
The MudJ insertion in msgA does not result in the formation of a fusion protein ; thus , it is unlikely that the virulence pheno - 5046 GUNN ET AL. .

In lane 4 , the high - molecularweight DNA that does not hybridize to the probe contains the virulence plasmid , while the smaller - molecular - weight plasmid DNA ( major bands seen at 2.4 and 3.5 kb ) does hybridize to the msgA probe .
types associated with this strain are due to factors other than the disruption of msgA .
MsgA , like PagD , is predicted to be a small protein .
However , in contrast to PagD , MsgA is not likely to be an envelope protein on the basis of the absence of a structure resembling a signal sequence and the fact that no TnphoA insertions were identified in the msgA coding sequence .
Transposon insertions can affect the transcription of downstream , cotranscribed genes ; however , several lines of evidence suggest that the genes described here do not form an operon .
Because none of the genes downstream of pagD is PhoP regulated , they are not transcribed from the pagD promoter .
The presence of a potential transcriptional terminator at the end of the envE gene makes it unlikely that msgA is cotranscribed with envE .
The data presented here also demonstrated that the msgA : : MudJ insertion is not polar on envF , which makes it highly likely that envF has its own promoter .
Additionally , a potential transcriptional terminator following msgA as well as a 493 - bp intergenic region makes it unlikely that these genes are cotranscribed .
The other two genes examined in this study , envE and envF , are predicted to produce membrane proteins that contain potential membrane - spanning regions .
The envF gene product is likely to be a lipoprotein on the basis of the presence of a consensus lipid attachment site .
Since several known or predicted prokaryotic lipoproteins such as the Neisseria gonorrhoeae H. 8 gene product ( 6 ) , the TraT product of the E. coli F factor ( 36 ) , the E. coli nlpD gene product ( 19 ) , and the S. typhimurium prgH and prgK genes ( 35 ) have been associated with serum sensitivity or virulence , we examined the possibility that EnvF plays a role in Salmonella virulence .
Inactivation of this gene has no affect on strain virulence ; therefore , it is unlikely that EnvF is a major contributor to Salmonella pathogenicity .
Since bacterial genomic DNA G C content is related to its phylogeny ( 42 ) , the low G C contents of the genes in the pagC region suggest that they may have been acquired by horizontal transmission .
Horizontal or lateral transfer has been suggested as a mode of acquisition of several low - G C - content genes in Salmonella species ( 14 ) .
Southern blot analysis of low - G Ccontent organisms probed with the msgA or pagD gene showed no homology ; however , this does not eliminate the possibility that they were acquired from a low - G C - content organism other than those tested .
The possibility also exists that these genes reside on a mobile genetic element acquired from another source .
The finding that a region of DNA homologous to msgA exists on one of several cryptic plasmids known to exist in Shigella species ( 20 ) suggests a possible role of extrachromosomal elements in the mode of transfer of this region .
It is of interest that pagC and pagD are divergently transcribed and are both PhoP activated .
There are several examples in the literature of divergently transcribed , regulated genes ; however , most require accessory proteins such as CAP in addition to the regulator to activate transcription ( 2 ) .
An example most similar to the pagC - pagD arrangement and activation is the K. pneumoniae pulA - malX region ( 8 ) .
These two genes are divergently transcribed , and their promoters are arranged back to back .
A region of 134 bp exists between the transcriptional start sites of these genes , which is similar to the intergenic region between pagC and pagD ( 213 bp between the transcriptional start sites ) .
The pulA - malX promoter region is predicted to contain two MalT ( the regulatory protein of this system ) - binding sites , one for each gene .
Other MalT - activated genes require the CAP protein for expression , but the pulA and malX genes do not , possibly because of the high local concentration of the MalT regulator .
Since the intergenic region between the pagC - pagD promoters is even larger than that between the pulA - malX promoters , we speculate that these two genes are not regulated by PhoP binding to a single site but that binding of one or more phosphorylated PhoP molecules to distinct binding sites positively regulates each gene .
