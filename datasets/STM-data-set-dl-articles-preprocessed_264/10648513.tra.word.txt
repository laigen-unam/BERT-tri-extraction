182 , No. 4 0021 - 9193/00 / $ 04.00 0 prpR , ntrA , and ihf Functions Are Required for Expression of the prpBCDE Operon , Encoding Enzymes That Catabolize Propionate in Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium LT2 SERGIO PALACIOS AND JORGE C. ESCALANTE - SEMERENA * Department of Bacteriology , University of Wisconsin -- Madison , Madison , Wisconsin The genes required for the catabolism of propionate in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are organized as two transcriptional units ( prpR and prpBCDE ) that are divergently transcribed from one another .
Sequence homology to genes encoding members of the sigma - 54 family of transcriptional activators and the identification of a consensus sigma - 54 promoter 5 to the prpBCDE operon suggested that PrpR was required to activate expression of this operon .
We isolated insertions in prpR and showed that prpR function was needed for growth on propionate as a carbon and energy source .
A medium - copy - number plasmid carrying the lacZ gene under the control of the native sigma - 54 promoter of prpBCDE was used to study prpBCDE operon expression .
Transcription of the lacZ reporter in prpR , ntrA , and ihfB mutants was 85 - , 83 - , and 15 - fold lower than the level of transcription measured in strains carrying the wild - type allele of the gene tested .
These data indicated that PrpR , IHF , and transcription sigma factor RpoN were required for the expression of the prpBCDE operon .
Further analysis of the involvement of the integration host factor ( IHF ) protein in the expression of this operon is required due to the well - documented pleiotropic effect the lack of this global regulator has on gene expression .
Deletion of the 5 615 - bp portion of the prpR gene resulted in a PrpR c mutant protein that activated prpBCDE transcription regardless of the ability of the strain to synthesize 2 - methylcitrate , the putative coactivator of PrpR .
These results indicate that the N terminus of PrpR is the coactivatorsensing domain of the protein .
When placed under the control of the arabinose - inducible promoter P araBAD , expression of prpR c allele by arabinose had a strong negative effect on growth of the cell .
It is proposed that this deleterious effect of PrpR c may be due to an uncontrolled ATPase activity of PrpR or to cross - activation of genes whose functions negatively affect cell growth under the conditions tested .

The prp locus of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes functions required for the catabolism of propionate in this bacterium ( 13 , 15 , 16 ) .
The prp locus is comprised of two divergently transcribed units .
One unit contains four genes ( prpB , - C , - D , and - E ) organized as an operon , while the other unit contains only the prpR gene ( Fig. 1 ) .
The prpBCDE operon encodes enzymes of the 2 - methylcitric acid cycle ( 17 ) , while prpR encodes a predicted protein with homology to 50 members of the sigma - 54 - dependent family of transcriptional activators ( 15 , 22 ) .
The region between the two transcriptional units is 264 nucleotides long and contains a sigma - 70 promoter for prpR , putative ribosome - binding sites ( RBSs ) for both transcription units , and a consensus RpoN sigma - 70 binding region 5 to prpBCDE ( Fig. 1 ) ( 15 ) .
This sequence analysis suggested the involvement of PrpR and sigma - 54 in the transcription of this operon ( 15 ) .
Recent studies have shown that members of the sigma - 54 dependent activators regulate a variety of pathways and processes ( 21 ) .
This family of proteins is characterized for its resemblance to eucaryotic transcriptional activation mechanisms , which involve binding to an enhancer - like element ( ELE ) located 5 to the promoter ( 2 ) .
These bacterial ELEs act at a distance from the promoter they regulate and exert their effect even when they are moved away from the promoter , regardless of the orientation of the ELE ( 22 ) .
Upon activation by a specific signal , the activator protein bound to the ELE contacts the sigma - 54 RNA polymerase holoenzyme bound to the promoter via a DNA - looping mechanism in which the integration host factor ( IHF ) is thought to be involved ( 3 ) .
The activator - coactivator complex is proposed to catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP to provide the energy necessary for the isomerization of the closed complex into the open complex ( 31 ) .
Sequence analysis of prpR shows the expected three - domain structure reported for other sigma - 54 dependent activators ( Fig. 2 ) .
The activation ( A ) domain ( promoter - proximal 636 bp ) is thought to be involved in signal recognition .
The central ( C ) domain ( 636 to 1,398 bp ) is proposed to contain ATPase activity , and the DNA binding ( D ) domain ( 1,399 to 1,626 bp ) is responsible for binding to the ELE .
The C and D domains of PrpR are 56 % similar and 41 % identical to those of NtrC .
However , the A domain of PrpR is not homologous to A domains of other members of this family of proteins .
This is not surprising because these proteins recognize different environmental signals .
The activity of proteins of this family of activators is regulated by different mechanisms , which include phosphorylation of a conserved residue within the A domain , signal - induced protein - protein interactions , and detection of a small effector molecule ( 26 ) .
Previous work from our laboratory suggested that the coactivator of PrpR is not propionate but most likely 2 - methylcitrate or a derivative of it ( 13 , 33 ) .
In this paper , we show that prpR function is necessary for growth on propionate as carbon 905 906 PALACIOS AND ESCALANTE - SEMERENA J. BACTERIOL .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Culture media , bacterial strains , and growth - conditions .
All strains used in this study were derived from Salmonella serovar Typhimurium LT2 , and their genotypes and the genotypes of the plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
NCE minimal - medium ( 1 ) was supplemented with MgSO 4 ( 1 mM ) and methionine ( 0.5 mM ) .
When added to NCE medium , propionate was at a concentration of 30 mM , glycerol was at 22 mM , and D - ( ) - arabinose was at 50 M ( unless otherwise noted ) .
Luria - Bertani and nutrient broth media were used as rich media ( 5 ) .
Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations ( micrograms/liter ) : kanamycin , 40 ; ampicillin , 50 ; chloramphenicol , 35 ; and tetracycline , 10 .
Cloning and DNA amplifications were routinely performed in Escherichia coli strain DH5 .
Incubation was done at 37 째C with shaking unless otherwise noted .
Genetic crosses involving bacteriophage P22 HT105/1 int201 ( 24 , 25 ) were performed as described elsewhere ( 6 ) .
( ii ) Construction of chromosomal prpR insertions .
Insertion prpR214 : : kan carried in plasmid pPRP55 ( see below ) was moved into the chromosome of strain TR6583 ( prpR ) by a modification of the gene replacement method of Hamilton et al. ( 12 ) .
Strain TR6583 was transformed with plasmid pPRP55 at 30 째C , selecting for kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistance .
Transformants were incubated at 40 째C to arrest pPRP55 replication while ensuring resistance to both antibiotics .
Clones resistant to both antibiotics were considered to have the plasmid integrated into the chromosome .
Phage P22 grown on these clones was used as a donor to transduce strain TR6583 to kanamycin resistance screening for chloramphenicol - sensitive transductants .
Plasmids pPRP56 ( P araBAD - prpR ) and pPRP61 [ P araBAD - prpR ( Con ) ] were transformed into strain JE4403 ( prpR214 : : kan ) to assess complementation of prpR function .
Ampicillin - resistant transformants were replica printed onto NCE minimal - medium supplemented with MgSO 4 , propionate , and methionine , with or without arabinose .
Plasmids pBAD30 and pBAD18s were independently transformed in TR6583 and were used in these experiments as vector - only controls .
Growth behavior was analyzed in 96 - well microtiter dishes ( 200 l of medium per well ) .
Growth was monitored with a Spectramax Plus high - throughput spectrophotometer ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , Calif. ) .
Absorbance readings at 650 nm ( A 650 ) were taken every 10 min for 50 h. Cultures were shaken for 200 s between measurements .
The incubation chamber was maintained at 37 째C .
Each culture had seven replicates .
( i ) DNA isolations and manipulations .
Cells were transformed by the CaCl 2 heat - shock method described elsewhere ( 23 ) .
Plasmid DNA was isolated with the Spin Plasmid Miniprep kit ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , Calif. ) .
Restriction and DNA - modifying enzymes were purchased from Promega ( Madison , Wis. ) .
Pfu - Turbo DNA polymerase was used in all PCR amplifications ( see below ) and was purchased from Stratagene ( La Jolla , Calif. ) .
DNA fragments were isolated from 1 % agarose gels with the Qiaquick Gel Extraction kit from Qiagen .
All enzymes were used under conditions recommended by the manufacturers .
BigDye terminator cycle DNA sequencing ( 14 ) was performed at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison Biotechnology Center .
All DNA amplifications were performed in a 2400 GeneAmp PCR system ( Perkin - Elmer , Branchburg , N.J. ) as described elsewhere ( 16 ) .
The construction of plasmid pPRP25 bla kan P prpBCDE - lacZYA has been previously described ( 33 ) .
A 790 - bp EcoRI fragment containing the prpB and prpR promoters was cloned into the EcoRI site on pRS551 ( 28 ) .
Plasmid pPRP26 carries the prpR promoter ( P prpR ) in the correct orientation for transcribing the lacZYA operon .
Plasmid pPRP26 is 13.2 kb in length and encodes ampicillin and kanamycin resistance .
Plasmid pPRP31 contained a 2 - kb PstI fragment that included prpR and was approximately 300 bp 5 to the predicted initiation codon of prpR .
In this plasmid , prpR is in opposite direction to the lac promoter ( P lac ) on the cloning vector pSU19 ( 20 ) .
Plasmid pPRP31 is 4.3 kb in length and encodes chloramphenicol resistance .
Plasmid pPRP57 ( see below ) was cut with SfiI , blunt ended with Klenow DNA polymerase , and digested with SphI .
The resulting fragment was ligated with pMAK705 ( 12 ) previously cut with HincII , blunt ended , and cut with SphI .
These manipulations resulted in plasmid pPRP55 , which carried the prpR214 : : kan allele .
Plasmid pPRP55 is 7.9 kb in length and encodes chloramphenicol resistance .
The prpR allele with its native RBS was amplified from plasmid pPRP31 with primer A , 5 - GGGGTACCAATTTCTACTTAGATG - 3 ( introduced a KpnI site 5 to the prpR RBS ) , and primer B , 5 - CCTCTAGAA TTTGTCTTAATTATC - 3 ( introduced an XbaI site 3 to the prpR termination codon ) .
The amplified 1.6 - kb fragment was cloned into the KpnI - XbaI sites of the multiple cloning site of plasmid pBAD30 ( 11 ) , cut with the same enzymes .
In plasmid pPRP56 , expression of prpR was under the control of the arabinoseinducible P araBAD promoter .
Plasmid pPRP56 is 6.6 kb in length and encodes ampicillin resistance .
Plasmid pPRP57 was derived from plasmid pPRP8 ( 15 ) .
The kanamycin resistance cassette of plasmid pUC4K ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , N.J. ) was released by cutting the plasmid with PstI , followed by blunt ending with Klenow DNA polymerase .
The resulting fragment was inserted into the BstEII site of pPRP8 .
This site was located 155 bp 3 to the initiation codon of prpR .
Plasmid pPRP57 is 7.9 kb in length and encodes chloramphenicol resistance .
The location of the kanamycin resistance cassette within prpR was verified by DNA sequencing .
A fragment of the prpR gene lacking the promoterproximal 615 bp was PCR amplified with primer C , 5 - TAAGAATTCGGCAA GGGATTACAAACC - 3 , and primer D , 5 - GGGTACCTTAAAGATGAATC TACTG - 3 .
The resulting fragment started 627 bp 3 from the initiation codon and included a KpnI site immediately 3 to the termination codon of prpR .
The amplified fragment was cloned in the same sites of plasmid pBAD18s ( 11 ) .
The use of this cloning vector added six residues to the N terminus of the PrpR c protein .
Plasmid pPRP61 is 6 kb in length and encodes ampicillin resistance .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION prpR function is required for growth of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium on propionate .
To determine whether prpR was required for growth on propionate , a null allele of prpR was introduced into the chromosome by gene replacement techniques .
Inactivation of prpR blocked growth of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium on propionate .
Growth of prpR mutant strain JE4403 on propionate was restored to a wild - type level when a wild - type allele of prpR was expressed in trans with plasmid pPRP56 .
The doubling time for strain JE4405 ( prp214 : : kan / pPRP56 prpR ) on propionate ( 16.8 h ) was not significantly different than the one measured for prpR strain TR6583 ( 16.4 h ) .
Although expression of prpR in plasmid pPRP56 was under the control of the arabinose - inducible P ara - BAD promoter , complementation of function was obtained even in the absence - of - arabinose in the growth medium .
This was interpreted to mean that basal transcription from the P ara - BAD promoter resulted in sufficient levels of PrpR protein .
Addition of 50 M arabinose to the medium did not have any further effect on the rate of growth of the strain .
prpR mutants do not express the prpBCDE operon .
The lack of growth of prpR mutants on propionate was due to their inability to express the prpBCDE operon .
In the presence of propionate , strain JE4044 ( prpR ) expressed the reporter lacZ gene placed under the control of the prpBCDE promoter to levels that were 90 - fold higher than those measured in strain TABLE 2 .

c prpC - lacZ is the abbreviation of prpC114 : : MudJ .
JE4810 ( the prpR mutant ) ( Table 2 ) .
In the absence of propionate , a twofold increase in transcription of the reporter in strain JE4044 over that in strain JE4810 was measured .
This increase likely reflects plasmid copy number effects .
The addition of propionate to the medium did not increase transcription of the reporter in strain JE4810 ( Table 2 ) , indicating that the effect of propionate on prpBCDE expression was exerted via PrpR .
PrpR - dependent transcription of lacZ suggested that the ELE predicted to be required for PrpR function must be contained within the fragment cloned in plasmid pPRP25 .
At present , the ELE has not been identified .
Expression of the prpBCDE operon requires transcription factor sigma - 54 .
The predicted requirement for sigma - 54 for transcription of the prpBCDE operon was investigated with plasmid pPRP25 ( Table 2 ) .
This plasmid had a reporter lacZ gene under the control of the prpBCDE promoter ( P prpBCDE ) .
Plasmid pPRP25 was introduced into strain JE3974 ( the ntrA mutant ) to yield strain JE4820 .
Expression of the lacZ reporter in JE4820 was compared to that in strain JE4044 ( ntrA ) .
Strain JE4043 served as a negative control .
Expression of the lacZ reporter in ntrA strain JE4044 was 86 - fold higher than that in ntrA mutant strain JE4820 ( Table 2 ) , a result consistent with the existence of a consensus sigma - 54 promoter 5 to the prpBCDE operon .
Removal of the putative A domain of PrpR resulted in a coactivator - independent , constitutively active ( PrpR c ) protein .
The effect of the PrpR c protein on the expression of the prpBCDE operon was analyzed in strain JE4593 ( prpC : : MudJ / pPRP61 ) [ prpR ( con ) ] .
Strains JE4871 ( prpC : : MudJ/pPRP56 ) ( prpR ) , and JE4592 ( prpC : : MudJ/pBAD18s ) were used as controls .
Cultures were grown in NCE minimal - medium supplemented with glycerol , with or without propionate .
Wild - type PrpR protein , encoded by plasmid pPRP56 in strain JE4871 , failed to activate transcription in the presence or absence of propionate in the culture medium ( Table 3 ) .
This lack of expression of the reporter was expected because strain JE4871 can not synthesize 2 - methylcitrate , the proposed coactivator of PrpR ( 17 , 33 ) .
The inability of this strain to make 2 - methylcitrate was due to the insertion of the MudJ operon fusion in prpC , the gene encoding 2 - methylcitrate synthase ( 10 , 17 , 19 , 29 ) .
In contrast , transcription of the same MudJ fusion in strain JE4593 carrying plasmid pPRP61 [ encoding prpR ( con ) ] , was 50 - fold higher than the level measured in strain JE4871 in the absence or presence of propionate .
This result indicated that the PrpR c protein no longer required 2 - methylcitrate as a coactivator .
When strain JE4593 was grown in medium containing high concentrations of arabinose ( i.e. , 1 mM ) , growth of the culture was arrested ( data not shown ) .
We speculate that this deleterious effect of PrpR c may be due to an uncontrolled ATPase activity of PrpR or to cross - activation of genes whose functions negatively affect cell growth under the conditions tested .
The global regulatory protein IHF is required for expression of the prpBCDE operon .
The IHF protein has been shown to participate in the activation of sigma - 54 promoters ( 4 ) .
The potential requirement for IHF in prpBCDE expression was investigated by introducing plasmid pPRP25 into an ihfB mutant .
As shown in Table 2 , the absence of IHF resulted in a 15 - fold reduction of prpBCDE expression when propionate was added to the medium .
While this had a drastic effect on the transcription of the reporter , it is unclear whether the effect of the lack of this regulator is direct or indirect .
Further work addressing this issue is necessary before we can understand how transcription activation of the prpBCDE operon is accomplished .
Consistent with these results , however , ihfB mutant strain JE3999 failed to grow on propionate ( data not shown ) .
( i ) Transcription activation of the prpBCDE operon of Salmonella serovar Typhimurium requires the function of the local activator protein PrpR , transcription sigma factor RpoN ( sigma - 54 ) , and IHF .
It is unclear whether the effects of the lack of IHF protein are direct or indirect .
( ii ) The N - terminal A domain of the PrpR protein is most likely the sensing domain to which 2 - methylcitrate , the proposed coactivator of PrpR , binds .
Lack of the A domain renders a constitutively active protein ( referred to as PrpR c ) that no longer requires 2 - methylcitrate to activate prpBCDE expression .
The A domain of PrpR may be important to control the proposed ATPase activity of this protein or to prevent cross - activation of genes whose functions have a negative effect on the growth of the cell .
( iii ) If one assumes that an ELE is needed for the activation of prpBCDE transcription by PrpR , one must conclude that plasmid pPRP25 contains such an element .
The ELE required for prpBCDE expression needs to be defined .
