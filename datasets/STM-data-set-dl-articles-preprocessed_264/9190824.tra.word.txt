179 , No. 12 0021 - 9193/97 / $ 04.00 0 Identification of the ahp Operon of Salmonella typhimurium as a Macrophage - Induced Locus KEVIN P. FRANCIS , † PATRICK D. TAYLOR , CHRISTOPHER J. INCHLEY , AND MAURICE P. GALLAGHER * Division of Biology , University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh EH9 3JR , Scotland Previously , we tagged a macrophage - induced Salmonella typhimurium locus with Mudlux ( K. P. Francis and M. P. Gallagher , Infect .
The insertion lies within the OxyR - regulated ahpC locus and conveys alkyl peroxide sensitivity .
Plasmid - encoded ahp reverses sensitivity but reduces luminescence .
This suggests that OxyR is titrated by the multicopy ahp promoter .
Salmonella typhimurium is an enteroinvasive pathogen of mice and results in a typhoid - like disease .
Following oral ingestion , S. typhimurium cells are thought to invade and traverse the epithelial lining of the intestine ( 7 ) , spreading to the surrounding tissues , where they are engulfed by macrophages .
Generally , virulence loci of S. typhimurium have been identified by screening transposon mutants for alterations in host cell invasion , intracellular survival , or intracellular multiplication ( 6 , 7 , 9 ) , and for the most part , such mutants have correlated well with attenuation .
Exposure of S. typhimurium to hydrogen - peroxide results in a multigenic response , with selective induction of approximately 30 polypeptides ( 4 , 12 ) , of which a subset of 9 are regulated by the transcriptional activator OxyR .
Recently , we reported the construction of a pool of Mudlux fusions in the virulent strain S. typhimurium SL1344 ( 8 ) .
One of the isolates from this pool , MPG203 , was found to luminesce not only in direct response to exposure to hydrogen - peroxide but also during infection of cells of the murine macrophage line J774 .2 .
A number of OxyR - regulated proteins have been characterized ( 1 , 4 ) .
Two of these , in particular , catalase ( encoded by katG ) and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase ( encoded by ahp ) , can be distinguished by the ability to convey resistance to hydrogen - peroxide or alkyl peroxides ( such as cumene peroxide ) , respectively .
When a lawn of MPG203 cells was examined for such properties , they exhibited enhanced sensitivity to cumene in comparison to the parental cell type , SL1344 ( Table 1 ) , but not to hydrogen - peroxide .
This strongly suggested that the Mudlux element had inserted itself within the ahp locus .
We attempted to confirm this by PCR , using oligonucleotides which corresponded to the 5 end of the sense strand of the coding sequence of the first gene of the ahp operon , ahpC ( bases 150 to 167 [ 17 ] ) , and to a 20 - base region in the terminus of the segment of phage Mu ( bases 83 to 64 [ 11 ] ) .
A fragment of approximately 400 bp was amplified and cloned into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pBluescript SK following blunt ending and EcoRI digestion .
( This made use of the natural EcoRI site close to the start of the ahpC coding region [ 17 ] ) .
Sequence analysis revealed that the Mudlux element had inserted itself 318 bases downstream from the translational start of ahpC ( data not shown ) .
The ahp locus is known to be regulated by the transcriptional 3870 .

To confirm that the Mudlux gene fusion was correctly regulated , it was transduced , with P22 , into LT2 derivatives TA4100 and TA4108 ( 4 ) , in which oxyR is either expressed constitutively or has been deleted , respectively .
The responses of exponentially growing cultures of the resulting strains ( designated MPG351 and MPG352 ) to hydrogen - peroxide were then assessed in comparison to MPG203 and an LT2 derivative carrying the ahp : : Mudlux fusion ( designated MPG350 ) .
MPG351 exhibited extensive light production throughout the experiment ( Fig. 1 ) , even in the absence of hydrogen - peroxide , while MPG352 produced no significant light under any conditions .
A typical response was observed from MPG203 and MPG350 ( 8 ) .
These observations firmly TABLE 1 .

The Mudlux fusion in MPG203 is subject to regulation by OxyR .
Cultures , grown overnight in Luria - Bertani medium containing kanamycin ( 50 g ml 1 ) where appropriate , were diluted into fresh medium to approximately 10 4 CFU ml 1 and then incubated aerobically for 90 min at 30 °C .
Subsequently ( time zero ) , bioluminescence was determined in a liquid scintillation counter ( Beckman LS1701 ) by using the tritium channel in the absence ( MPG203 , inverted triangles ; MPG351 , diamonds ; MPG352 , hexagons ; MPG350 , open squares ) or presence ( MPG203 , squares ; MPG351 , triangles ; MPG352 , circles ; MPG350 , open circles ) of added hydrogen - peroxide ( 20 M ) .
establish that OxyR is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the target gene containing the Mudlux element .
Introduction of plasmid pDSA23 , which carries the intact ahp locus from Escherichia coli on pACYC184 ( 15 ) , into MPG203 or SL1344 resulted in a significant reduction in the zone of inhibition caused by cumene and an increase in the zone of inhibition caused by hydrogen - peroxide ( Table 2 ) .
This finding is in agreement with previous studies with E. coli ( 17 ) .
Moreover , from Fig. 2a , it can also be seen that pDSA23 resulted in the virtual abolition of hydrogen - peroxide - induced luminescence from MPG203 , although a typical pattern of light expression was observed from MPG203 containing the parental plasmid pACYC184 .
To determine whether this reflected a detrimental effect of pDSA23 on MPG203 through high - level ahpCF expression or , alternatively , reflected the indirect effects of OxyR sequestration by the plasmid , the experiments were repeated with MPG203 cells containing pPDT12 .
This plasmid carries the ahp operon ( including the promoter region ) of S. typhimurium cloned into pBR322 .
However , in pPDT12 , the ahpCF genes have been disrupted by insertion of the PCR - amplified cml locus from pBR325 into the MluI and HpaI sites of ahpC and ahpF , respectively ( Table 1 ) .
When MPG203 ( pPDT12 ) was exposed to hydrogen - peroxide ( Fig. 2b ) , its luminescence was reduced , as previously found with pDSA23 , suggesting that the reduced light production arose as a consequence of OxyR titration .
It is likely that this also explains the enhanced sensitivity of MPG203 ( pDSA23 ) and SL1344 ( pDSA23 ) to hydrogen - peroxide observed on solid medium ( Table 2 ) .
In conclusion , we have provided clear evidence that the Mudlux element in MPG203 lies within the ahpC gene of S. typhimurium and is regulated by OxyR .
This directly implicates the ahp locus in responding to the oxidative burst of macrophages and highlights the potential of AhpCF and , possibly , other OxyR - regulated gene products as in - vivo - expressed an - FIG. 2 .

A 0.1 - ml sample was spread on Luria - Bertani agar , and 10 l of a 3 % solution of cumene peroxide or hydrogen - peroxide was added to a cellulose nitrate antibiotic assay disc ( 6 - mm diameter ) placed in the center of the plate .
The plates were incubated at 30 °C overnight , and the diameters of the zones of inhibition were determined .

In relation to this , it is also noteworthy that expression of ahpC by Mycobacterium species has been reported during their interaction with macrophages ( 5 ) .
Sequestration of OxyR by the ahp promoter carried on a multicopy plasmid may also have implications for the use of this promoter for in - vivo expression of foreign antigens by using live attenuated Salmonella strains as vehicles for immunization .
