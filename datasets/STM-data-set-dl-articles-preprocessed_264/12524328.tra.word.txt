Mucoidy is caused by derepression of wca genes ( necessary for capsule synthesis ) ; these genes are regulated by the RcsC/YojN/RcsB phosphorelay system and by the RcsA coregulator .
The induction of wca expression in an igaA1 mutant is suppressed by mutations in rcsA and rcsC .
Reduced motility is caused by lowered expression of the flagellar master operon , flhDC , and is suppressed by mutations in rcsB or rcsC , suggesting that mutations in the igaA gene reduce motility by activating the RcsB/C system .
A null igaA allele can be maintained only in an igaA / igaA merodiploid , indicating that igaA is an essential gene .
Lethality is suppressed by mutations in rcsB , rcsC , and yojN , but not in rcsA , suggesting that the viability defect of an igaA null mutant is mediated by the RcsB/RcsC system , independently of RcsA ( and therefore of the wca genes ) .
Because all the defects associated with igaA mutations are suppressed by mutations that block the RcsB/RcsC system , we propose a functional interaction between the igaA gene product and either the Rcs regulatory network or one of its regulated products .
Ascreen for mutants able to overgrow within a fibro - swarming and motility ( Dufour et al. 1998 ) .
Current blast cell line identified functions of Salmonella evidence suggests that umoB encodes a membrane pro- enterica involved in growth restraint within nonphago - tein that regulates genes involved in flagellar synthesis cytic eukaryotic cells ( Cano et al. 2001 ) .
One of such mutants ( Dufour et al. 1998 ) .

The yrfF and Originally described as a regulator of capsule synthesis igaA ORFs are located at an equivalent position on the in E. coli ( Gottesman et al. 1985 ) , the RcsB - RcsC system chromosomal gene maps of E. coli and and S. enterica has been shown to participate in a variety of cellular serovar Typhimurium ( Blattner et al. 1997 ; McClel - processes , which include cell division control in E. coli land et al. 2001 ) .

Unless indicated otherwise , the strains derive from the mouse - virulent strain SL1344 ( Hoiseth and Stocker 1981 ) .
Transductional crosses using phage P22 HT 105/1 int201 ( Schmieger 1972 ; G. Roberts , unpublished results ) , henceforth called P22 HT , were used for strain construction operations involving chromosomal markers and for transfer of plasmids among Salmonella strains .
The transduction pro- tocol was as described by Maloy ( 1990 ) .
To obtain phage - free isolates , transductants were purified by streaking on green plates ( Chan et al. 1972 ) .
Phage sensitivity was tested by crossstreaking with the clear - plaque mutant P22 H5 .
The alleles flhDC5213 : : MudA and fliA6002 : : MudA were originally harbored by strains KK1107 and KK1108 , respectively ( Kutsu - kake and Iino 1994 ) .

The duplication DUP4102 [ fliC5050 * MudA * flhDC5213 ] , originally carried on a LT2 - derived strain ( TH4313 ) , was a gift from Kelly T. Hughes a recently described ancillary protein , YojN ( Takeda et al. 2001 ) ; and additional sensors that transmit external signals to the membrane - bound RcsC sensor ( Clarke et al. 1997 ; Kelley and Georgopoulos 1997 ; Chen et al. 2001 ) .
We show that mutations affecting any of the rcsB , rcsC , and yojN genes suppress the defects associated with igaA mutations ( lethality , mucoidy , and reduced motility ) .
Mucoidy is also suppressed by rcsA mutations .
These observations provide genetic evidence that IgaA might be part of a novel signaling pathway involving the RcsB - RcsC system .

Samples were taken every hour for SDS - PAGE and ( Cano et al. 2001 ; Costa and Antón 2001 ) , thus raising Western blot analysis .
the possibility that the igaA1 allele and mucM alleles could all be ascribed to a single class .
Because mucM RESULTS mutants were isolated by resistance to d - mecillinam ( Costa and Antón 2001 ) , we carried out tests of d - mecillinam Suppression of the mucoid phenotype of an igaA1 resistance in strains SL1344 ( igaA ) and SV4450 mutant by MudJ insertions : The igaA1 mutation causes ( igaA1 ) .

This absence of differences suggests that the igaA1 allele is unrelated to the mucM alleles described by Costa and Antón ( 2001 ) .

Therefore , delayed halo igaA1 and mucM alleles will be described below .

The insertion was Lac in an IgaA background and 1998 ) .
In enteric bacteria , as in P. mirabilis , the flhDC Lac in the presence of the igaA1 mutation .
Analysis of operon encodes transcription factors necessary to trig - - galactosidase activity confirmed that the igaA1 mutager the genetic cascade that controls flagellar synthesis tion caused an increase in the expression of the gmm - ( Gygi et al. 1995 ; Macnab 1996 ; Furness et al. 1997 ; 21 : : lac fusion ( Table 2 ) .
For these experiments , cultures Claret and Hughes 2000 ) .
Hence , a defect in flhDC were prepared in LB , where the mucoidy caused by the expression causes reduced motility ( Macnab 1996 ) .
igaA mutation is higher .
In the wild type , expression of The homology between igaA and umoB led us to investigmm was low , as previously described for E. coli wca genes gate whether the igaA1 mutation affected the expression ( Gottesman 1995 ) .
An additional observation was that of flagellar genes , using transcriptional lac fusions in the presence of an rcsB mutation suppressed derepres - flhDC and fliA .
Evidence that flhDC undergoes autogesion of gmm in the igaA1 background ( Table 2 ) .
This nous positive regulation ( Kutsukake 1997 ) led us also result suggests that derepression of colanic acid synthe - to compare flhDC expression in FlhDC and FlhDC sis by the igaA1 mutation is exerted via the Rcs regulatory backgrounds .
The latter experiments were performed system .
This view is supported by the observation , de - in a merodiploid strain ( SV4325 ) , which permits analysis scribed above , that rcsA and rcsC mutations suppress the of the flhDC5213 : : lac fusion in the presence of a wildmucoid phenotype of an igaA1 mutant .
The results shown in Figure 1 can The igaA1 mutation causes a defect in motility : The be summarized as follows : DNA sequence relatedness between the igaA ORF and the umoB gene of P. mirabilis ( Dufour et al. 1998 ) raised i. Expression of flhDC decreased sixfold in an igaA1 background .
The difference was only threefold when the possibility that igaA1 mutants might be impaired in flhDC expression was measured in a FlhDC / FlhDC motility .
Hence , we compared the motility of isogenic merodiploid .

-- Effects of rcs and wca mutations on flhDC operon expression in an igaA1 background .
The strains used were , from top to bottom , SV4614 , SV4615 , SV4616 , SV4623 , SV4625 , SV4617 , SV4618 , SV4620 , SV4619 , SV4622 , and SV4624 .
The data shown are the means and standard deviations of at least three independent experiments .
A screen of 2000 independent transductants did not reveal any mucoid colony , suggesting that the igaA1 mutation was recessive .
Segregation analysis ( Anderson and Roth 1977 ) confirmed the recessivity of the igaA1 mutation .
Twentyfour Tc r Cm r transductants were grown in LB without antibiotics .
Cultures were diluted and spread on LB agar .
Single colonies were then replica printed to LB agar with - tetracycline .
Eight of the 24 transductants segregated mucoid colonies .
All the mucoid colonies were Cm s , thereby confirming that the nonmucoid merodiploids carried the igaA1 mutation .
The igaA1 mutation is therefore recessive and , in principle , may cause loss of function .
The igaA gene of S. enterica is essential : The igaA1 mutation is a base substitution that putatively changes a histidine moiety to arginine ( Cano et al. 2001 ) ; thus , a priori , the igaA1 allele could be null or leaky .
To compare the properties of igaA1 with those of a definite null allele , the igaA gene was knocked out in - vitro .
The wild - type igaA allele carried on plasmid pIZ998 was inter - rupted at its single BamHI site with the KIXX ( Km r ) cassette from pUC4 - KIXX .
Attempts to replace the chro - mosomal igaA gene with this construct failed ( data not shown ) , thereby raising the possibility that igaA was an essential gene .
To test this hypothesis , a suicide plasmid containing the igaA2 : : KIXX mutation ( pIZ1551 ) was constructed .
Plasmid pIZ1551 is a pGP704 derivative ( Miller and Mekalanos 1988 ) and was stably main - tained in E. coli S17 pir ( Simon et al. 1983 ) .
Plasmid pIZ1551 was then transferred by conjugation to strain SV4321 , which carries a MudP - held duplication of the cysG - argA chromosomal region ( Camacho and Casadesús 2001 ) .
Transconjugants were selected on LB plates supplemented with kanamycin ( to select plasmid transfer ) and chloramphenicol ( to counterselect the donor ) .
Because the plasmid can not replicate in a strain devoid of - protein , Km r transconjugants can be formed only by either plasmid integration in the chromosome or homologous recombination between one resident igaA gene and the incoming igaA2 : : KIXX allele .
The latter event yields Km r Ap s transconjugants , while plasmid inte - gration generates Km r Ap r transconjugants .
An ampicil - lin - sensitive igaA / igaA2 : : KIXX merodiploid ( SV4322 ) was obtained by this procedure .
To confirm the presence of both alleles , DNA from SV4322 was PCR ampli - fied using igaA - flanking primers .
Two amplification frag - ments of 4.2 and 5.8 kb were obtained ( data not shown ) .
The size of the igaA locus is 4.2 kb and that of the KIXX cassette is 1.6 kb : hence the merodiploid contained both an intact igaA locus and a knockout allele .
When the duplication carried by strain SV4322 was allowed to segregate in chloramphenicol - free medium , MudJ insertions in rcsB or rcsC , but not in rcsA , suppress the defect in flhDC expression caused by the mutation igaA1 : To investigate whether reduced expression of the flhDC operon in an igaA1 background was suppressed by suppressors of mucoidy , we constructed a set of strains that carried an flhDC : : lac fusion and the igaA1 mutation in combination with wca or rcs mutations .
Aside from the rcsA and the rcsC alleles described above , a collection rcsB allele ( rcsB70 : : Tn10dCm ) was also used .
As shown in Figure 2 , rcsB and rcsC mutations suppressed the flhDC expression defect in an igaA1 background .
None of the wca insertions exerted any effect on flhDC expression .
An rcsA mutation failed also to restore flhDC expression in an igaA1 mutant , suggesting that IgaA might regulate flhDC via RcsB/RcsC and that RcsA is not required .
It must be noted that other examples of loci regulated by RcsB/RcsC , but not by RcsA , are found in the literature ( Gottesman 1995 ; Clavel et al. 1996 ; Virlogeux et al. 1996 ; Davalos - Garcia et al. 2001 ) .
The igaA1 mutation is recessive : Strain 4215 carries aG → A transition in the putative igaA ORF ( Cano et al. 2001 ) .
To examine whether this mutation was dominant or recessive , the igaA1 mutation was introduced into a merodiploid strain carrying a chromosomal duplication of the argA - cysG region , which encompasses centisomes 64 -- 75 ( Camacho and Casadesús 2001 ) .
For this purpose , strain SV4321 was transduced with a P22 HT lysate grown on SV4254 .
Tc r Cm r transductants were all Cm s colonies were kanamycin sensitive .
Because the zhf - 6311 : : Tn10dTc insertion is of haploid segregants carrying the igaA2 : : KIXX allele 35 % linked to the igaA1 mutation ( Cano et al. 2001 ) , supported the view that a null igaA allele might be lethal .
dominance can be expected to result in 35 % of mu - This view received further support from experiments in Regulation of wca and flhDC by igaA 1519 which a P22 HT lysate grown on strain SV4322 ( igaA / igaA2 : : KIXX ) was used to transduce SL1344 ( igaA , haploid ) and SV4321 ( igaA / igaA , merodiploid ) .
Kanamycin - resistant transductants appeared at frequencies 1000 - fold higher in SV4321 than in SL1344 : around 10 6 and 10 9 per plaque - forming unit ( PFU ) , respectively .
Altogether , these observations suggest that the igaA locus of S. enterica is essential , at least under the conditions assayed .
A corollary is that the original igaA1 mutation may be leaky .
Interestingly , the essential condition of igaA in S. enterica is not shared by the related gene umoB Figure 3 .
-- Growth of IgaA , IgaA , and IgaA RcsC of P. mirabilis , where insertion mutations have been de - strains on LB - glucose - ampicillin ( left ) and LB - arabinose - ampiscribed ( Dufour et al. 1998 ) .
The strains used were SV4577 ( igaA / Because igaA is the promoter - proximal gene within pNG1166 ) , SV4629 ( igaA2 : : KIXX rcsC52 : : MudP/pNG1166 ) , a putative operon that may contain four genes ( yrfF , and SV4578 ( igaA2 : : KIXX/pNG1166 ) .
In the latter , expres - sion of the plasmid - borne igaA gene is conditional , driven yrfG , yrfH , and yrfI ) , we investigated whether the lethality by the arabinose - dependent P BAD promoter .
The assays were of the igaA2 : : KIXX mutation was caused by a polar effect carried out as described by Guzman et al. ( 1995 ) , and the on downstream genes .
For this purpose , a KIXX cassette concentration of ampicillin was 30 mg/liter .
was introduced in the second ORF of the putative operon , yrfG ( data not shown ) .
The yrfG : : KIXX mutant was viable , as indicated by the observation that strains plates , but not on glucose .
In contrast , IgaA and IgaA SL1344 ( igaA , haploid ) and SV4321 ( igaA / igaA , merodiploid ) RcsC strains ( SV4577 and SV4629 ) grew well on both could be transduced at similar frequencies media .
These experiments confirm that lack of igaA ( 10 6 / PFU ) with a P22 lysate carrying the yrfG : : KIXX expression alone prevents growth of S. enterica in stanconstruct .
We thus concluded that the lethality of the dard laboratory conditions .

To investigate whether mutations affecting the Finally , we tested whether the lethality caused by a Rcs regulatory system also suppressed the lethality null igaA mutation could be complemented by a wildtype caused by the null allele igaA2 : : KIXX , transductional igaA allele carried on a plasmid .
For this purpose , crosses were performed .
The recipients were SV4379 plasmid pNG1166 was transduced to SL1344 .
The resulting ( RcsA ) , SV4380 ( RcsB ) , and SV4406 ( RcsC ) .
The strain was then transduced with a P22 HT lysate donor was an igaA / igaA2 : : KIXX merodiploid ( SV4322 ) .

Their frequencies ( per PFU ) were binose .
Km r transductants appeared at frequencies 10 6 in the RcsB and RcsC recipients and 10 9 10 6 / PFU , suggesting that the igaA2 : : KIXX mutation in the RcsA recipient .
Hence , lack of RcsB or RcsC did not impair viability in the presence of the igaA allele functions does suppress the lethality of an igaA null carried on pNG1166 .
To confirm that the igaA2 : : KIXX mutation , but lack of RcsA does not .
This suppressor construct had recombined with the recipient chromosome pattern is identical to that found for flhDC expression ( and not with plasmid pNG1166 ) , a putatively in an igaA1 background ( see above ) .
complemented isolate was lysed with P22 HT .
The lysate Search for Tn10 insertions that suppress the lethality was used to transduce SL1344 , selecting Ap r .
Transduc - caused by a null igaA allele : Mutagenesis with Tn10dTc tants were obtained at a frequency of 10 5 / PFU , and was carried out in strain SL1344 ; five pools of Tn10dTc all ( 100/100 ) were Km s .
If the same lysate was used to insertions , each containing some 10,000 independent select kanamycin resistance , transductants were extremely isolates , were then prepared .
The pools were grown in rare ( 10 9 / PFU ) and were Ap s .

These experiments confirmed that The donor was the merodiploid strain SV4322 ( igaA / the donor carried both an intact plasmid pNG1166 and igaA2 : : KIXX ) .
Km r transductants were selected on the chromosomal igaA2 : : KIXX construct .
This strain was LB - kanamycin plates .
Each cross yielded 5 -- 30 Km r transductants .

These isolates were then subjected to reconstruction analysis : i. Fifty independent candidates were lysed with P22 HT , and the resulting lysates were used to transduce SL1344 , selecting tetracycline resistance .
Tc r transductants obtained in these crosses were transduced with an SV4322 lysate , selecting kanamy - cin resistance .
As a control , the merodiploid strain SV4321 ( igaA / igaA ) was also transduced with the same lysate .
Whenever Km r transductants were ob - tained at similar frequencies in SV4231 and in the putative suppressor - carrying isolates , evidence ex - isted that the igaA2 : : KIXX mutation was viable in the genetic background of the latter .
In such cases , the frequency of transductants was 10 6 / PFU .
Other - wise , transduction occurred at frequencies 10 9 / PFU ; these rare transductants were presumed to carry suppressor mutations of spontaneous origin and were discarded .
These experiments provided us with six independent suppressor - carrying isolates in which suppression of le - thality appeared to be associated with a Tn10dTc insertion .
One boundary of each Tn10dTc insertion was then sequenced using a Tn10 - derived primer ( Way and Kleckner 1984 ) .
Two of the insertions mapped in rscC , thereby confirming that lack of RcsC suppresses the lethality of an igaA null mutation .
The four remaining Tn10dTc insertions mapped in yojN , a locus located between ompC and rcsB on the Salmonella chromosome ( McClelland et al. 2001 ) .
Mutations in yojN also suppressed the mucoidy associated with igaA mutations and the low expression of flhDC ( data not shown ) .
Suppression by yojN mutations strengthens the evidence that IgaA interacts with the RcsB - RcsC regulatory system , since YojN has been shown to participate in the phosphorelay signaling pathway RcsC → RcsB ( Takeda et al. 2001 ) .
The lethality caused by a null igaA allele does not involve changes in the level of the cell division protein FtsZ : Because IgaA appears to interact with the RcsB - Figure 5 .
-- Levels of IgaA and FtsZ in protein extracts from SL1344 ( wildtype , lane 1 ) , SV4215 ( igaA1 , lane 2 ) , SV4379 ( rcsA , lane 3 ) , SV4406 ( rcsB , lane 4 ) , SV4380 ( rcsC , lane 5 ) , SV4343 ( igaA1 rcsA , lane 6 ) , SV4402 ( igaA1 rcsB , lane 7 ) , SV4404 ( igaA1 rcsC , lane 8 ) , SV4345 ( igaA2 : : KIXX rcsC , lane 9 ) , and SV4443 ( igaA2 : : KIXX rcsB , lane 10 ) .
The extracts were prepared from bacteria growing exponentially in LB .
RcsC regulatory system and the latter has been shown to regulate positively the cell division genes ftsA and ftsZ ( Carballès et al. 1999 ) , a conceivable explanation for the lethality associated with null igaA alleles might be cell division arrest , as a consequence of overproduction of these cell division proteins .
In E. coli , the key protein that regulates the frequency and the timing of cell division is FtsZ ( Ward and Lutkenhaus 1985 ) .
On these grounds , we investigated whether a decrease in IgaA synthesis altered the level of FtsZ .
For this purpose , we carried out shift - down experiments in which strain SV4578 ( igaA2 : : KIXX/pNG1166 ) was transferred from arabinose to glucose medium .
The amounts of IgaA and FtsZ in cell extracts obtained at different times after arabinose depletion were analyzed by Western blotting using anti - IgaA and anti - FtsZ polyclonal antibodies .
The results were clear - cut : While a swift decrease in IgaA was observed , the level of FtsZ remained unchanged ( Figure 4 ) .
These data suggest that the viability defect of igaA mutants is not caused by FtsZ overproduction and reveal a further difference between igaA and mucM alleles , since the latter increase transcription from the ftsA1 promoter at the ftsQAZ operon ( Costa and Antón 2001 ) .
Further evidence that the proposed functional interaction between IgaA and the RcsB - RcsC system does not involve changes in the level of FtsZ was pro- vided by the following observations : ( i ) The levels of FtsZ remained largely unchanged in strains carrying igaA mutations , alone or combined with rcsA , rcsB , and rcsC alleles ( Figure 5 ) and ( ii ) strains carrying the igaA1 mutation do not form minicells ( not shown ) .
DISCUSSION Mutants of S. enterica carrying the igaA1 allele show a mucoid phenotype caused by derepression of wca genes .
The induction of wca gene expression in an igaA1 mutant is suppressed by mutations in rcsA and rcsC .
The igaA1 mutation also causes lowered expression of the flagellar master operon , flhDC , which results in lowered motility .
The latter defect is suppressed by mutations in rcsB or rcsC .
Altogether , these observations support a model in which loss of IgaA causes activation of the Regulation of wca and flhDC by igaA 1521 RcsB/C system , leading both to derepression of wca only in a merodiploid carrying a wild - type igaA allele , genes and to repression of the flhDC operon .
However , a either chromosomal or plasmid borne .
However , null noteworthy observation is that , in an igaA1 background , IgaA mutants are viable in the presence of rcsB , rcsC , activation of colanic acid synthesis requires RcsA while or yojN mutations , indicating again the existence of a repression of flagellar formation is RcsA independent .

A tentative explanation is that , in the absence colanic acid synthesis and flagellar formation are remito of IgaA , activation of the RcsB - RcsC system might lead niscent of the inverse relationship between capsule synsion derepression of a gene or operon whose overexpres - thesis and flagellar biogenesis described in several bacteeron , is lethal .
An obvious candidate was the ftsQZA opthesis rial species : ( i ) Biofilm - forming E. coli repress flagellar which is known to be positively regulated by the genes and induce capsular gene expression ( Prigent - RcsB/C system ( Carballès et al. 1999 ; Costa and Combaret et al. 1999 ) ; ( ii ) production of alginate and Antón 2001 ) .
However , we provide evidence that the synthesis of flagella by Pseudomonas aeruginosa show in - viability defect of null igaA mutants does not involve verse and mutually exclusive regulation ( Garrett et al. .

However , the view that product might coordinate them , perhaps in response only point igaA mutations may be tolerated is countered to environmental signals .
This coordination would be by observations made in E. coli , where a partial deletion exerted via the RcsB/C regulatory system .
