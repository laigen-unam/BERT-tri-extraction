Virulence inhibitors are less likely to generate bacterial resistance , which makes them superior to traditional antibiotics that target bacterial viability .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , an important food - borne human pathogen , has type III secretion system ( T3SS ) as its major virulence factor .
T3SS secretes effector proteins to facilitate invasion into host cells .
In this study , we identified several analogs of cytosporone B ( Csn - B ) that strongly block the secretion of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) - associated effector proteins , without affecting the secretion of flagellar protein FliC in - vitro .
Csn - B and two other derivatives exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on SPI - 1-mediated invasion to HeLa cells , while no significant toxicity to bacteria was observed .
Nucleoid proteins Hha and H - NS bind to the promoters of SPI - 1 regulator genes hilD , hilC , and rtsA to repress their expression and consequently regulate the expression of SPI - 1 apparatus and effector genes .
We found that Csn - B upregulated the transcription of hha and hns , implying that Csn - B probably affected the secretion of effectors through the Hha -- H - NS regulatory pathway .
In summary , this study presented an effective SPI - 1 inhibitor , Csn - B , which may have potential in drug development against antibiotic - resistant Salmonella .
The type III secretion system ( T3SS ) is a highly specialized virulent protein nano - injector , which traverses the cell wall of Gram - negative bacteria and transports effector proteins from bacterial cytoplasm into eukaryotic host cells to facilitate bacterial invasion and dissemination ( 1 , 2 ) .
As an important virulence factor , T3SS is highly conserved in structure and function among different Gram - negative bacteria ( 3 -- 5 ) , such as Salmonella spp. , Yersinia spp. , Shigella spp. , Pseudomonas spp. , enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) , enterohemorrhagic E. coli ( EHEC ) , Chlamydia spp. , and Burkholderia spp. , and some specific plant - pathogenic bacteria , Erwinia spp. , Xanthomonas campestris , Ralstonia solanacearum , and Rhizobium spp. ( 3 , 6 , 7 ) .
Similar to flagella genetically and structurally ( 8 -- 10 ) , T3SS consists of approximately 20 proteins ( 3 -- 5 ) .
T3SS is often absent in nonpathogenic bacteria ( 2 , 11 -- 13 ) and not essential for bacterial growth ( 2 , 14 -- 16 ) .
Traditional antibiotics , which directly kill pathogenic microorganisms , have a high likelihood of bacterial resistance ( 17 ) .
In contrast , T3SS - blocking agents can reduce the pathogenicity of Gram - negative pathogens while having no inhibitory effect on bacterial growth .
This property of T3SS - blocking agents makes them ideal for new antibiotic development ( 17 ) .
T3SS is increasingly being proposed and explored as an attractive drug target for developing novel antibacterial - agents ( 17 , 18 ) .
Several series of T3SS inhibitors have been identified by wholecell - based screening methods , such as the reporter gene screening system ( 19 ) , enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ( 20 ) , contact hemolysis screening system ( 21 , 22 ) , and sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) ( 23 , 24 ) .
Salicylidene acylhydrazides have a broad spectrum to inhibit T3SS in several important Gram - negative pathogens , i.e. , Yersinia spp. ( 14 , 25 -- 27 ) , Chlamydia spp. ( 28 -- 34 ) , Salmonella spp. ( 35 -- 37 ) , Shigella spp. ( 38 ) , and EHEC ( 39 ) .
A variety of other synthesized compounds , N - phenylbenzamides ( 19 , 25 , 40 ) , thiazolidinones ( 41 , 42 ) , and salicylideneanilines ( 20 ) and several natural products , caminosides ( 23 , 24 ) , and phenolic acids ( 43 , 44 ) were also identified as T3SS inhibitors .
Salmonella enterica is an important pathogen of humans and animals .
It can cause diseases ranging from mild gastroenteritis to severe systemic infection and is a serious problem for public health , as antibiotic - resistant strains are constantly emerging worldwide .
The development of new control and treatment regimens , therefore , is an urgent affair ( 45 ) .
The pathogenicity of S. enterica mainly depends on two T3SSs , encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) and SPI - 2 .
SPI - 1 mediates invasion of the intestinal epithelium and induction of proinflammatory responses through injecting effector proteins into host cells , while SPI - 2 regulates the replication of bacteria in host phagocytic cells ( 46 ) .
To exploit novel antibacterial - agents targeting SPI - 1 , we have used SDS - PAGE and Western blotting in this study to assess the effect of a series of synthetic compounds on secretion of SPI - 1 effector proteins in - vitro .
We identified several strong and selective inhibitors that blocked the secretion of SPI - 1 effector proteins and invasion of Salmonella into HeLa cells while exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity .
The preliminary structure - activity relationship ( SAR ) and mechanism of action were also discussed in the study .

In short , S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells were grown overnight in LB broth ( 0.2 % L - arabinose ) at 25 °C .
The overnight culture was diluted 10 times in fresh LB ( 0.2 % L - arabinose ) and grown for4hat37 °C with agitation in the presence or absence of different compound at a final concentration of 100 M .
The cultures were diluted 10 - fold to measure the optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) using an Eppendorf Biophotometer Plus .
The bacteria were pelleted by repeated centrifugation ( 14,000 g , 10 min ) , and the secreted proteins in the supernatant were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) at a final concentration of 10 % .
The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C .
Pellets were washed by ice - cold acetone twice and dissolved in an appropriate volume of sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer , based on OD 600 values of the cultures .
This was to confirm that the protein samples were derived from cultures containing equivalent numbers of bacteria .
The samples were immediately heated for 10 min at 95 °C to denature the proteins and subsequently analyzed by SDS - PAGE .
Proteins were visualized either by staining with Coomassie blue or by Western blots as detailed below .
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells were cultured and treated using the same procedure described under `` Isolation and detection of secreted proteins .
'' Proteins were separated by 9 % SDS - PAGE and then electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) ( Millipore Immobilon - P ) membrane using a wet transfer apparatus ( Bio - Rad ) .
The blotted membrane was incubated in blocking solution ( 5 % [ wt/vol ] bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] in Tris - buffered saline mixed with Tween 20 [ TBST ] ) for 1hatroom temperature .
The membrane was incubated in 5 % BSA supplemented with anti - SipC monoclonal antibody or anti - FliC monoclonal antibody for2hatroom temperature or overnight at 4 °C and then washed three times with TBST for 15 min .
The membrane was incubated in TBST supplemented with an anti - mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) for1hatroom temperature and then washed three times with TBST .

The results were analyzed by the relative intensity of the secreted protein level obtained from Image Lab Software .
The 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2-yl ) -2,5 - diphenyl - tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) method was used to determine the effect of compounds on the growth - rate of host cells ( 48 ) .
HeLa cells ( 4,000 to 5,000 ) were seeded in 96 - well plates ( flat - bottom , tissue - culture - treated plates ; Costar ) in triplicate , incubated in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) for 12 h , and then treated with compounds at final concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 100 M. After4hoftreatment , MTT solution ( 10 l , 5 mg/ml in PBS ; Sigma ) was added to each well .
Cells were incubated for 3hat37 °C , and then the supernatant was discarded .
DMSO ( 200 l ; Sigma ) was added to each well , and the wells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C .
The absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader ( Bio - Rad 680 ) .
The data represented the percent viability compared to that of the control .
All the experiments were done in triplicate .
To determine the effect of compounds on S. enterica serovar Typhimurium invasion of host cells , a gentamicin protection assay was performed according to the method described before ( 37 ) with minor modifications .
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was cultured from 25 °C to 37 °C to induce SPI - 1 as described in reference 36 .
HeLa cells ( 2 10 4 ; in DMEM , 10 % FBS ) were seeded in 24 - well plates ( flat - bottom , tissue - culture - treated plates ; Costar ) , and the plates were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 .
Meanwhile , S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells were cultured overnight at 25 °C with agitation .
The overnight culture of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was diluted 10 - fold in LB in the presence or absence of compounds at a final concentration of 100 M and cultured for 1hat37 °C .
HeLa cells were precultured with DMEM without FBS for 30 min and then infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 .
One hour after infection at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 , the culture medium was discarded and the cells were washed with PBS .
DMEM supplemented with 100 g/ml gentamicin was added to each well to kill noninvasive S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells , and incubation was continued for another 1 h .
After incubation , the HeLa cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed with 1 % Triton X - 100 solution .
The CFU of bacteria were counted by plating the appropriate dilution in LB with 0.2 % L - arabinose .

2192 aac.asm.org Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy Csn - B Affects T3SS of S. enterica Serovar Typhimurium Measurement of bacterial growth .
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 8956 was cultured in LB supplemented with 0.2 % L - arabinose at 37 °C and then diluted at 1:100 in new LB broth and incubated for5hat37 °C in the presence or absence of compounds .
At the time points indicated , the OD 570 of the culture was measured using a microplate reader ( Bio - Rad 680 ) .
Two independent experiments were performed , and three replicate samples were used in each experiment .
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells were cultured and treated by compounds or DMSO under the same procedure described under `` Isolation and detection of secreted proteins .
'' The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 5 min , and the culture supernatant was collected to detect extracellular proteins .
The pellet was resuspended in PBS with the same volume of LB - medium and ultrasonicated until the opaque suspension became clear .
The lysis mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 5 min and divided into two fractions : intracellular soluble proteins and cell debris .
A bacterial culture with the same volume as that fractionated previously was directly ultrasonicated until the opaque suspension was clear .
The lysis mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 5 min , and the supernatant was collected for detection of total soluble proteins .
To study whether the effect of Csn - B on SPI - 1 was linked to protein degradation , different protease - inhibitors were used in this assay .
The protease - inhibitor PMSF at a final concentration of 1 mM or leupeptin at a final concentration of 20 g/ml was added to the PBS - resuspended solution of pellets .
Proteins from different fractions were gathered under the same procedure described earlier .
Proteins SipC and FliC in different fractions were analyzed by Western blots .
Real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) .
To study the induced or repressed genes by Csn - B , the relative transcriptional levels were determined by real - time PCR .
Primers ( see Table S1 in the supplemental material ) used in this study were designed by Primer Premier 5.0 software .
An overnight culture of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium at 25 °C with agitation was diluted 100 - fold in LB ( 0.2 % L - arabinose ) and grown in the presence of 100 M Csn - B or DMSO at the same volume for4hat37 °C .
The overnight culture was diluted 100 - fold and continued to grow for 4 h at 25 °C with agitation as the noninduced group .
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells were collected , and total bacterial RNA was isolated using a TRIzol Plus RNA purification kit ( Invitrogen ) .
The cDNA was synthesized using the RevertAid first - strand cDNA synthesis kit ( Fermentas ) with random hexamer as a primer following the manufacturer 's instructions .
The cDNA ( 25 ng ) was amplified by the use of SYBR Premix Ex Taq ( TaKaRa , Dalian , China ) and 10 - pmol primers for target sequences on a real plex 2 Mastercycler ( Eppendorf , Hamburg , Germany ) .
After completion of 35 PCR cycles , melt curve data were generated to ascertain template - independent amplification .
The comparative C T ( cycle threshold ) method was used for analysis of relative changes in transcriptional levels ( 49 ) .
The change in gene transcription was calculated using the formula sample/control 2 CT , where C T is the C T of the sample minus the C T of the control and C T is the C T of the target gene minus the C T of the 16S rRNA ( internal control ) ( 49 ) .
All PCR experiments were performed with three replicates to obtain standard deviations .
Gene cloning and overexpression of HilA .
To construct the HilAoverexpressing strain , the gene sequence ranging from 15 bp upstream of the hilA initiation codon to its stop codon was amplified from genomic DNA of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium UK - 1 8956 by PCR .
The primers used were as follows : hilA forward , 5 = - CGGAATTCGAATACACTAT TATCATGC - 3 = ( EcoRI ) ; hilA reverse , 5 = - GCTCTAGATTACCGTAATT TAATCAAGC - 3 = ( XbaI ) .
Plasmid pKD46 was digested by ClaI and EcoRI to obtain the araC pBAD activator - promoter sequence ( 50 ) ; at the same time , plasmid pWSK29 ( 51 ) was digested by ClaI and XbaI .
Then these three DNA fragments were purified by a gel extraction kit ( OMEGA ) and ligated by a DNA ligation kit ( TaKaRa , Dalian , China ) to construct plasmid pBAD - hilA - pWSK29 .
The constructed plasmid was introduced into electrocompetent S. enterica serovar Typhimurium UK - 1 8956 to obtain a HilA - overexpressing strain .
The strain was cultured in LB broth supplemented with L - arabinose ( 0.02 % ) and ampicillin ( 100 g/ml ) to induce the overexpression of HilA .
Means and standard deviations were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA ) , and the statistical significance was determined using the two - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) method in this software .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Csn - B and its derivatives inhibited the secretion of SPI - 1 effector proteins and invasion of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium into HeLa cells .
Our screening work was based on the fact that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium secreted SPI - 1 effector proteins into the culture supernatant when they were grown between 25 °C and 37 °C , the SPI - 1-induced condition in - vitro ( 36 ) .
INP0403 ( Fig. 1A ; see Scheme S1 in the supplemental material ) , which strongly affected T3SS of several Gram - negative bacteria ( 31 , 36 -- 39 ) , was chosen as the positive - control compound .
Through screening the chemical library of our laboratory by SDS - PAGE assay , we found that several compounds showed inhibitory effects on the secretion of SPI - 1 effectors ( data not shown ) .
Most interestingly , cytosporone B ( Csn - B ) , an octaketide , exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on the secretion of SPI - 1 effectors ( SipA , SipB , SipC , SipD ) without an evident effect on the flagellar protein FliC ( Fig. 1B and Table 2 ; see Fig .
S1 in the supplemental material ) .
Csn - B , isolated from the endophytic fungus Dothiorella sp. strain HTF3 , is a known agonist for nuclear orphan receptor Nur77 ( 52 , 53 ) .
Several Csn - B derivatives synthesized in our lab ( see Scheme S2 in the supplemental material ) also had this kind of inhibitory activity ( see Fig .
The identities of the protein bands in Fig. 1B , Fig. 2A , Fig. 3C , and Fig .
S1 were determined by protein molecular weights , Western blots , and review of the literature ( 54 ) .
The results ( Fig. 1A and B and Table 2 ) indicated that the alkyl chain linked to the ketone carbonyl group in Csn - B derivatives could be responsible for their activities on SPI - 1 .
However , compound - C8 , with nine carbon atoms linked to the ketone group , exhibited weaker activity than Csn - B ( Fig. 1A and B ) .
Moreover , the modification of the phenyl acetic acid ester group of Csn - B derivatives with methyl ester or carboxylic acid ( E0 E6 and A2 A5 ) ( see Fig .
S1 ) significantly decreased their effects , suggesting that the ester group may also be vital to the inhibitory effect .
Overall , Csn - B showed the best inhibitory activity against the secretion of SPI - 1 effectors .
The compounds with strong inhibitory effects on the secretion of SPI - 1 effectors were further evaluated in terms of their effects on SPI - 1-mediated invasion , as the invasion of Salmonella into host cells was predominately related to SPI - 1 ( 55 , 56 ) .
Because the invasion assay was cell based , we first determined the cytotoxicity of the compounds secocurvularin , C5 , and Csn - B on HeLa cells by MTT assay ( see Fig .
S2 in the supplemental material ) .
The MTT results showed that these three compounds had no obvious toxic effects on cell growth at various concentrations during a 4 - h incubation .
Then their inhibitory effects on the invasion of Salmonella into HeLa cells were assessed in a gentamicin protection assay ( Fig. 1C ) .
The results indicated that all three compounds inhibited bacterial invasion compared to the DMSO control .
As expected , their inhibitory activities in the invasion assay shared the same preliminary SAR as their effects on the secretion of SPI - 1 effectors revealed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting ( Fig. 1B ) .
Since all the results ( Fig. 1B and C ) showed that Csn - B exhibited May 2013 Volume 57 Number 5 aac.asm.org 2193 Li et al. .

Compounds were tested at a final concentration of 100 M. were all higher than 90 % , while those of 12.5 M and 6.25 M were substantially lower , only 78 % and 59 % , respectively ( Fig. 2A ) .
The results showed that Csn - B inhibited the secretion of SipC in a dose - dependent manner .
Moreover , the 50 % inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) of Csn - B was estimated to be less than 6.25 M , implying that Csn - B was a strong inhibitor of SPI - 1 .
On the other hand , Csn - B did not show an inhibitory effect on flagellar protein FliC , suggesting that Csn - B has no obvious influence on the flagella of the pathogen .
To determine whether the inhibitory activity of Csn - B on SPI - 1 resulted from directly killing the bacteria , the growth curve of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in LB broth was developed in the presence or absence of Csn - B at 100 M ( Fig. 2B ) .
No inhibitory effect on bacterial growth was observed at all time points examined ; instead , a modest promoting effect was observed .
Therefore , Csn - B at a final concentration of 100 M was adopted for further investigation to study the mechanism of Csn - B 's action on SPI - 1 .
Csn - B inhibited the secretion of SPI - 1 effectors through the Hha -- H - NS regulatory pathway .
The inhibitory level of Csn - B on SPI - 1 effectors in different fractions of bacterial culture was deeply investigated here .
A bacterial culture was fractionated into cell debris , culture supernatant , and intracellular fraction .
The results ( Fig. 3A ) showed that Csn - B significantly decreased SipC levels in different fractions of bacterial culture , while it did not obviously influence the level of flagellar protein FliC in all fractions .
It was speculated that the decrease of SipC level may be due to protein degradation or downregulation by Csn - B .
Different protease - inhibitors were added to bacterial culture fractions to identify whether or not the low SipC level resulted from degradation .
There was no significant difference observed between DMSO control and protease - inhibitor - treated samples ( see Fig .

Inhibition percentage was calculated by comparing the SipC blot with that of the DMSO control .
( B ) Csn - B at a concentration of 100 M did not significantly inhibit the bacterial growth .
SipC was significantly inhibited in both the Csn - B group and the Csn - B-plus - protease - inhibitor group ( see Fig .
The results suggested that the inhibitory effect of Csn - B on SPI - 1 effectors was unlikely to be due to protein degradation .
Instead , Csn - B is likely to affect the expression of SPI - 1 effectors , based on the results of Fig. 3A ( see Fig .
To further determine the mechanism of Csn - B 's action , the relative mRNA levels of several genes regulating the transcription of SPI - 1 were assessed by real - time qPCR ( Fig. 3B ) .
HilA , the key regulator of SPI - 1 , combining with the promoters of AraC - like regulator genes invF and sicA , directly activates the transcription of its downstream genes , such as SPI - 1 apparatus genes prg and FIG 3 Csn - B inhibited SPI - 1 effectors through the Hha -- H - NS regulatory pathway .

In addition , AraC - like proteins HilC , HilD , and RtsA form a feed - forward regulatory loop to control the transcription of hilA .
These three proteins can not only autoinduce the transcription of their genes , but also activate hilA independently ( 58 ) .
The mRNA levels of hilD , hilC , rtsA , and the downstream SPI - 1 genes were obviously higher in the DMSO group that was induced by temperature - change than in the noninduced DMSO group ( Fig. 3B ) , which suggested that temperature - change could activate the transcription of these genes .
The results ( Fig. 3B ) were consistent with the results described before ( 37 ) ; i.e. , temperature - change can induce expression of SPI - 1 effectors .
On the other hand , Csn - B exhibited a remarkable inhibitory effect on transcription of these genes compared with the DMSO control under induced conditions , which showed that Csn - B inhibited the transcription of these genes to reduce the expression of SPI - 1 effector proteins .
Furthermore , the effect of Csn - B on SPI - 1 was analyzed in a Salmonella strain recombinantly overexpressing HilA , the key regulatory factor of SPI - 1 .
No difference was observed ( Fig. 3C ) between the wild - type strain ( Salmonella 8956 ) and the HilA - overexpressing strain without L - arabinose induction , whereas the effector proteins SipA , SipB , SipC , and SipD were all upregulated in the HilA - overexpressing strain under the induction of 0.02 % L - arabinose ( Fig. 3C ) .
On the other hand , the FilC protein hardly exhibited any difference between groups ( Fig. 3C ) , which documented that HilA could not influence the expression of FliC .
Csn - B strongly decreased the level of SPI - 1 effectors in the HilAoverexpressing strain induced by L - arabinose , which further demonstrated that Csn - B inhibited the secretion of SPI - 1 effectors via affecting the expression of SPI - 1 regulator HilA ( Fig. 3C ) .
Interestingly , the positive - control compound INP0403 had an inhibitory effect on SPI - 1 effectors as strong as that of Csn - B in both the wild - type strain and the HilA - overexpressing strain without induction of L - arabinose , whereas it exerted a significantly weaker inhibition on SPI - 1 effectors in the HilA - overexpressing strain than Csn - B when induced by L - arabinose , which may suggest an INP0403 mechanism of inhibition other than the HilA pathway .
Because compound INP0010 ( D9 ) , the analog of INP0403 , could significantly affect transport of SPI - 1 effectors as well as transcription of SPI - 1 regulators ( 37 ) , with further analysis the result of this research ( Fig. 3C ) may lead to the discovery that INP0403 has the same mechanism of action as INP0010 .
Nucleoid proteins Hha and H - NS bond with the promoter regions of hilD , hilC , hilA , and rtsA to inhibit the transcription of SPI - 1 genes and expression of SPI - 1 effectors ( 59 ) .
In addition , proteins PhoP/and PhoQ directly or indirectly inhibit the transcription of hilA ( 60 , 61 ) .
Comparing the induced group with the noninduced group , the results ( Fig. 3B ) indicated that temperature change led to downregulation of transcription of hns and hha genes , but no significant influence on transcription of phoP and phoQ was found , suggesting that nucleoid protein complex Hha -- H - NS but not PhoP and PhoQ may be the predominant regulator of SPI - 1 effector genes under temperature - change .
Nucleoid protein Hha undergoes a conformational change when binding to H - NS to form heterocomplexes ( 59 , 62 ) , while a conformational change of the H - NS dimer from 25 °C to 37 °C promotes the transcription of a large number of SPI - 1-regulated genes ( 63 ) .
The results ( Fig. 3B ) were consistent with what was described in the literature ( 59 , 62 , 63 ) .
In this research , Csn - B evidently promoted the transcription of hns and hha , while it inhibited the transcription of phoP and phoQ ( Fig. 3B ) .
All in all , it could be concluded from the results ( Fig. 3A , B , and C ) that the Hha -- H - NS -- HilD -- HilC -- RtsA -- HilA pathway , not the PhoP - PhoQ pathway , may be the main regulatory pathway for Csn - B to exert its activity on SPI - 1 effector proteins ( Fig. 3D ) .
In this research , Csn - B and its derivatives exhibited inhibitory effects on the secretion of SPI - 1 effectors .
The preliminary SAR analysis suggested that the compounds with a long carbon chain and phenyl acetic acetate ester group could most likely result in strong activity .
Csn - B affected the transcription of SPI - 1-related genes through the Hha -- H - NS -- HilD -- HilC -- RtsA -- HilA regulatory pathway .
The results are important for understanding the molecular mechanism of these inhibitors ' action on T3SS .
Because T3SS is conserved in many Gram - negative pathogens , Csn - B and its derivatives may also have the same effect on other T3SSs .
Thus , Csn - B could be a useful lead compound for development of new antibiotics targeting T3SS .
