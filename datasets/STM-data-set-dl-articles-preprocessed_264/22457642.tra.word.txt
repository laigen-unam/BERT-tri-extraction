A Fundamental Regulatory Mechanism Operating through OmpR and DNA Topology Controls Expression of Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 Andrew D. S. Cameron $ , Charles J. Dorman * Department of Microbiology , Moyne Institute of Preventive Medicine , School of Genetics and Microbiology , Trinity College Dublin , Dublin , Ireland Abstract DNA topology has fundamental control over the ability of transcription factors to access their target DNA sites at gene promoters .
However , the influence of DNA topology on protein -- DNA and protein -- protein interactions is poorly understood .
For example , relaxation of DNA supercoiling strongly induces the well - studied pathogenicity gene ssrA ( also called spiR ) in Salmonella enterica , but neither the mechanism nor the proteins involved are known .
We have found that relaxation of DNA supercoiling induces expression of the Salmonella pathogenicity island ( SPI ) -2 regulator ssrA as well as the SPI - 1 regulator hilC through a mechanism that requires the two - component regulator OmpR - EnvZ .
Additionally , the ompR promoter is autoregulated in the same fashion .
Conversely , the SPI - 1 regulator hilD is induced by DNA relaxation but is repressed by OmpR .
Relaxation of DNA supercoiling caused an increase in OmpR binding to DNA and a concomitant decrease in binding by the nucleoid - associated protein FIS .
The reciprocal occupancy of DNA by OmpR and FIS was not due to antagonism between these transcription factors , but was instead a more intrinsic response to altered DNA topology .
Surprisingly , DNA relaxation had no detectable effect on the binding of the global repressor H - NS .
These results reveal the underlying molecular mechanism that primes SPI genes for rapid induction at the onset of host invasion .
Additionally , our results reveal novel features of the archetypal two - component regulator OmpR .
OmpR binding to relaxed DNA appears to generate a locally supercoiled state , which may assist promoter activation by relocating supercoiling stress - induced destabilization of DNA strands .
Much has been made of the mechanisms that have evolved to regulate horizontally - acquired genes such as SPIs , but parallels among the ssrA , hilC , and ompR promoters illustrate that a fundamental form of regulation based on DNA topology coordinates the expression of these genes regardless of their origins .

* E - mail : cjdorman@tcd.ie $ Current address : Department of Biology , University of Regina , Regina , Canada Introduction Salmonella enterica is a facultative intracellular pathogen of the mammalian gut .
After passing through the diverse environments of the stomach and digestive tract , S. enterica can invade host epithelial cells to gain access to internal tissues where it can persist inside macrophage [ 1 ] .
The Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 ( SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 ) encode type three secretion systems ( T3SS ) and effector proteins that enable the manipulation and invasion of host tissues [ 2,3 ] .
SPI - 1 genes are expressed primarily in the intestine during the early stages of invasion , followed by a decrease in SPI - 1 expression and an increase in SPI - 2 expression inside epithelial cells , and finally SPI - 2 expression predominates once S. enterica has crossed the epithelium and resides in macrophage vacuoles [ 4 ] .
Despite this apparently reciprocal pattern of expression over the course of invasion , both gene islands are coregulated by many of the same global regulatory proteins .
For example , SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes are strongly repressed by the nucleoid - associated protein H - NS , a highly - abundant protein that blocks and traps RNA polymerase at gene promoters by forming repressive nucleoprotein complexes [ 5,6 ] .
SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 also share the transcriptional activators FIS and OmpR .
FIS is required for full activation of both SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes in laboratory conditions [ 7 ] , and Dfis mutants are attenuated for virulence in mice [ 8 ] and show reduced survival in macrophage [ 9 ] .
OmpR is a well - characterized direct transcriptional activator of the SPI - 2 ssrAB promoter [ 10 ] , and DompR mutants are attenuated [ 11 ] , but the role of OmpR in SPI - 1 gene expression has remained ambiguous [ 2 ] .
It has been recently discovered that together OmpR and FIS drive low - level transcription of SPI - 2 in the intestinal lumen , an environment classically thought to be the exclusive domain of SPI - 1 [ 12 ] .
By regulating expression of SPI - encoded transcription factors , H - NS , FIS , OmpR , and other global regulators sit atop a hierarchical network that integrates diverse environmental and physiological cues .
SPI - encoded transcription factors fine - tune these global inputs to control precisely the dosage of T3SS and effector protein production [ 13 ] .
SPI - 1 encodes four AraC - like transcription factors : HilA , HilC , HilD , InvF .
Through a complex feedback and feedforward mechanism , HilC and HilD PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 1 March 2012  Volume 8  Issue 3  e1002615 Salmonella SPI Gene Regulation Author Summary DNA is often considered to be a passive carrier of genetic information , but in fact DNA is an active participant in coordinating the expression of the genes it carries .
This is because DNA is a dynamic molecule that can assume a wide range of topologies , and this has a direct impact on the formation of the protein -- DNA complexes that drive gene expression .
In a bacterium , the chromosome is supercoiled to variable levels according to environmental conditions , and supercoiling in turn governs the topology of gene promoters .
Thus DNA supercoiling is able to transduce environmental signals to regulate promoter output .
A previous study found that the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica may use changes in DNA supercoiling to detect when it has entered host immune cells , allowing the bacterium to induce the pathogenicity genes it requires to evade killing by macrophage .
In dissecting the underlying molecular mechanisms , we have found that changes in DNA supercoiling also upregulate other key pathogenicity genes , and we have identified the proteins involved in this gene regulatory process .
These findings indicate that a fundamental level of gene control arising from the interplay between protein transcription factors and DNA topology regulates Salmonella pathogenicity .
control their own and each other 's transcription , and together activate transcription of hilA [ 14,15,16 ] ( Figure 1A ) .
HilA in turn activates invF and the genes encoding the T3SS and effector proteins [ 17 ] .
Additionally , there is crosstalk between SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 through which HilD induces expression of ssrAB [ 18 ] ( Figure 1A ) .
Unlike SPI - 1 , SPI - 2 encodes a single cognate regulator .
Here , an unidentified signal causes the sensor kinase SsrA to phosphorylate the DNA binding protein SsrB , which in turn activates transcription of SPI - 2 T3SS and effector genes [ 3 ] .
SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 are among the best - studied genetic systems in bacteriology , yet their complex regulation has meant that the mechanisms that integrate the myriad of regulatory signals have remained enigmatic .
Even less clear are the contributions made by DNA topology to the interactions and architecture of the nucleoprotein complexes that form at SPI promoters .
Several lines of evidence implicate altered DNA supercoiling in coordinating SPI gene expression during invasion .
The invA gene in SPI - 1 , which encodes an effector protein , is repressed by relaxed DNA supercoiling [ 19 ] .
Conversely , ssrA expression is induced by relaxation of DNA supercoiling [ 9 ] .
S. enterica DNA is highly supercoiled in low oxygen environments but is more relaxedinoxygenatedconditions , andthismayreflecttheDNA supercoiling dynamics that occur as S. enterica approaches the aerobic region immediately adjacent to the intestinal epithelium [ 20,21 ] .
In tissue culture , S. enterica DNA supercoiling appears to remain static in epithelial cells but is dynamic when the bacterium resides inside macrophage [ 9 ] , which demonstrates the complexity of S. enterica 's interactions with host environments .
Our investigation of the links between environment , DNA supercoiling , and gene expression has uncovered a fundamental mechanism of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulation in which relaxation of DNA supercoiling recruits OmpR to the ssrA , hilC , andhilD promoters , and this level of control functions independently of the fine - tuning effected by SPI - encoded transcription factors .

g001 PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 2 March 2012  Volume 8  Issue 3  e1002615 Salmonella SPI Gene Regulation Results Induction of SPI genes by DNA relaxation requires specific transcription factors The ssrAB promoter ( P ssrA ) is induced by novobiocin , an aminocoumarin antibiotic that specifically inhibits the DNA supercoiling activity of the DNA gyrase subunit B ( GyrB ) ( Figure 1B ) .
In contrast , the SPI - 2 T3SS and effector gene promoters , ssaB - E , sseA - G , ssaG - L , andssaM - R , are only very slightly induced by altered DNA topology and the presumed increase in SsrA and SsrB concentrations brought about by novobiocin treatment ( Figure S1A ) .
Thus , the ability of DNA relaxation to activate SPI - 2 is channeled through the cognate SsrA/B two - component regulator .
P ssrA induction was reduced in cells lacking FIS , a master regulator of DNA supercoiling ( Figure 1B ) , possibly because novobiocin has a reduced effect on DNA supercoiling in Dfis mutants compared to wild type cells [ 20 ] .
Unlike FIS , OmpR and its phospo - donor EnvZ were both absolutely required for induction of P ssrA , suggestingthatrelaxed DNA supercoiling alone can not activate P ssrA in the absence of OmpR 's ability to recruit RNAP .
The requirement for EnvZ indicates that OmpR must be phosphorylated in order to stimulate these promoters , and also indicates that other phospho - donors do not activate OmpR in these conditions .
The SPI - encoded regulators HilD and SsrA/B played no detectable role in P ssrA induction .
The alternate sigma factor RpoS is better at transcribing relaxed DNA than is the primary housekeeping sigma factor RpoD [ 22 ] , and the elevated level of RpoS during stationary - phase correlates with ssrA expression in standard laboratory conditions , but deletion of rpoS did not reduce P ssrA induction by novobiocin ( Figure S1B ) .
Previous experiments in S. enterica have shown that the ompRenvZ promoter ( P ompR ) is induced by high concentrations of novobiocin at late stages of growth , and that OmpR is an autoregulator of this induction [ 23 ] .
We found that P ompR is also activated by low concentrations of novobiocin during exponential growth , and FIS and OmpR - EnvZ contribute to this induction ( Figure 1B ) .
Deletion of hilD did not affect P ompR induction .
However , P ompR activity was unexpectedly elevated in the DssrA/B mutant , suggesting that SsrA/B may directly or indirectly regulate ompR expression .
Because SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes are usually observed to have inverse expression patterns , we expected SPI - 1 genes to be insensitive or repressed by DNA relaxation .
We tested the effects of novobiocin treatment on expression of the master regulators hilA , hilC , and hilD , and were surprised to find that both the hilC and hilD promoters ( P hilC and P hilD ) were induced by DNA relaxation ( Figure 1B ) .
P hilA was insensitive to DNA relaxation ( Figure S1A ) , suggesting that the inducing signal is limited to P hilC and P hilD ( Figure 1A ) .
Like P ssrA , P hilC required both FIS and OmpR - EnvZ for induction ; yet unlike P ssrA , the absence of FIS was not compensated by increasing concentrations of novobiocin .
Consistent with its role as a transcriptional activator , HilD was required for full activation of P hilC ( Figure 1B ) .
SsrA/B did not contribute to P hilC induction .
P hilD was unique among the four promoters in having higher expression in the absence of ompR and envZ , but it nevertheless required FIS for full activation ( Figure 1B ) .
P hilD induction was unaffected by the absence of SsrA/B or HilD .
Quantitative PCR measurement of ssrA , ompR , hilC , hilD , and hilA mRNA levels confirmed the results obtained from the reporter gene fusions ( Figure S1C ) .
OmpR requires DNA relaxation to stimulate transcription Having found that OmpR and relaxed DNA supercoiling work in concert to stimulate transcription from P ssrA , P hilC , and P ompR , we wished to test the relative contributions of OmpR and DNA topology to promoter function .
To this end , the ompR - envZ operon ( ompB ) was cloned under the control of the arabinose - inducible P BAD promoter in a DompB mutant .
P ssrA expression increased only very slightly when ompB was overexpressed ( 0.2 % arabinose ) in the absence of DNA relaxation ( Figure 2 ) .
In contrast , DNA relaxation in the complete absence of OmpR ( empty pBAD vector ) had a stimulatory effect on P ssrA ; this activation was higher in cells carrying pBADompB , likely due to leaky transcription of ompB in the absence - of - arabinose .
The combination of ompB overexpression and DNA relaxation had the strongest stimulatory effect , confirming that OmpR and DNA relaxation work in concert to activate P ssrA .
The combination of ompB over - expression and DNA relaxation also resulted in maximal expression of P hilC and P ompR , however the effect was more subtle for P hilC ( Figure 2 ) .
Consistent with the results presented in Figure 1B , P hilD was repressed by ompB expression , and this repression occurred in both the absence and presence of DNA relaxation .
Repression of P hilD was strongest at the lower concentration of novobiocin ( 15 mg/ml ) , raising the possibility that a high degree of DNA relaxation reduces repression by OmpR , perhaps through elevated HilC levels brought about by DNA relaxation ( Figure 1A ) .
OmpR binding to SPI - 1 promoters The control of hilC and hilD expression by OmpR suggested that OmpR may regulate these genes through direct interactions .
Electrophoretic mobility - shift ( bandshift ) assays confirmed that OmpR binds specifically to both P hilC and P hilD , with OmpR demonstrating an affinity for P hilC similar to that for the positive control P ompC ( Figure 3A ) .
A negative control bait DNA ( kan ) was not bound specifically by OmpR at the concentrations tested .
In these equilibrium binding assays , the rapid appearance of OmpR - DNA complexes over a small range of protein concentrations was evidence of cooperative OmpR binding to the bait DNA .
Moreover , OmpR - DNA complexes demonstrated slower migration at higher OmpR concentrations , indicating that multiple Figure 2 .

g003 OmpR molecules were bound to a single bait DNA molecule .
Cooperative DNA binding is a feature common among NAPs -- like FIS and H - NS -- that bind with low - specificity to multiple proximal DNA sites [ 24,25 ] .
Indeed , OmpR monomers are thought to first bind cooperatively to form a nucleating dimer that recruits additional OmpR dimers in a cooperative fashion [ 26 ] .
DNase footprinting revealed that P hilC and P hilD each have a single region protected by OmpR ( Figure 3B ) .
The P hilC region bound by OmpR is located over 100 bp upstream of the hilC start codon , consistent with OmpR 's function as a transcriptional activator of this promoter .
Conversely , the OmpR - protected region of P hilD is downstream of the hilD start codon , where OmpR binding is likely to have a repressive effect on hilD transcription .
Promoter occupancy If OmpR function is enhanced by relaxation of DNA supercoiling , does DNA relaxation result in increased DNA binding by OmpR ?
This was tested by quantifying OmpR binding to gene promoters in - vivo using chromatin immuno - precipitation ( ChIP ) .
A fusion of the 36 - Flag epitope tag to the C - terminus of OmpR was used for these experiments .
The epitope tag added 22 amino - acids adjacent to OmpR 's DNA - binding domain and created a new ribosome binding site for the envZ open reading frame ; nonetheless , cells with OmpR : Flag showed only a slight reduction in promoter activation by novobiocin ( Figure S1C ) .
Alternatively , a 36Flag tag at the N - terminus of OmpR could not be used because it generated a DompR phenotype at promoters ( not shown ) .
Novobiocin treatment caused a significant increase in OmpR occupancy at P ssrA , P ompR , P hilC , and P hilD ( Figure 4A ) .
Increased promoter occupancy was due solely to a change in binding activity as OmpR levels were observed to decrease after novobiocin treatment ( Figure 4B ) .
Because OmpR requires DNA relaxation for it to be fully active at SPI promoters ( Figure 2 ) , we predicted that OmpR is an ineffective antagonist of H - NS binding and thus requires novobiocin - induced changes in DNA topology to assist in H - NS displacement .
Our H - NS ChIP results confirm earlier studies that have found H - NS to occupy SPI promoters , but demonstrates a low affinity for P ompR [ 5,27 ] ( Figure 4A ) .
Surprisingly , at all four promoters H - NS abundance was not affected by DNA relaxation nor by increased OmpR binding .
It is important to note however that while ChIP quantifies protein abundance at genomic regions at a resolution around 500 bp , ChIP does not resolve changes to higher - order protein complexes if protein abundance remains constant .
Therefore , we can not rule out that although H - NS is not displaced , promoter activity may increase because H - NS oligomers are restructured by OmpR binding as well as by changes in DNA topology .
Chromatin immuno - precipitation of FIS fused to a 86Myc epitope tag has been used previously to examine genome - wide FIS binding in E. coli [ 28 ] .
We constructed an identical FIS : Myc fusion protein in S. enterica and used this to measure FIS occupancy of gene promoters in our experimental conditions .
This revealed a high abundance of FIS at the SPI promoters , with slightly less FIS bound to P ompR ( Figure 4A ) .
At all loci tested , FIS occupancy decreased when cells were treated with novobiocin .
This reduced FIS occupancy can be explained mostly by the ,50 % decrease in FIS levels in novobiocin - treated cells ( Figure 4B ) .
Although FIS contributes to transcriptional activation of these promoters , the finding that transcriptional activation occurs even when FIS is depleted suggests that FIS may act in part through its global control of DNA topology .
Because FIS transitions from a filamentous DNA - binding mode to an ordered dimer as its concentration decreases [ 24 ] , it is also possible that the depletion of FIS coupled with changes in DNA topology restructures FIS complexes into forms that favour transcription activation .
We next tested whether the decrease in promoter activity observed in a Dfis mutant ( Figure 1B ) was due to a reduced ability by OmpR to access gene promoters .
The ChIP data suggest that both OmpR and H - NS have less access to promoter DNA in a Dfis mutant ( Figure 4A ) .
We have previously found that the Dfis mutant is resistant to relaxation of DNA supercoiling by novobiocin [ 20 ] .
It may be that H - NS and OmpR require DNA relaxation to gain full access to P ssrA , P ompR , P hilC , and P hilD , and the degree of relaxation is too modest in the Dfis mutant .
Nevertheless , novobiocin treatment caused a small increase in OmpR occupancy in Dfis mutants , indicating that OmpR binding does not absolutely require the topological constraints imposed on DNA by FIS binding .
The same experiment was conducted in a DompR mutant .
In the absence of OmpR , novobiocin treatment caused a reduction in FIS binding ( Figure 4A ) , again consistent with a reduction in FIS levels in these cells ( Figure 4B ) .
Although less H - NS bound to SPI promoters in the DompR mutant , significantly more H - NS bound to P ompR , suggesting that OmpR is an effective H - NS antagonist at its own promoter .
Surprisingly , the reduced H - NS levels observed in the DompR mutant ( Figure 4B ) , along with the further reduction in H - NS levels upon novobiocin treatment , implicates OmpR as a regulator of hns expression .
Regulation in a Dhns mutant Because DNA relaxation does not appear to displace H - NS from gene promoters , we tested how removing H - NS from the system affects promoter function .
Although all four test promoters had a similar pattern of induction by DNA relaxation in wild type cells , contrasting responses were observed in the absence of H - NS .
As expected , all three SPI promoters were strongly upregulated ( 20 to 200 - fold ) in the Dhns mutant ( Figure 4C ) .

g004 NS , ssrA was induced , hilC was repressed , and hilD was unaffected by DNA relaxation .
These contrasting responses may result from the different and complex regulatory inputs acting at each promoter , and further confirm that promoter induction by DNA relaxation is not due simply to antagonism of H - NS repression .
Transcriptional output from P ompR was the same in wild type and Dhns mutant cells in normal growth - conditions ( Figure 4C ) .
This finding that H - NS does not repress P ompR is consistent with the low affinity of H - NS for this promoter ( Figure 4A ) .
Surprisingly though , P ompR was not induced by novobiocin in the Dhns mutant , which may be indirectly caused by the highly pleiotropic effects of the Dhns mutation .
OmpR constrains a supercoiled - like state To determine how DNA supercoiling affects OmpR affinity for DNA , we used primer - extension to resolve DNase footprints on supercoiled and linear DNA templates .
This approach can also determine if OmpR binds to different target sites depending on DNA supercoiling state , thus P ompR was used as the target DNA in this set of experiments because it has multiple , clearly delineated OmpR binding sites [ 23 ] .
The grey filled boxes in Figure 5A highlight the regions of P ompR protected from DNase I digestion by OmpR .
Most protection in the absence of supercoiling ( linear DNA ) was observed at a 60 bp region , OmpR - 2 , with lesser protection of regions on either side .
Protected regions were assigned numbers to correspond with the OmpR sites identified previously by Bang et al. [ 23 ] ( horizontal , dark - grey lines ) .
Unlike Bang et al. [ 23 ] , we analyzed OmpR binding to the full P ompR intergenic region to resolve a more promoter - distal site , OmpR - 4 .
DNase I digestion of an end - labeled linear template confirmed that OmpR - 2 is the primary site of OmpR binding to P ompR ( Figure S2A ) .
As supercoiling levels increased , protection by OmpR appeared to decrease ( Figure 5A ) , giving the impression that OmpR binds DNA better at lower supercoiling levels .
However , this result was caused by a decrease in DNase I cutting of unprotected supercoiled DNA , perhaps due to DNA compaction and the loss of B - DNA conformation at higher superhelical densities .
The amount of DNase I digestion in the presence of OmpR was consistent regardless of the superhelical density of P ompR DNA .
Thus , OmpR may reduce DNase I digestion across the entire promoter region by constraining a supercoiled - like state in DNA , as has been observed for FIS and H - NS [ 29,30 ] .
DNA positions that are hypersensitive to endonuclease cutting offer additional insight into changes in DNA topology .
For example , positions 2207 and 2182 became less sensitive whereas positions 2154 and 29 became increasingly sensitive to DNase I digestion as supercoiling increased .
Position 2154 ( marked with an asterisk ) is particularly intriguing because it was ultrahypersensitive to DNase I digestion when DNA was supercoiled .
When DNA was fully relaxed , OmpR binding greatly enhanced DNase I cutting at position 2154 , supporting a model in which OmpR binding creates DNA structures similar to those induced by negative DNA supercoiling .
DNA supercoiling exerts torsional stress that weakens base pairing , and so reduces the amount of energy needed for DNA melting and transcription initiation .
This is referred to as stressinduced duplex destabilization ( SIDD ) , and the energy required for strand separation at each base pair in a specific sequence , G ( x ) , can be predicted for different superhelical densities [ 31 ] .
Stable base pairs have G ( x ) values around 10 , whereas lower values indicate positions prone to SIDD .
We used WebSIDD [ 32 ] to predict the stability of P ompR DNA at the approximate superhelical densities observed during exponential - growth ( s = 20.06 ) and after treatment with 15 mg/ml novobiocin ( s = 20.045 ) .
The G ( x ) profiles of P ompR at both superhelical densities revealed a highly destabilized region ranging from positions 270 to 2160 , with a weakly destabilized region ( 220 to 255 ) encompassing the ompR transcription start sites ( Figure 5B ) .
This analysis makes the counterintuitive prediction that P ompR becomes increasingly PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 5 March 2012  Volume 8  Issue 3  e1002615 Salmonella SPI Gene Regulation Figure 5 .

B ) SIDD profile of P ompR in pZec - PompR at two superhelical densities .
To detect long range effects of DNA supercoiling , WebSIDD [ 32 ] uses a default 5 kbp window that slides by 500 bp , thus each base pair is considered 10 times and the G ( x ) is calculated by weighting the effects of proximal bases .
G ( x ) is expressed in kcal/mol/bp .
Grey arrows indicate transcription start sites ( TSS ) , mapped in [ 23 ] .
g005 destabilized as DNA relaxes , which is nevertheless consistent with the observed gene activation in these conditions ( Figure 1B ) .
DNA upstream of position 2170 is highly stable , indicating that the destabilization effect is specific and concentrated at the main binding site used by OmpR .
The primary OmpR binding sites , OmpR - 1 and OmpR - 2 , cover most of the highly destabilized regions , raising the possibility that OmpR binding transmits the destabilizing force to the adjacent RNA polymerase binding site where DNA strand separation can assist in transcription initiation .
A similar SIDD - transmission function has been characterized for FIS and IHF [ 33 ] .
Novobiocin treatment caused the same degree of DNA relaxation in DompR mutant cells as in wild type cells ( Figure S2B ) .
This suggests that promoter DNA experiences the same stress - induced strand destabilization in both mutant and wild type , indicating that reduced promoter activation in the DompR mutant ( Figure 1B ) is due to the absence of OmpR binding , not an altered degree of DNA relaxation .
In other words , DNA strand destabilization caused by DNA supercoiling is insufficient for P ompR activation in the absence of OmpR binding .
Discussion S. enterica traverses various extracellular and intracellular environments during infection of host tissues , thus it requires genetic programs capable of balancing shifting requirements for the T3SS and effector proteins that mediate the invasion process .
Two recent studies unexpectedly discovered that SPI - 2 genes are expressed in the mouse intestinal lumen prior to cellular invasion , leading to the hypotheses that SPI - 2 is either important for colonization of the intestine or requires priming before intracellular invasion [ 12,34 ] .
SPI - 2 expression during - growth in rich medium , which roughly mimics conditions in the intestinal lumen , requires OmpR and FIS but is independent of SsrB , SlyA , and PhoP [ 12,18 ] .
Here we describe a fundamental mechanism that activates both SPI - 2 and SPI - 1 promoters through changes in DNA topology , and this mechanism depends on OmpR and FIS but is independent of SsrB and HilD .
It is intriguing that P ssrA induction does not require FIS in culture conditions that mimic the vacuolar environment [ 12 ] , nor is FIS required for P ssrA induction when DNA is highly relaxed [ 20 ] .
These findings support a model in which fine - tuning of SPI gene expression by factors such as SsrB , HilD , SlyA , and PhoP may occur primarily in the vacuolar environment .
Although OmpR - EnvZ is the archetypal two component signal transduction pathway , the environmental stimulus of EnvZ kinase activity remains unclear [ 35 ] , and this stimulus appears to differ between E. coli and S. enterica [ 36 ] .
It is perhaps for this reason that a role for OmpR in the regulation of SPI - 1 has been enigmatic .
Previous studies have found no effect or only weak effects from deletion of ompR or envZ .
It was initially proposed that OmpR - EnvZ directly controls hilC expression [ 37 ] , but others have favoured a model in which OmpR somehow acts post - transcriptionally through HilD protein function [ 2 ] .
Here we provide evidence that under conditions of relaxed DNA supercoiling , OmpR binds directly to both the hilC and hilD promoters where it activates the former and represses the latter .
There is a growing body of evidence that in addition to the classic role of OmpR as a site - specific transcription factor that activates gene expression through RNAP recruitment , it also exhibits NAP - like features and functions .
Because OmpR makes few specific contacts with DNA , it demonstrates an affinity for non - specific DNA [ 38,39 ] .
The preferred OmpR target sites , which are highly degenerate at the sequence level , may serve as nucleating points for cooperative recruitment of additional OmpR molecules .
Nucleation and cooperative DNA binding can explain the broad regions of OmpR protection observed at P hilC ( Figure 3B ) , P ompR ( Figure 5A ) , and P ssrA [ 10 ] .
Additionally , our ChIP data revealed OmpR binding to regions not predicted to be specific targets ( Figure S2C ) .
This is similar to the ChIP survey of cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) targets in E. coli which revealed a high background of CRP binding across the entire chromosome [ 40 ] .
CRP binding to thousands of weak sites lead the authors to propose that this archetypal transcription factor should also be considered as a chromosome - structuring protein .
An additional interesting parallel between OmpR and CRP is that both are calculated to have similar cellular concentrations : ,3,000 CRP and ,3,500 OmpR molecules/cell [ 41,42 ] .
Thus , both OmpR and CRP may represent a class of NAP - like DNA - binding proteins whose high abundance allows them to have a broad influence on chromosome shape and function , yet whose modulation through allosteric effectors generates titratable DNA - binding modes that preferentially target specific promoters .
The discovery that DNA relaxation results in increased OmpR binding to DNA in - vivo presents an intriguing model in which this mechanism is complementary to phosphorylation of OmpR by EnvZ as a means to stimulate OmpR - DNA binding .
Thus , phosphorylated OmpR may be recruited to promoters by DNA relaxation .
Future global analysis of OmpR binding to the S. enterica PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 6 March 2012  Volume 8  Issue 3  e1002615 Salmonella SPI Gene Regulation chromosome will shed light on the relative contributions of phosphorylation and DNA relaxation to OmpR - DNA interactions .
Whole - genome analysis of the transcriptional consequences of DNA relaxation in E. coli revealed that relaxation - induced promoters are significantly more A+T - rich than are uninduced promoters [ 43 ] .
Because H - NS preferentially binds to regions of high A+T content , relaxation - induced promoters are very likely to be H - NS repressed .
In E. coli , the OmpR targets P ompR and P ompC were induced whereas P ompF was repressed by novobiocin [ 43 ] , and we found the same response in S. enterica ( Figure S2D ) .
This shared response of OmpR - regulated genes to novobiocin in E. coli and S. enterica coupled with the proposed ability of DNA relaxation to weaken H - NS repression hints at an evolutionarily conserved gene regulatory mechanism that predates horizontal acquisition of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 by Salmonella .
Transcriptional activators of SPI genes ( HilC , HilD , SsrB , and SlyA ) function in large part through displacement of H - NS from SPI promoters [ 16,44 ] .
Members of the AraC - like protein family , which includes HilC and HilD , have a well - documented ability to displace H - NS [ 45 ] .
SsrB , a member of the NarL protein family , activates transcription by displacing H - NS but does not appear able to break H - NS bridges [ 44 ] .
OmpR and SlyA are wingedhelix DNA binding proteins .
Like OmpR , SlyA relieves H - NS repression without displacing H - NS [ 46 ] ; SlyA also generates regions of DNase I hypersensitivity , thus may have a topological restructuring mode that contributes to breaking H - NS bridges [ 46 ] .
However , unlike OmpR , SlyA relies on activators such as PhoP to recruit RNAP .
Variable modes of H - NS antagonism -- from anti - polymerization by HilD , HilC , and SsrB to anti - bridging by OmpR and SlyA -- may represent a gate - keeper mechanism that selects which of the numerous regulators known to act at SPI gene promoters are allowed access to their target DNA sites , thus fine - tuning transcriptional output .
Materials and Methods Strains Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 was used for all experiments .
Detailed descriptions of mutant strains used in this study are provided in Table S1 .
E. coli XL - 1 blue was used for all cloning steps .
Mutant construction Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1 .
To generate S. enterica mutants , the kanamycin resistance cassette was PCR amplified from pKD4 [ 47 ] using primers listed in Table S2 , which were designed to replace only open reading frames .
Because the ompR and envZ open reading frames overlap , special care was taken to preserve open reading frames when constructing deletion and epitope - fusion mutations .
PCR amplicons were spin column purified then transformed into electrocompetent S. enterica SL1344 containing the Red helper plasmid pKD46 as previously described [ 47,48 ] .
Mutations were transduced into a fresh SL1344 background by bacteriophage P22 generalized transduction [ 49 ] , then were confirmed by DNA sequencing .
Site - directed mutagenesis of the ompB locus cloned in pUC18 was carried out using the QuikChange II kit ( Stratagene ) and primers listed in Table S2 , following the manufacturer 's protocol .
Cloning Transcriptional reporter fusions were constructed by cloning gene promoters in pZep and pZec vectors , which contain a promoterless gfp + gene [ 20,50 ] .
The cat gene was removed from pZep to generate pZec so that transcriptional reporter fusions could be cloned in cells containing pBAD .
The removal of the cat gene from pZep to generate pZec had no effect on expression of cloned promoters ( not shown ) .
Data presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2 is from cells carrying pZec reporter plasmids .
pZep or and pZec plasmids were digested with SmaI and XbaI , spin column purified using the HiYield PCR DNA Fragment Extraction Kit ( RBC Bioscience ) , and dephosphorylated with Antarctic Phosphatase ( New England Biolabs ) .
Gene promoter sequences were PCR amplified using the Phusion DNA polymerase ( NEB ) and primers listed in Table S2 .
SmaI and XbaI digested amplicons were spin column purified , then ligated to pZep or pZec by T4 ligase ( Roche ) .
The exception was the ompR promoter region which was digested with NotI and XbaI before cloning into similarly digested vector .
The ompB locus along with its native ribosome binding site was PCR amplified using primers listed in Table S2 , followed by PstI and SacI digestion and spin column purification .
PstI and SacI digested pBAD33 was gel purified , de - phosphorylated by Antarctic Phosphatase ( NEB ) , then ligated to the digested PCR amplicon .
The effects of inducible ompB on promoter function were assessed by measuring GFP levels in cells carrying both pBADompB and pZec transcriptional reporter clones .
Arabinose and novobiocin were added to cultures at the concentrations indicated in Figure 2 .
Culture conditions and novobiocin treatment Cells were cultured in a shaking waterbath at 37uC in LB ( 1 % tryptone and 0.5 % yeast extract ) without any NaCl added .
Cells used for gfp reporter fusion experiments were cultured in 4 ml of LB in glass tubes ( interior diameter 14 mm ) shaking at 200 RPM whereas cells used for ChIP and quantitative PCR experiments were cultured in 55 ml of LB in 250 ml glass flasks shaking at 140 RPM .
Previous studies testing the effects of novobiocin on gene expression in S. enterica have used high concentrations of novobiocin ( 25 -- 150 mg/ml ) in cells transitioning from late exponential to stationary - phase physiology [ 9,23 ] , thus introducing additional variables arising from growth phase transitions .
To ensure a steady state of growth , we conducted all experiments using cells that had been growing exponentially for more than six doublings at low cell density ( OD 600 less than 0.3 ) .
In addition , we used low concentrations of novobiocin ( 15 -- 25 mg/ml ) to minimize effects on growth - rate .
Cells were fixed after 3 hrs of continued growth at low density in the presence or absence of novobiocin ( final OD 600 0.1 -- 0.25 ) , as in [ 20 ] .
Quantitative PCR measurement of gene expression Total RNA was isolated from cultures using the SV Total RNA Isolation System ( Promega ) and purity and quality was assessed by electrophoresis in 1 % agarose ( 16TAE ) .
For each sample , 5 mg total RNA was DNase treated in a 50 - ml reaction using the Turbo DNA - free kit ( AMBION ) , and cDNA templates were synthesized by random priming 0.5 mg RNA in a 20 ml reaction using the GoScrip Reverse Transcription System ( Promega ) .
Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) primers are listed in Table S2 .
PCR reactions were carried out in duplicate with each primer set on an ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System ( Applied Biosystems ) using FastStart SYBR Green Master with ROX ( Roche ) .
Standard curves were included in every qPCR run ; standard curves were generated for each primer set using five serial tenfold dilutions of S. enterica chromosomal DNA .
Chromatin immuno - precipitation ( ChIP ) ChIP was conducted as previously described [ 27 ] .
Two ChIP replicates were performed using a strain containing both the PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 7 March 2012  Volume 8  Issue 3  e1002615 Salmonella SPI Gene Regulation ompR : flag and fis : myc epitope fusions , allowing for simultaneous precipitation of OmpR : Flag , Fis : Myc , and H - NS from the same biological sample .
One ChIP replicate was conducted for each strain carrying a single epitope tag ( ompR : flag or fis : myc ) .
ChIP results overlapped between the double and single fusion strains , indicating that the epitope - tagged proteins did not negatively affect nucleoprotein interactions when combined .
Precipitated DNA was quantified by quantitative PCR using primers listed in Table S2 .
Western blot analysis Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 16Laemmli buffer ( 4 % SDS , 20 % glycerol , 10 % 2 - mercaptoethanol , 0.004 % bromophenol blue , 0.125 M Tris HCl , pH 6.8 ) and denatured at 100uC for 5 min .
Samples were electrophoresed on 15 % polyacrylamide SDS gels .
Gels and nitrocellulose membranes were equilibrated in transfer buffer ( 25 mM Tris HCl , 192 mM glycine , 0.02 % SDS , 20 % methanol ) and proteins were transferred to membranes at 150 V for 90 min using a Trans - blot ( BioRad ) apparatus packed in ice .
Membranes were blocked overnight at 4uC in 5 % non - fat powdered milk in PBS ( 137 mM NaCl , 12 mM Phosphate , 2.7 mM KCl , pH 7.4 ) , followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 hr with rocking in primary antibodies diluted as follows : 1/100 ,000 anti - DnaK mAb rabbit ( Enzo Life Sciences ) , 1/10 ,000 anti - FLAG mAb rabbit ( Sigma ) , 1/10 ,000 anti - Myc mAb rabbit ( Sigma ) , and 1/5 ,000 anti - H-NS polyclonal mouse [ 5 ] .
Blots were washed thoroughly and probed with horseradish peroxidase - linked anti - rabbit and anti - mouse antibodies ( Millipore ) diluted 1/5 ,000 in PBS ( 1 % blocking agent ) for 1 hr at room temperature with rocking , followed by thorough washing .
Blots were incubated in ECL reagent ( Pierce ) for 1 min , and bands were visualized using an ImageQuant LAS 4000 scanner ( GE Healthcare ) then quantified using ImageJ v1 .43 ( National Institutes of Health , U.S.A. ) .
Probing for all proteins ( DnaK , FIS : Myc , H - NS , and OmpR : Flag ) simultaneously on the same blot allowed for protein quantities to be normalized to the internal standard ( DnaK ) and expressed relative to one another .
Each cell sample was run on three independent western blots to improve the accuracy of quantification .
Thus , the protein abundance value for each biological replicate is the average value from three replicate blots .
OmpR purification The OmpR D55E mutation creates a constitutively active protein by mimicking phosphorylation [ 51 ] .
OmpR ( D55E ) with a C - terminal His - tag was purified and used in bandshifts and DNase I footprinting .
BL21 cells carrying the pET21 - ompR ( D55E ) plasmid were grown in L broth ( 0.5 % NaCl ; 100 mg/ml carbenicillin ) and ompR ( D55E ) expression was induced at OD 600 0.5 with 1 mM IPTG .
Cells were harvested after 4.5 hr by centrifugation and the pellet were frozen overnight at 220u .
Native OmpR ( D55E ) - His was purified as follows : the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate , 300 mM sodium chloride , 10 mM imidazole ) , then treated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 24uC followed by sonication on ice .
Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 25 min and the supernatant was then incubated with nickelnitriloacetic acid agarose beads for 1 hr at 4uC with gentle rocking .
The agarose beads were loaded in a column and washed twice with four column volumes of wash buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , pH 8.0 ) , and protein was collected in elution buffer ( 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 250 mM imidazole , pH 8.0 ) .
Purified protein was desalted with Nanosep 3K Omega membranes ( Pall ) at 4uC , then resuspended in storage buffer ( 20 % glycerol , 40 mM Tris , 200 mM KCl ) and stored at 280u .
OmpR ( D55E ) purity was assessed on Coomassie stained SDS - PAGE gels , and concentration was quantified by both the Bradford assay and by comparison to protein standards on Coomassie stained SDS - PAGE gels .
Bandshifts Bait DNA was PCR amplified using the primers pZec .6 FAM.R ( labeled with a 59 6 - FAM fluorophore ) and pZec.confirm.F ( Table S2 ) , from pZec promoter clones .
Amplicons were spin column purified then used as bait DNA in bandshifts .
OmpR - DNA binding reactions ( 10 ml ) contained 0.26 TBE ( 89 mM Tris , 89 mM borate , 2 mM EDTA ( pH 8.3 ) , 40 mg/ml poly ( dI - dC ) DNA , and 40 nM bait DNA .
Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 min before being loaded onto a running polyacrylamide gel ( 30:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide , 0.26 TBE , 2 % glycerol ) with 0.26 TBE running buffer .
After electrophoresis for 40 min at 100 V , 6 - FAM - labeled DNA was visualized using a Typhoon scanner ( GE Healthcare ) .
DNase I footprinting of OmpR binding to PCR - amplified gene promoters Bait DNA was prepared as for bandshifts using either the primer sets pZec .6 FAM.F and pZec.confirm.R ( top strand ) or pZec .6 - FAM.R and pZec.confirm.F ( bottom strand ) .
DNase I footprinting reactions were conducted in 15 ml reaction volumes containing 16 DNase I buffer ( Roche ) ( 40 mM Tris - HCl , 10 mM NaCl , 6 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM CaCl 2 ; pH 7.9 ) , 0.01 mM dithiothreitol , 100 ng/ml BSA , 50 nM bait DNA , and 5 mM OmpR ( D55E ) - His .
OmpR - DNA binding was allowed to equilibrate at 37uC for 15 minutes , then 1 ml ( 0.015 units ) of pre - warmed DNase I was added and mixed gently , then incubated at 37uC for 10 minutes .
Reactions were stopped by addition of 2 ml EDTA ( 100 mM ) followed by vigorous vortex mixing and heat denaturation at 95uC for 10 min .
Digestion products were desalted using MicroSpin G - 50 columns ( GE Healthcare ) and were analyzed on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer along with GeneScan 500 - LIZ size standards ( Applied Biosystems ) .
DNase I footprinting of OmpR binding to supercoiled gene promoters Plasmids with varying degrees of superhelical density were generated as follows : pZec - PompR was purified from E. coli CSH50 at different topological states by growing cells overnight in 25 ml L ( 0 % NaCl ) in a well - aerated 250 ml glass flask ( low supercoiling ) or overnight in 6 ml L ( 0.5 % NaCl ) in 14 mm diameter glass culture tubes ( high - supercoiling ) .
Topoisomers at the desired topological state were purified after separation on a 1 % agarose gel containing 2.5 mg/ml chloroquine .
The average superhelical density of each purified plasmid pool was determined by calculating the linking difference between the dominant topoisomer and fully relaxed DNA [ 52 ] .
A 1 % agarose gel containing 25 mg/ml chloroquine was used to improve the resolution of topoisomers in the low supercoiling sample ; in these conditions , more relaxed DNA migrates faster through the gel .
To generate a plasmid pool that lacked supercoiling , pZec - ompR was digested with XhoI , which cuts 500 bp away from the cloned promoter .
Because nicking of plasmid DNA by DNase I will allow DNA supercoils to relax , footprinting reactions were treated with DNase I for no more than 1 minute to reduce the time in which nicked plasmids could lose their topology .
In these reactions , 1 ml ( 0.15 units ) of DNase I was added to 15 ml OmpR - DNA binding PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 8 March 2012  Volume 8  Issue 3  e1002615 Salmonella SPI Gene Regulation reactions containing 10 mM OmpR and 1.5 nM bait DNA .
OmpR - DNA binding was equilibrated as above .
Primer extension was conducted using the primer pZec .6 - FAM.F and Thermo Sequenase polymerase ( USB ) with the following thermocycle : 95uC for 30 sec , 53uC for 30 sec , and 72uC for 90 sec , repeated 50 times .
Extension reactions contained 0.4 nM of nicked plasmid template .
Amplification products were desalted using MicroSpin G - 50 columns ( GE Healthcare ) and were analyzed on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer along with GeneScan 500 - LIZ size standards ( Applied Biosystems ) .
To compare samples , each was normalized to have the same total fluorescence signal across the DNA region being analysed .
