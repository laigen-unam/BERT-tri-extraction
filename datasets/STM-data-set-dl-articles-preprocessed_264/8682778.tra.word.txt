178 , No. 13 0021 - 9193/96 / $ 04.00 0 Efficient Translation of the RpoS Sigma Factor in Salmonella typhimurium Requires Host Factor I , an RNA - Binding Protein Encoded by the hfq Gene LARISSA BROWN AND THOMAS ELLIOTT * Department of Microbiology and Immunology , West Virginia University Health Sciences Center , Morgantown , West Virginia 26506 The RpoS transcription factor ( also called S or 38 ) is required for the expression of a number of stationary - phase and osmotically inducible genes in Escherichia coli .
RpoS is also a virulence factor for several pathogenic bacteria , including Salmonella typhimurium .
The activity of RpoS is regulated in response to several different signals , at the transcriptional and translational levels as well as by proteolysis .
Here we report that host factor I ( HF - I ) , the product of the hfq gene , is required for efficient expression of rpoS in S. typhimurium .
HF - I is a small , heat - stable , site - specific RNA - binding protein originally characterized for its role in replication of the RNA bacteriophage Q of E. coli .
Its role in the uninfected bacterial cell has previously been unknown .
Assays of - galactosidase in strains with rpoS - lac fusions , Western blot ( immunoblot ) analysis , and pulse - labeling and immunoprecipitation of both fusion proteins and native RpoS show that an S. typhimurium hfq mutant has a four - to sevenfold reduction in expression of rpoS that is attributable primarily to a defect in translation .
These results add a new level of complexity to the regulation of RpoS activity .

Enteric bacteria such as Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli live in vertebrate hosts as pathogens or commensals but also survive in nutrient - deficient soils and water ( 43 ) .
In both habitats they lead a `` feast - and - famine existence '' ( 34 ) , mainly famine punctuated by rare periods of nutritional surplus .
Recent work with E. coli has focused on the physiological changes that occur in batch cultures as growth slows and cells enter the stationary - phase ( 35 ) .
The rpoS gene encodes a specificity factor for RNA polymerase ( RpoS [ also called 38 or S ] ) ( 46 , 50 , 62 ) that is required for the transcription of many genes expressed during the onset of stationary - phase ( 40 ) .
RpoS - dependent adaptations include not only shifts in metabolic pathways but also resistance mechanisms developed as insurance against life - threatening stresses such as high - osmolarity , heat - shock , an elevated H 2 O 2 level , and UV light ( 26 , 40 ) .
Experimentally , many inducing treatments have been shown to increase both the abundance of RpoS and expression of RpoS - dependent genes .
These include the exhaustion of a single nutrient in minimal - medium containing limiting sources of carbon and energy , nitrogen , or phosphorus ( 21 , 66 ) , as well as growth into stationary - phase , where additional signals may include oxygen limitation , low pH , and high - cell - density ( 38 , 47 , 53 ) .
Furthermore , differences in stationary - phase induction are seen when a defined minimal - medium and a rich - medium such as Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium are compared ( 38 , 44 ) , and there are reports of induction by specific metabolites , including acetate , benzoate , and homoserine lactone ( 28 , 47 , 53 ) .
Osmotic challenge or growth in a high - osmolarity medium also increases RpoS activity ( 4 , 27 ) .
Not all RpoS - dependent genes are induced in every condition that increases the amount of RpoS protein ; this probably reflects the involvement of additional factors specific for each stimulus and regulated gene ( 40 ) .
Both transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of RpoS in response to various inducing treatments have been demonstrated ( 27 , 38 , 40 , 42 , 44 , 53 ) .
Control of RpoS abundance at the translational level and by proteolysis ( 38 , 66 ) is reminiscent of heat - shock sigma factor ( RpoH ) regulation ( 67 ) .
It has also been demonstrated that RpoS abundance is positively regulated by ppGpp ( 21 ) during limitation of different nutrients , including glucose .
Since glucose limitation is reported not to affect transcription of rpoS ( 38 ) , this again suggests posttranscriptional control mechanisms .
An hns mutant , lacking the abundant DNA - binding protein H - NS , has increased RpoS levels in exponential phase through effects on both translation and protein stability ( 4 , 66 ) ; RpoS stability was recently shown to be controlled by the ClpXP protease ( 55 ) .
Additionally , several mutants that apparently alter RpoS levels by affecting UDP - glucose , a putative intracellular signal - molecule ( 6 ) , have been found .
The E. coli hfq gene product , host factor I ( HF - I ) , was discovered through its role in the in - vitro replication of Q , an RNA bacteriophage ( 18 , 19 , 31 ) .
The function of HF - I in uninfected cells has been unknown , but it is an RNA - binding protein associated with ribosomes ( 9 , 32 , 56 ) , and hfq mutants are pleiotropic ( 64 ) .
In this report , we show that an S. typhimurium mutant defective in the hfq gene has substantially reduced expression of rpoS .
The pleiotrophy of hfq mutants may be partly explained by a requirement for HF - I in efficient translation of rpoS .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and construction .
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 ; the wild - type S. typhimurium strains LT2 and ATCC 14028s do not carry the lac operon .
The high - frequency generalized transducing bacteriophage P22 mutant HT105/1 int - 201 ( 54 ) was used for transduction in S. typhimurium by standard methods ( 12 ) .
Strain ATCC 14028s shows a phage P22 - resistant phenotype in cross - streak tests but is competent as a recipient in transduction .
To use ATCC 14028s and derivatives as transductional donors , P22 lysates were grown by zygotic induction by the method described previously ( 13 ) , except that the conjugational donor was an S. typhimurium strain .
3763 3764 BROWN AND ELLIOTT J. BACTERIOL .
b Except as noted , all S. typhimurium strains are derived from LT2 .
Fusions of DNA fragments derived from the E. coli katE and rpoS genes to lac were constructed as described below ; these lac fusions were transferred to the chromosome of an E. coli recD mutant by linear transformation as described previously ( 14 ) .
Phage P22 transducing lysates were grown in E. coli ( 13 , 14 ) and used to transduce the fusions into the S. typhimurium chromosome .
Each resulting strain carries a lac fusion in a single copy as an insertion of a Kan r - promoterlac fragment in the put operon .
Tn10d - Tet and Tn10d - Cam are derivatives of the transposon Tn10 that confer resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol , respectively .
These elements lack transposase but can move if transposase is also provided .
Their construction and use have been described previously ( 16 , 65 ) .
The transposition - defective Mu derivative Mud - Cam has also been described previously ( 15 ) .
The level of lac expression from the katE - lac [ op ] fusion in a single copy in an LT2 background is sufficient to give a weak Lac phenotype on MacConkey lactose indicator plates ( bull 's - eye colonies with red centers and a white periphery at 24 h ) , whereas the same fusion gives a strong Lac phenotype in ATCC 14028s and DB7000 .
To exchange the rpoS region between LT2 and ATCC 14028s , we first isolated a Tn10d - Tet insertion 50 % linked to rpoS in LT2 and then performed transductions as detailed in Table 1 and in Results .
In these crosses , transductants showing the Lac phenotype of the donor were presumed to have inherited the donor 's rpoS allele , while those with the Lac phenotype of the recipient have retained the recipient 's rpoS allele .
Bacteria were grown at 37 C in LB - medium ( 58 ) or in minimal MOPS ( morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ) medium ( 49 ) as modified ( 5 ) , with 0.2 % glucose as the carbon and energy source .
Plates were prepared by using nutrient agar ( Difco ) with 5gofNaCl per liter .
Antibiotics were added to final concentrations as follows : 100 g of sodium ampicillin per ml , 20 g of chloramphenicol per ml , 50 g of kanamycin sulfate per ml , and 20 g of tetracycline hydrochloride per ml .
MacConkey lactose agar was prepared as described previously ( 45 ) .
X - Gal ( 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - - D - galactopyranoside ) was used at 50 g/ml .
Construction of lac fusions .
The system we used has been described previously ( 14 ) .
Fusions were made in the pRS series of plasmids constructed by Simons et al. ( 59 ) .
The katE - lac fusion was originally obtained from P. C. Loewen as pRSkatE16 ( 47 ) .
This plasmid contains a 1.4 - kb SmaI - EcoRV fragment of the E. coli katE gene inserted into the SmaI site of pRS415 , creating an operon fusion of katE to lac at codon 181 of the katE gene .
The pRSkatE16 insert was excised by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into pRS551 .
This step added a Kan r gene upstream of the katE - lac fusion , which is necessary for the chromosomal substitution system .
The rpoS - lac protein fusion was constructed by digesting pMMkatF2 ( obtained from P. C. Loewen ) ( 46 ) with ClaI and EagI , filling in the ends with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I , and cloning the 1.6 - kb fragment into pRS552 that had been digested with EcoRI and BamHI and filled in .
We constructed a new lac operon fusion vector , pTE583 , derived from pRS552 by substituting a 2.2 - kb BamHI - SacI fragment from pTL61T ( 39 ) .
This construction places an RNase III site upstream of the lacZ gene in the pRS backbone .
The RNase III site should help to insulate lac expression from indirect effects on VOL .
178 , 1996 HF - I AND S. TYPHIMURIUM RpoS TRANSLATION 3765 messenger half - life ( 39 ) , but we do not known how efficient this insulating effect is .
To make the rpoS - lac operon fusion , the 1.6 - kb ClaI - EagI fragment of pMM katF2 was filled in and inserted into the SmaI site of pRS415 , subsequently excised by digestion at the flanking EcoRI and BamHI sites , and inserted into pTE583 .
The lac operon and protein fusions to rpoS are made at the identical EagI site at codon 73 of the rpoS gene and extend to the ClaI site upstream of nlpD .
For complementation studies of hfq , we modified the pBAD18 plasmid of Guzman et al. ( 24 ) ( a gift of T. Silhavy ) .
First , the NdeI site of pBAD18 was removed by filling in and religating to give pTE570 .
Next , an unrelated gene ( arcA ) with a strong ribosome binding site from pTE553 ( 10 ) was inserted as a DraI - KpnI fragment between the NheI ( filled in ) and KpnI sites of the vector .
This resulted in pTE571 , a plasmid that when digested with NdeI and an enzyme cutting in the multiple cloning site of pBAD18 will accept any gene having an NdeI site overlapping its ATG codon .
The inserted gene will be expressed as the native protein under the control of the arabinose promoter .
The hfq gene was PCR amplified from E. coli W3110 by using the primers 5 GGGAA TTCCA TATGG CTAAG GGGCA ATCTT TACAA G 3 and 5 CCCGG ATCCT TATTC GGTTT CTTCG CTGTC CTG 3 .
The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and BamHI , cloned into pK184 ( 30 ) , and sequenced .
The hfq fragment was subsequently excised by digestion with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into pTE571 to give the hfq expression plasmid , pTE577 .
Cells were centrifuged , resuspended in Z buffer ( 100 mM KPO 4 [ pH 7.0 ] , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM MgSO 4 ) , and then permeabilized by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) and chloroform ( 45 ) .
Assays were performed in Z buffer containing 50 mM - mercaptoethanol by a kinetic method with a plate reader ( Molecular Devices ) .
Activities ( change in optical density at 420 nm [ OD 420 ] per minute ) are normalized to the actual cell density ( OD 650 ) and were always compared with activities of appropriate controls assayed at the same time .
For experiments employing cultures grown to different densities , the number of cells harvested was adjusted to provide approximately equal cell densities in the assay .
The results shown are from a single experiment ; each experiment was repeated several times with similar results .
Sequencing of double - stranded plasmid DNA was done as previously described ( 13 ) by using Sequenase version 2.0 ( U.S. Biochemical Corp. ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Plasmid DNA for sequencing was isolated by column chromatography ( Qiagen ) .
Two - milliliter overnight cultures grown in LB - medium were used to prepare chromosomal DNA essentially as described previously ( 20 ) except that the DNA was recovered after ethanol precipitation by spooling on a microcapillary pipette and the RNase digestion was omitted .
The hfq : : Mud - Cam insertion was cloned from chromosomal DNA of strain TE5314 by digesting with HindIII and ligating to HindIII - digested pBR322 .
Transformants carrying the hfq : : Mud - Cam insertion were selected as Cam r colonies after electroporation of E. coli DH5 ; the resulting plasmid is pTE512 .
Sequencing utilized the MuL and MuR primers described previously ( 15 ) .
The hfq - 1 : : Mud - Cam insertion duplicates bp 935 to 939 of the S. typhimurium homolog of the sequence listed under accession no .
U00005 ( 31 ) ; the product of this disrupted gene is predicted to be identical to HF - I for 68 amino - acids and then to terminate after an additional 16 amino - acids .
The rpoS1071 : : Tn10d - Cam insertion was cloned from chromosomal DNA of strain TE4521 - 4 that had been partially digested with Sau3A and ligated to BamHI - digested pBR322 .
Sequencing utilized primers directed to the ends of the Cam r determinant : 5 GTTTC TATCA GCTGT CCCTC CTGTT C 3 and 5 GACGA TATGA TCATT TATTC TGCCT C 3 .
The rpoS1071 : : Tn10d - Cam insertion duplicates by 509 to 517 of the sequence listed under accession no .
U05011 ( 52 ) ; the product of this disrupted gene is predicted to be identical to RpoS for 53 amino - acids and then to terminate immediately .
Immunological detection of proteins .
For Western blots ( immunoblots ) , cultures were grown overnight in LB - medium , and the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in sample buffer ( 13 ) .
For a culture with an OD 600 of 4.0 , an equal volume of sample buffer was used ; otherwise , volumes were adjusted to give the same cell density .
Samples of 10 l of total protein were separated by standard SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 36 ) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Micron Separations ) by semidry electroblotting ( Bio - Rad ) in buffer containing 25 mM Tris base , 192 mM glycine , 20 % methanol , and 0.05 % SDS ( 21 , 63 ) .
Blots were blocked overnight at 4 C with 5 % nonfat milk in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ( 10 mM NaPO 4 [ pH 7.5 ] , 140 mM NaCl , 0.1 % NaN 3 ) , rinsed with 0.1 % Tween 20 in PBS , and incubated sequentially at room temperature with ascites fluid containing anti - RpoS , diluted 1:2,500 in 0.1 % Tween 20 in PBS ( monoclonal antibody 1RS1 ; a gift of L. H. Nguyen and R. R. Burgess [ 50 ] ) , with biotin - conjugated goat anti - mouse immunoglobulin G1 ( diluted 1:2,500 ) , and finally with streptavidin - conjugated horseradish peroxidase ( diluted 1:5,000 ; both from Southern Biotechnology Associates ) .
Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham ) .
Pulse - labeling and immunoprecipitation were carried out essentially as described previously ( 2 ) .
Labeling of LacZ and RpoS - LacZ used 25 Ci , and labeling of RpoS used 120 Ci , of [ 35 S ] methionine - [ 35 S ] cysteine ( Tran 35 S - label ; ICN ) ( 1,000 Ci/mmol ) per 0.5 ml of culture grown in minimal MOPS medium with 0.2 % glucose .
LacZ and RpoS - LacZ were immunoprecipitated ( 29 ) by using 1 g of a monoclonal antibody to - galactosidase ( Promega ) and protein A -- Sepharose CL - 4B ( Sigma ) for precipitation of antigen - antibody complexes .
RpoS was immunoprecipitated by the same method , using culture supernatants FIG. 1 .

containing a specific monoclonal antibody .
This antibody will be described elsewhere ; however , no significant cross - reaction is observed by either Western blotting or immunoprecipitation with extracts of rpoS mutants .
The amount of radioactivity in individual bands was determined with a PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) with background correction by the histogram peak method .
RESULTS In previous work , we isolated a series of S. typhimurium insertion mutants defective in rpoS ( the gene encoding the stationary - phase sigma factor ) and one mutant defective in hfq , a gene encoding an RNA - binding protein of unknown function ( 1 , 2 ) .
The rpoS and hfq mutants were identified by sequencing the sites of transposon insertions ( as described in Materials and Methods ) ; the DNA sequence of the S. typhimurium hfq gene and the deduced amino - acid sequence of the S. typhimurium HF - I protein are shown in Fig. 1 and compared with the sequence of E. coli HF - I .
In searching for common properties of these strains , we tested cultures that were grown to stationary - phase in LB - medium for the production of bubbles after challenge with H 2 O 2 .
Both the hfq mutant ( TE5314 hfq - 1 : : Mud - Cam ) and the rpoS mutants were defective by this test .
This result suggested that the hfq mutant might have lower levels of catalase HPII ( katE ) , whose induction during stationary phase requires RpoS ( 8 , 41 ) .
The hfq insertion mutant is defective in katE expression .
To test whether the hfq mutant is defective in katE expression , we obtained a lac fusion to the E. coli katE gene ( 47 ) and transferred it to the chromosome of S. typhimurium as described in Materials and Methods .
Assays of - galactosidase in LB overnight cultures showed that an hfq mutant derivative of the wild - type strain LT2 expressed katE - lac at about 25 % of the level seen in the parent ( Fig. 2 , bars a and b ) .
Because the activity of the RpoS sigma factor is variable even among wildtype isolates of E. coli K - 12 ( 40 ) and S. typhimurium LT2 ( 60 ) , we tested katE - lac expression in two additional S. typhimurium strains : the mouse - virulent strain ATCC 14028s and strain DB7000 ( genotype given in Table 1 ) .
In comparing these strains with LT2 , expression of katE - lac varied over a threefold range , but in each strain background it was substantially dependent on hfq and nearly completely dependent on rpoS ( Fig. 2 ) .
In each background , the fraction of activity remaining in the hfq mutant was about 25 % of that in the parent strain .
These results indicate that hfq function is required for a high level of katE gene expression .
Residual expression of katE - lac was also similar in each background when an rpoS insertion mutation was present ( about 3 % of the parental level ) .
This might indicate that the variation in katE expression among different strains is superimposed on rpoS regulation and independent of 3766 BROWN AND ELLIOTT J. BACTERIOL .
Dependence of katE - lac expression on hfq and rpoS .
A katE - lac operon fusion was placed in three different backgrounds ( indicated at the bottom ) , and then an hfq or rpoS insertion mutation was introduced .
- Galactosidase activity was assayed in cultures grown overnight to stationary - phase in LB medium , and results are presented in arbitrary units , normalized to the activity in a wild - type LT2 background .
Strains : a , TE6153 ; b , TE6167 ; c , TE6168 ; d , TE6154 ; e , TE6170 ; f , TE6171 ; g , TE6193 ; h , TE6231 ; i , TE6232 .
See Table 1 for complete genotypes .
Exchange of the rpoS region between LT2 and ATCC 14028s and its effect on katE - lac expression .
A Tn10d - Tet insertion linked to rpoS was used to construct strains with either the LT2 or ATCC 14028s background ( indicated at the bottom ) in which the rpoS region was derived from either LT2 or ATCC 14028s .
The parent strains do not carry the linked Tn10d - Tet insertion .
All strains also carried a katE - lac fusion , and - galactosidase activity was assayed as described for Fig. 2 .
Strains : a , TE6153 ; b , TE6227 ; c , TE6228 ; d , TE6154 ; e , TE6225 ; f , TE6226 .
However , other results , presented below , show that expression of katE - lac in LT2 and ATCC 14028s is at least partly determined by differences in the rpoS region .
An S. typhimurium strain with a high level of RpoS activity .
We investigated the strain dependence of RpoS activity , as measured with the katE - lac reporter , by using a transposon insertion linked to rpoS to exchange this region between LT2 and the virulent strain ATCC 14028s in phage P22 - mediated transductional crosses ( see Materials and Methods for details ) .
Analysis of the resulting recombinant strains shows that there is a genetic difference in the rpoS region , likely reflecting differences in rpoS gene structure or regulatory elements , that determines the different levels of RpoS activity and katE - lac expression in LT2 and ATCC 14028s .
Thus , LT2 with the rpoS allele derived from ATCC 14028s exhibits a higher level of katE - lac expression , while ATCC 14028s carrying the rpoS allele of LT2 shows reduced activity , compared with the activities of the respective parental strains ( Fig. 3 ) .
However , expression with the ATCC 14028s rpoS allele is much higher in LT2 than in the ATCC 14028s background ( Fig. 3 , bar b ) .
The recombinant strain TE6227 has about sevenfold higher RpoS activity , and this was confirmed by Western blots ( see below ) .
Multiple mechanisms that regulate RpoS expression and stability are already known from studies with E. coli ( see the introduction ) and S. typhimurium ( 60 ) ; we have not yet determined the genetic factors other than rpoS that are responsible for the differences between LT2 and ATCC 14028s .
Significantly , we found that the hfq mutation reduced katE - lac expression in TE6227 by the same factor as for the strains shown in Fig. 2 ( 7 ) ; it was also found to reduce synthesis of RpoS ( see below ) .
The defect of the hfq mutant is not due to polarity .
The region directly downstream of hfq contains the genes of the hfl locus , previously described for E. coli ( reviewed in reference 23 ) .
The hflK and hflC genes encode a protease active on the cII protein of phage , and hence , hflK and hflC mutants of E. coli show an increased frequency of lysogeny upon infection by phage .
The hflX gene lies between hfq and hflKC , and hflX is cotranscribed with hfq in E. coli ( 64 ) ; hflX encodes a putative GTP - binding protein of unknown function ( 51 ) .
It was possible that the hfq - 1 : : Mud - Cam insertion might affect katE - lac expression indirectly through polarity on hflX .
We tested this by constructing a plasmid , pTE577 , that expresses the E. coli hfq gene under the control of the araBAD promoter .
In this plasmid ( a derivative of pBAD18 [ 24 ] ) , hfq expression is inducible by arabinose .
Cultures of an S. typhimurium hfq mutant with a katE - lac fusion and carrying either pTE577 or the parent vector were grown into stationary - phase in the presence of different amounts of arabinose ( Fig. 4A ) .
Inducer - dependent complementation was observed , demonstrating that the defect in katE - lac expression of the hfq insertion mutant is corrected by a functional copy of hfq and is therefore not due to polarity on hflX .
Even at high concentrations of inducer , the level of expression was comparable to that observed with hfq in a single copy on the chromosome .
Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the effect of hfq on katE expression is a consequence of reduced levels of RpoS ( see below ) .
We used an rpoS - lac fusion to perform a similar complementation test by expressing E. coli hfq in an rpoS - lac [ pr ] hfq : : Mud - Cam strain ( Fig. 4B ) .
Again , the effect of the hfq mutant was corrected by expression of E. coli hfq alone and is therefore not due to polarity .
The hfq mutant has reduced amounts of RpoS protein .
To investigate whether reduced expression of the katE - lac reporter in the hfq mutant can be ascribed to lower levels of the RpoS sigma factor , we used a monoclonal antibody ( 1RS1 [ 50 ] ) , reactive with E. coli RpoS , to probe Western blots of total cell proteins ( Fig. 5 ) .
A protein reactive with the monoclonal antibody against RpoS was present in rpoS strains but not in otherwise isogenic rpoS mutant derivatives ( for E. coli , compare lanes a and b of Fig. 5 ; for S. typhimurium , compare lanes c and e as well as lanes f and h ) .
The abundance of RpoS in S. typhimurium correlated with RpoS activity as determined in the same strains by using the katE - lac reporter ( compare lanes c and f of Fig. 5 with bars b and a of Fig. 3 ) .
RpoS is less abundant in the LT2 hfq mutant ( compare lanes f and g of Fig. 5 ) .
This overexposed blot does not clearly show the decreased abundance of RpoS in the hfq mutant derivative of TE6227 , although it can be discerned in the original film .
However , other data , including katE - lac expression ( Fig. 3 ) and pulse - VOL .

Complementation test of the effect of hfq on katE - lac and rpoS - lac expression .
Strains carried either a katE - lac operon fusion ( A ) or an rpoS - lac protein fusion ( B ) .
In each experiment , three strains were analyzed : an hfq : : Mud - Cam insertion mutant carrying the P ara vector ( filled circles ) , an hfq strain carrying the P ara vector ( filled squares ) , and an hfq : : Mud - Cam insertion mutant carrying the P ara - hfq expression plasmid ( open circles ) .
Cultures were grown overnight to stationary - phase in LB - medium containing ampicillin and the indicated amount of arabinose and then assayed for - galactosidase .
The slope was plotted by using only the first four datum points for the strain carrying the expression plasmid ( open circles ) .
labeling of RpoS ( see below ) , also show a defect for the hfq mutant in this strain background .
We have found a reduction of RpoS synthesis in hfq mutant derivatives of all S. typhimurium strains examined .
Effect of the hfq mutant on expression of rpoS - lac fusions .
We constructed lac protein and operon fusions to the E. coli rpoS gene and placed them in single copy in the S. typhimurium chromosome as described in Materials and Methods .
The fusions contain a DNA segment starting at the ClaI site upstream of the nlpD gene and extending to the EagI site at codon 73 of rpoS .
The inserted fragment includes both the basal and the stationary - phase inducible promoter for rpoS ( 37 , 61 ) .
Strains carrying an rpoS - lac protein fusion were assayed for - galactosidase during - growth into stationary - phase in LB - medium ( Fig. 6 ) .
Expression of rpoS - lac was highly inducible in the wild type , but the level was substantially reduced in the hfq mutant , reaching only 30 % of that in the hfq parent at 24 h .
In contrast , when a similar experiment was performed with strains carrying an rpoS - lac operon fusion , the hfq mutant had - galactosidase levels almost as high as those in the hfq strain : expression at 24 h was 85 % of that in the parent .
Western blot analysis of RpoS levels .
The arrow indicates RpoS .
Cultures were grown overnight to stationary - phase in LB - medium .
Strains : a , MG1655 ( E. coli wild type ) ; b , TE6256 ( E. coli MG1655 rpoS : : Tn10 ) ; c , TE6227 ( S. typhimurium LT2 with rpoS of ATCC 14028s ) ; d , TE6241 ( as TE6227 but hfq : : Mud - Cam ) ; e , TE6248 ( as TE6227 but rpoS : : Tn10d - Cam ) ; f , TE6153 ( S. typhimurium LT2 ) ; g , TE6167 ( as TE6153 but hfq : : Mud - Cam ) ; h , TE6168 ( as TE6153 but rpoS : : Tn10d - Cam ) .
The positions of molecular mass markers ( in kilodaltons ) are indicated on the right .
indicate that the lack of hfq function primarily affects translation and not transcription of rpoS .
The small effect on transcription could be a secondary consequence of reduced translation ( e.g. , see reference 11 ) .
We carried out pulse - labeling experiments to demonstrate directly that the effect of the hfq mutation is primarily on translation of rpoS.To do this , cells were labeled during exponential - growth in minimal glucose medium at a low density .
Under these conditions , assay of - galactosidase shows a six - to sevenfold reduction in expression of an rpoS - lac [ pr ] fusion in the hfq mutant compared with that in the wild type ( 7 ) .
In the first experiment , a monoclonal antibody to - galactosidase was used to immunoprecipitate labeled proteins ( 2 - min pulse ) from the rpoS - lac protein and operon fusion strains described above ( Fig. 7 ) .
The ratio of RpoS - LacZ expression from the protein fusion construct in hfq mutant and hfq strains was computed and was compared with a similar ratio of LacZ expression from the operon fusion in mutant and wildtype strains ( Table 2 ) .
A comparison of the relative effects on protein and operon fusions eliminated potential confounding effects of the pleiotropic hfq mutation , such as the slower growth - rate of hfq mutants ( 80 - min doubling time compared with 49 min for the wild type ) , and possible effects of hfq on transcriptional control .
The results clearly show a differential effect on the protein fusion and agree reasonably well with measurements of - galactosidase activity .
These pulse - labeling results reflect only rates of synthesis rather than stability of RpoS - LacZ : a pulse - chase protocol demonstrated that the hybrid protein was stable in both hfq mutant and wild - type cells ( 90 % remaining in a 12 - min chase ) ( 7 ) .
Although we did not succeed in using the 1RS1 monoclonal antibody to immunoprecipitate RpoS , we have recently isolated other monoclonal antibodies that are active both on Western blots and in immunoprecipitation by our standard protocol ( 12a , 29 ) .
Figure 8 shows the results of pulse - labeling ( 1 min ) and immunoprecipitation with one antibody ( R12 ) in the hfq strain TE6227 ( duplicate cultures analyzed in lanes a and b ) and its hfq mutant derivative ( lanes c and d ) .
Quantitation of the radioactivity in these bands , corrected for the total incorporation into protein , reveals that the rate of synthesis of RpoS in the hfq mutant is about 20 % of that in the wild type .

DISCUSSION The experiments reported here demonstrate that a functional hfq gene is required for efficient translation of the stationary - phase sigma factor RpoS in S. typhimurium .
Residual expression in an hfq mutant varies depending on the medium and stage of growth but is four - to sevenfold lower than in a wild - type strain .
Two previous reports have documented a role for hfq homologs in enhancing gene expression : for the nitrogen - regulatory protein nifA in Azorhizobium caulinodans ( 33 ) and for yst , encoding the heat - stable enterotoxin in Yersinia enterocolitica ( 48 ) .
Neither in this work nor in the previous studies has it been determined whether the effect of hfq is direct ; however , it would not be surprising to find that an rpoS homolog mediates the hfq effect on either nifA or yst expression .
The E. coli hfq gene product , HF - I , was discovered as a protein required for in - vitro replication of the RNA bacteriophage Q ( 18 , 19 , 31 ) .
Like ribosomal protein S1 , HF - I is specifically required for copying a Q plus - strand template , whereas neither S1 nor HF - I is required with a Q minusstrand template ( 19 , 32a ) .
Unlike S1 , HF - I does not copurify with the Q replicase .
The HF - I protein is a hexamer ( 19 ) or pentamer ( 32 ) of 11 - kDa subunits , and it is capable of binding specifically to a small number of sites on Q and R17 phage RNAs ( 3 , 56 ) .
Three HF - I binding sites on Q RNA have been characterized as being rich in A residues , and importantly , FIG. 7 .
Pulse - labeling and immunoprecipitation of - galactosidase from strains carrying rpoS - lac fusions .
Each strain was pulse - labeled in duplicate , and the samples were analyzed in parallel .
Cultures were grown in minimal MOPS medium with 0.2 % glucose to an OD 600 of 0.4 , pulse - labeled for 2 min , and immunoprecipitated with anti- - galactosidase antibody .
Strains were TE6266 ( LT2 rpoS - lac [ pr ] hfq - 1 : : Mud - Cam ) , TE6253 ( LT2 rpoS - lac [ pr ] ) , TE6318 ( LT2 rpoS - lac [ op ] hfq - 1 : : Mud - Cam ) , and TE6317 ( LT2 rpoS - lac [ op ] ) .
The protein fusions substitute 73 amino - acids from rpoS , plus the linker , for 9 amino - acids of lacZ .
One - tenth of the amount of immunoprecipitated protein was analyzed from the operon fusion strains .
HF - I binds tightly to isolated oligonucleotides containing these sites and lacking significant secondary structure ( 56 ) .
HF - I also binds to poly ( A ) ( 9 ) .
No significant homology was found between the sequenced HF - I binding sites in Q RNA and the first 70 codons of rpoS ( 7 ) , a region suggested to contain important regulatory sequences ( 38 ) .
It has been suggested that HF - I might serve during the initiation of replication to bring the 3 end of the template - RNA to a replicase complex bound at two internal sites ( 3 ) .
Replicase binding to internal sites could help to ensure that replication and translation do not occur on the same RNA molecule simultaneously .
The gene for HF - I was described only recently , and it is not known whether hfq function is required for phage Q infection in vivo .
It is possible that there is more than one protein of this type , and if so , the requirement for HF - I-like proteins may actually be more strict than is apparent from the defect observed in the hfq mutant .
The insertion mutant we used contains a Mud transposon at codon 68 ( of a total of 102 ) ; it is also possible that this mutant retains partial function .
The function of HF - I in uninfected cells has not been defined , but it is associated with ribosomes ( 9 , 32 ) , and hfq mutants are pleiotropic ( 64 ) .
Several facts have suggested that HF - I and the DNA - binding protein H - NS might have related functions .
HF - I and H - NS were observed to copurify through several steps ; however , purified H - NS can not substitute for HF - I in Q replication ( 31 ) .
Phenotypes reported for an E. coli hfq mutant included osmosensitivity , SOS - independent cell elongation , and altered plasmid supercoiling ; similar defects are also seen with mutants that lack abundant DNA - binding proteins , including H - NS ( 64 ) .
A mutation in hfq suppressed ( reduced ) activation of the cryptic bgl operon in an hns mutant ( 64 ) ; both effects could be explained if bgl activation requires RpoS .
Finally , multicopy plasmids bearing hfq or the hns - like gene stpA complement some defects of hns mutants ( 57 ) .
We favor a model in which the translational efficiency of rpoS mRNA depends on HF - I ; an alternative possibility would be a direct effect of HF - I on message stability .
Low translational efficiency could be due , in part , to the extensive secondary structure postulated to occur in this RNA ( 38 ) .
Since HF - I is reported to bind tightly to unstructured Q RNA ( 56 ) , it may not act simply to unzip duplex RNA and allow access to the ribosome .
Alternatively , HF - I may bind only to particular duplex RNA structures like one found in rpoS ; S1 protein exhibits this type of dual specificity for structured and unstruc - VOL .

tured RNA targets ( 52a ) .
We can also speculate on indirect models .
Perhaps HF - I facilitates the synthesis or activity of an RNA helicase which then works on rpoS RNA , for example , one of the family of DEAD proteins found in E. coli and , presumably , in S. typhimurium ( 53a ) .
The partners of HF - I contributed by E. coli for its only characterized function , in Q replication , are ET - Tu , EF - Ts , and S1 .
Perhaps HF - I simply facilitates the unwinding activity of S1 , or HF - I might counteract a negative influence of a protein that binds to rpoS mRNA ( e.g. , EF - Tu or H - NS ) .
Another important question is the role of HF - I in regulation of RpoS .
In this work , we measured the rate of synthesis of RpoS during exponential - growth in minimal glucose medium , a condition permitting only very low - level expression of rpoS , and found that synthesis was reduced in the hfq mutant by four - to fivefold .
Assays of - galactosidase expression from a katE - lac fusion suggested a deficit of about sixfold in RpoS activity caused by the hfq mutation in the same strain background and under the same growth - conditions .
These reductions are similar to , and even slightly more pronounced than , the decrease in RpoS activity reported by katE - lac at stationary phase in LB - medium .
These results suggested that HF - I might function not as a regulatory element but as a factor that is continuously required for stimulation of translation .
However , preliminary experiments also show that hfq mutants are severely defective in induction of rpoS - lac expression upon osmotic challenge .
Thus , HF - I may both stimulate basal expression and mediate osmotic regulation of translation .
There is , in addition , a dramatic stabilization of the RpoS polypeptide after osmotic challenge ( 45a ) which is unlikely to require HF - I .
Further work should clarify the role of HF - I in RpoS regulation .
Finally , we constructed an S. typhimurium strain ( TE6227 ) with high - level expression of RpoS due to a favorable combination of background ( LT2 ) and rpoS allele ( from ATCC 14028s ) .
This strain was particularly useful for pulse - labeling studies .
We noticed that the high - level expression of rpoS in this strain causes unusual phenotypes , including a striking deficit of porins ( 22 ) and more than a fourfold reduction in both FIG. 8 .
Pulse - labeling and immunoprecipitation of RpoS .
Each strain was pulse - labeled in duplicate , and the samples were analyzed in parallel .
Cultures were grown in minimal MOPS medium with 0.2 % glucose to an OD 600 of 0.3 , pulse - labeled for 1 min , and immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti - RpoS antibody .
Strains were TE6227 hfq ( lanes a and b ) and TE6241 hfq - 1 : : Mud - Cam ( lanes c and d ) .
aerobic oxidases as assayed by cyo - lac and cyd - lac expression ( 7 ) .
For both the porin - and cytochrome - related phenotypes , a mutation in hfq was observed to cause a partial reversal of the phenotype to one of a strain expressing moderate levels of RpoS .
We postulate that particularly high levels of RpoS lead to competition between RpoS and 70 for binding to RNA polymerase core , resulting in defective expression of some 70 - dependent genes .
This might also explain why we were unable to transfer the rpoS allele of ATCC 14028s into the DB7000 background ( 7 ) , since this combination would be predicted to yield still higher levels of RpoS .
