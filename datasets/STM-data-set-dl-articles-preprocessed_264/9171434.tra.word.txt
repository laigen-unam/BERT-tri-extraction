179 , No. 11 0021 - 9193/97 / $ 04.00 0 Integration Host Factor Is Required for 1,2 - Propanediol - Dependent Transcription of the cob/pdu Regulon in Salmonella typhimurium LT2 MICHELLE R. RONDON † AND JORGE C. ESCALANTE - SEMERENA * Department of Bacteriology , University of Wisconsin -- Madison , Madison , Wisconsin 53706 We show that integration host factor ( IHF ) is required for the activation of transcription of the cobalamin biosynthetic ( cob ) and 1,2 - propanediol ( 1,2 - PDL ) utilization ( pdu ) operons in Salmonella typhimurium LT2 .
A lack of IHF affected transcription of the cob/pdu regulon in at least two ways .
First , the level of the regulatory protein PocR was decreased in ihfB ( formerly himD ) mutants , as judged by Western blot analysis with polyclonal antiserum raised against PocR .
Second , even when PocR was available , in the absence of IHF , PocR was unable to activate transcription of cob/pdu in response to 1,2 - PDL .
This result suggested an additional role for IHF in PocR - dependent transcription activation .
Consistent with these findings , ihfB mutants of this bacterium were unable to use 1,2 - PDL as a carbon or energy source .
Transcription of the cobalamin biosynthetic ( cob ) and 1,2 - propanediol ( 1,2 - PDL ) utilization ( pdu ) operons in Salmonella typhimurium is induced in response to 1,2 - PDL in the medium ( 5 , 16 ) .
This regulation is mediated by PocR , a protein belonging to the AraC family of transcription factors ( 15 , 18 ) .
Transcription of cob/pdu is also influenced by the cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) receptor protein - cAMP complex and by ArcA ( 1 -- 3 , 5 , 8 ) .
Although the effects of these global regulatory proteins have not been shown directly , it is thought that the cAMP receptor protein - cAMP complex acts by inducing pocR transcription ( 1 ) , while ArcA may increase pocR transcription under anoxic conditions and may activate cob transcription directly ( 1 , 2 ) .
In vitro , 1,2 - PDL had a strong positive effect on the binding of PocR to the cob promoter region ( 15 ) .
In vivo , 1,2 - PDL may also play a role in the modulation of the level of PocR in the cell , since PocR -- 1,2 - PDL may activate transcription from the upstream pduF promoters .
These promoters ( see Fig. 2 ) were postulated to transcribe pocR ( 6 ) .
Thus , 1,2 - PDL may affect both the activity and the level of PocR in the cell .
We demonstrate herein that the global regulatory protein integration host factor ( IHF ) is required for transcription of the cob/pdu regulon .
IHF is a sequence - specific DNA - binding protein which participates in many cellular processes , including site - specific recombination , DNA replication , and regulation of transcription ( 10 ) .
Data showing that IHF is required at multiple steps during the induction of cob/pdu transcription in response to 1,2 - PDL are presented .
IHF mutants are unable to transcribe the cob/pdu regulon in response to 1,2 - PDL .
Expression of cbi and pdu operon fusions was measured as a function of IHF in the cell .
- Galactosidase activity was measured in strains JE1734 ( metE205 ara - 9 cbi - 24 : : MudI134 ) , JE4000 ( metE205 ara - 9 cbi - 24 : : MudI1734 ihfB : : Cm ) , JE2507 ( metE205 ara - 9 pdu - 12 : : MudI1734 ) , and JE4001 ( metE205 ara - 9 pdu - 12 : : MudI1734 ihfB : : Cm ) grown in the University of Wisconsin -- Madison , 1550 Linden Dr. , Madison , WI 53706 - 1567 .

presence or absence of 1,2 - PDL as described elsewhere ( 16 ) .
cbi - 24 : : MudI1734 is a fusion within the cob operon , and expression of this fusion measures cob expression .
pdu - 12 : : MudI1734 is located within the pdu operon ( 12 ) .
ihfB ( formerly known as himD [ 14 , 22 ] ) mutants were completely defective in 1,2 - PDL - dependent transcription , whereas the ihfB control strains were able to induce cob/pdu transcription in response to 1,2 - PDL .
We measured a 45 - fold reduction in the expression of cbi - 24 : : MudI1734 in the ihfB mutant JE4000 ( ca. 2Uof - galactosidase activity ) relative to that in the ihfB strain JE1734 ( ca. 90 U of - galactosidase activity ) .
Similarly , expression of pdu - 12 : : MudI1734 in the ihfB mutant strain JE4001 ( ca. 1Uof - galactosidase activity ) was reduced 75 - fold relative to the level measured in the ihfB strain JE2507 ( ca. 75 U of - galactosidase activity ) .
ihfB mutants were also defective in the transcription of fusion cbi - 24 : : MudI1734 ( JE4001 ) under anaerobic growth - conditions ( data not shown ) .
As a control , we examined the transcription of the cobA gene , which encodes the ATP : corrinoid adenosyltransferase required for cobalamin synthesis .
The cobA gene is unlinked to the cob operon at 43.5 centisomes , and its transcription is not affected by factors known to regulate expression of the main cob operon ( 9 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 20 ) .
Transcription of a cobA343 : : MudI1734 fusion ( strain JE1096 ) was unaffected by the introduction of the ihfB mutation ( strain JE4002 ) ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that IHF was required for the activation of cob/pdu expression in response to 1,2 - PDL .
Consistent with these data , ihfB mutants were unable to grow with 1,2 - PDL as their carbon or energy source ( Fig. 1 ) .
Growth of the ihfB mutant on 1,2 - PDL was restored by providing ihfB in trans by using plasmid pHX3 - 8 , which contained wild - type copies of the ihfA and ihfB genes of Escherichia coli ( Fig. 1 ) ( 14 ) .
Location of potential IHF - binding sites within the cob/pdu control region .
Using the MacTargsearch program , developed to identify putative IHF - binding sites ( 11 ) , we located several potential IHF sites between pdu and cob .
The locations of these sites in the cob/pdu control region are shown in Fig. 2 ( 6 , 7 , 15 , 18 ) ; scores for similarity among these sites are also presented in Fig. 2 .
Although these have not been shown to be functional IHF - binding sites in - vivo , they provided a starting point for investigating the role of IHF in this system .

Growth on 1,2 - PDL requires IHF .
Cells were grown aerobically in NCE medium containing methionine ( 0.5 mM ) , MgSO 4 ( 0.1 mM ) , 1,2 - PDL ( 50 mM ) , and cyanocobalamin ( 75 nM ) .
Ampicillin was added to 20 g/ml for the maintenance of pHX3 - 8 .
Growth was monitored by measuring the A 650 .
Symbols : open circles , TR6583 ( ihfB ) ; open squares , JE3999 ( ihfB : Cm ) ; closed circles , JE4003 ( ihfB ) / pHX3 - 8 ; closed squares , JE4004 ( ihfB : : Cm ) / pHX3 - 8 .
All strains were derivatives of strain TR6583 ( metE205 ara - 9 ) .
Plasmid pHX3 - 8 carries bla , whose product ( - lactamase ) provides resistance to ampicillin ( 14 ) .
transcription compared 20 putative IHF - binding sites in E. coli operons where binding was confirmed by DNase I footprinting and/or gel - retardation assay ( 10 ) .
For these sites , binding affinity was less correlated to the similarity score obtained by MacTargsearch , with the average score being only 46.8 .
Since many of the operons tested had altered expression in an ihf mutant background ( 10 ) , this finding suggested that the lowerscoring sites in the cob/pdu control region may be physiologically relevant .
ihfB mutants produce detectable levels of PocR protein .
To determine the effect of IHF on PocR levels in - vivo , we measured the levels of PocR in strains containing an ihfB , pduF , or pocR insertion mutation by Western blot analysis and compared those levels to the level in the wild - type strain .
Cells were grown aerobically on NCE medium ( 21 ) containing succinate ( 30 mM ) , pyruvate ( 2 mM ) , MgSO 4 ( 1 mM ) , methionine ( 0.5 mM ) , and 1,2 - PDL ( 25 mM ) .
These conditions were found to maximize the level of PocR in the cell .
One - milliliter samples were collected at an A 650 of 0.5 and resuspended in 0.1 ml of loading buffer ( 4 ) per 0.5 A 650 unit .
Thus , equal amounts of cells of each strain were used as a source of protein and were loaded onto the gel .
Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 13 ) and then transferred to an Immobilon - P membrane ( Millipore , Bedford , Mass. ) by using a Mini Trans - Blot apparatus at 100 V for 1 h according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Bio - Rad , Richmond , Calif. ) .
Western blots were performed as outlined in the ECL kit manual ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , Ill. ) , with a few modifications .
Membranes were blocked at 4 °C overnight , and Tris - buffered saline with 0.05 % Tween 20 and 5 % dry milk was used for all incubations .
Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against PocR were prepared by the Animal Care Facility of the Medical School at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison and were used at a 30,000 - fold final dilution .
The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit immunoglobulin G ( Pierce , Rockford , Ill. ) and was diluted 1:20,000 .
X - ray film ( XAR - 50 ; Kodak ) was used to detect the signal .
As shown in Fig. 3 , the level of PocR in strains containing an FIG. 2 .

Lines with arrows indicate the direction and origin of the inferred transcripts .
The small boxes indicate the locations of the putative IHF - binding sites .
The region upstream of the cob promoter is enlarged below the main diagram to show the relative locations of the PocR - binding sites ( hatched boxes ) and the putative IHF - binding site within that region .
( B ) The MacTargsearch program provides a similarity score relating the putative IHF - binding site to the consensus sequence , with the average score being 60 and the lowest score being 46.2 ( 11 ) .
ihfB mutants contain a level of PocR similar to that observed in pduF mutants .
A Western blot of total cell extract probed with anti - PocR antiserum is shown .
Equal amounts of total cells were loaded ; thus , the levels of PocR in different lanes can be directly compared .
PocR was detected as described in the text .
Lane 1 , TR6583 ( pduF pocR ihfB ) ; lane 2 , JE3999 ( pduF pocR ihfB : : Cm ) ; lane 3 , JE1925 ( pduF501 : : Tn10d ( Tc ) pocR ihfB ) ; lane 4 , JE1935 ( pduF pocR106 : : Tn10d ( Tc ) ihfB ) .
All strains were derivatives of strain TR6583 ( metE205 ara - 9 ) .
ihfB or a pduF mutation was decreased relative to the amount of PocR in the wild - type strain ( Fig. 3 , lanes 2 and 3 , respectively ) , suggesting that both these mutations interfere with maximal PocR production in the presence of 1,2 - PDL .
As expected , no PocR was detected in the strain containing the pocR insertion ( Fig. 3 , lane 4 ) .
The important point is that the amount of PocR in the ihfB strain was equal to or greater than that found in the pduF strain , suggesting that IHF - deficient mutants , which produce PocR protein at a level comparable to that seen in the pduF mutant , still require IHF to transcribe cob/pdu .
These results imply that IHF was involved at more than one level in the 1,2 - PDL - dependent activation of cob and pdu expression and was not required simply for PocR production .
ihfB mutants have a more severe effect on cob/pdu transcription than pduF mutants .
Since ihfB mutants were shown to have levels of PocR protein equal to or higher than those of pduF mutants , one might expect that the effects of the two mutations on cob/pdu transcription would be similar ; this was not the case .
We compared the effects of both mutations on cob and pdu expression and found that the two mutations had very different effects .
Results obtained with fusion pdu - 12 : : MudI1734 are shown in Table 1 .
Similar results were obtained with strains carrying the cbi - 24 : : MudI1734 fusion ( data not shown ) .
Cells were grown for these assays under the same growth - conditions that were used for the detection of PocR levels ; thus , the results from the two experiments can be compared .
In spite of the observed variability , the effect of the ihfB mutation was clearly similar to the effect of the pocR mutation , not to that of a pduF mutation .

eliminated transcription of the pdu and the cob operon fusions .
These results suggest that IHF had a role in the activation of cob/pdu transcription in addition to affecting the level of PocR in the cell .
This work shows that in S. typhimurium LT2 , ihfB mutants are unable to use 1,2 - PDL as a carbon or energy source .
IHF was required to produce wild - type levels of PocR protein in response to 1,2 - PDL and appears to play an additional role in the activation of cob/pdu expression .
The effect of a lack of IHF can not be explained solely by the decreased level of PocR in the cell , indicating that IHF is also required at another step in transcription activation .
We have previously shown that PocR binds to two regions upstream of the cob promoter ( 15 ) .
The documented role of IHF in binding and bending DNA suggests that it might be needed to help form a structure at the cob and pdu promoters which may be required for PocR function .
Preliminary data suggest that IHF may bind to the cob promoter region in - vitro ( data not shown ) .
Another possibility is that IHF is required indirectly for the production of a different , as - yet - unidentified factor which is required for PocR - dependent transcription activation .
Further experiments are needed to understand this additional requirement for IHF in the activation of cob/pdu transcription .
