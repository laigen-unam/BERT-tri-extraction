SONCINI 2 † Howard Hughes Medical Institute 1 and Department of Molecular Microbiology , 2 Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri 63110 The PmrA - PmrB two - component system of Salmonella typhimurium controls resistance to the peptide antibiotic polymyxin B and to several antimicrobial proteins from human neutrophils .
Amino acid substitutions in the regulatory protein PmrA conferring resistance to polymyxin lower the overall negative charge of the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , which results in decreased bacterial binding to cationic polypeptides and increased bacterial survival within human neutrophils .
We have now identified three PmrA - activated loci that are required for polymyxin resistance .
These loci were previously shown to be necessary for growth on low - Mg 2 solid media , indicating that LPS modifications that mediate polymyxin resistance are responsible for the adaptation to Mg 2 - limited environments .
Conditions that promote transcription of PmrA - activated genes -- growth in mildly acidic pH and micromolar Mg 2 concentrations -- increased survival in the presence of polymyxin over 16,000 - fold in a wild - type organism but not in a mutant lacking pmrA .
Our experiments suggest that low pH and low Mg 2 concentrations may induce expression of PmrA - activated genes within phagocytic cells and promote bacterial resistance to host antimicrobial proteins .
We propose that the LPS is a Mg 2 reservoir and that the PmrA - controlled LPS modifications neutralize surface negative charges when Mg 2 is transported into the cytoplasm during - growth in Mg 2 - limited environments .
The polymyxins are a group of cyclic , amphipathic , lipopeptide antibiotics that act preferentially on gram - negative bacteria ( 52 ) .
Polymyxins are cationic and show high affinity for negatively charged surfaces such as the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in the outer membrane , and not surprisingly , microorganisms that are resistant to polymyxin have a modified LPS that binds less polymyxin due to a lower overall negative charge ( 53 , 55 ) .
This is primarily due to neutralization of the acidic phosphate on lipid - A ( 3 , 24 , 25 , 36 , 56 ) .
For example , polymyxin - resistant mutants of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli have a higher substitution of the ester - linked phosphate group in the lipid - A portion of the LPS by 4 - amino - 4 - deoxy - L-arabinose and show larger amounts of 2 - aminoethanol esterifying phosphates in the core oligosaccharide ( 24 , 29 , 54 ) .
The 4 - aminoarabinose substitution is almost stoichiometric in strains of Proteus mirabilis ( 47 ) , Chromobacterium violaceum ( 22 ) , and Burkholderia cepacia ( 5 ) that exhibit innate resistance to polymyxins .
Two regulatory loci -- pmrA and phoP -- control polymyxin resistance in S. typhimurium .
The pmrA locus encodes a twocomponent system -- PmrA - PmrB -- and a putative membrane protein -- PmrC -- with no homologs in the sequence databases ( 41 , 42 ) .
S. typhimurium strains harboring the pmrA505 allele ( a single amino - acid substitution in the regulatory protein PmrA ) are resistant to polymyxin and exhibit cross - resistance to several other cationic antimicrobial polypeptides that bind LPS , including the neutrophil - derived cationic antimicrobial proteins 57 and 37 ( i.e. , CAP57 and CAP37 , also known as bactericidal/permeability - increasing protein and azurocidin , Institute , Washington University School of Medicine , Department of Molecular Microbiology , 660 S.

Resistance to host antimicrobial proteins appears to be necessary for survival within human neutrophils because a polymyxin - resistant pmrA mutant of a rough ( Rb LPS ) S. typhimurium strain is more resistant to killing by intact human polymorphonuclear neutrophils than the isogenic pmrA strain ( 51 ) .
The phoP locus encodes a distinct two - component system -- PhoP - PhoQ ( 14 , 32 ) -- that governs resistance to several amphipathic antimicrobial peptides , including defensins , magainins , and cecropins ( 9 , 15 , 16 , 33 ) , and was recently shown to be also required for resistance to polymyxin ( 19 , 30 ) .
The PhoQ protein is a sensor for extracellular Mg 2 and Ca 2 ( 12 , 13 ) that controls the activity of PhoP , a transcriptional regulator that governs expression of some 25 different loci ( 2 , 17 , 18 , 26 , 37 , 38 , 49 ) .
Transcription of PhoP - activated genes is induced in micromolar concentrations of Mg 2 and Ca 2 and repressed by growth in millimolar levels of these divalent cations ( 13 , 49 ) .
A subset of PhoP - regulated loci , including the pmrCAB operon , is regulated via the PmrA protein ( 19 , 23 , 50 ) .
Expression of PmrA - regulated genes is modulated by the extracellular concentration of Mg 2 in a PhoP - and PhoQ - dependent manner and by pH in a mechanism that is independent of the PhoP and PhoQ proteins ( 50 ) .
Thus , activation of PmrA - regulated genes involves a regulatory cascade in which the PmrA - PmrB and PhoP - PhoQ two - component systems interact to integrate pH and Mg 2 signals .
In this paper , we demonstrate that polymyxin resistance is environmentally regulated by pH and Mg 2 in a PmrA - dependent manner , we identify three PmrA - regulated determinants responsible for polymyxin resistance , and we establish that they correspond to loci previously shown to be required to form colonies on low - Mg 2 solid media .
We propose that the LPS is aMg 2 reservoir and that the PmrA - controlled LPS modifications neutralize surface negative charges when Mg 2 is transported into the cytoplasm during - growth in Mg 2 - limited environments .

( 43 ) .
Bacterial strains and growth - conditions .
Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Strains were constructed by phage P22 - mediated transductions as described elsewhere ( 6 ) .
Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth ( LB ) ( 31 ) , in N - minimal - medium containing 0.1 % Casamino Acids and 38 mM glycerol ( 48 ) adjusted to pH 7.7 or 5.8 with HCl , or in a modified N - minimal - medium containing 0.1 % Casamino Acids and 38 mM glycerol in which the 100 mM Tris - HCl was replaced by a mixture of 50 mM bis - Tris and 50 mM Tris adjusted to pH 7.7 or 5.8 with HCl .
MgCl 2 was added to a final concentration of 10 M or 10 mM .
Kanamycin was used at a final concentration of 50 g/ml , chloramphenicol was used at 25 g/ml , tetracycline was used at 10 g/ml , and polymyxin was used at 2.5 , 5.0 , and 20 g/ml .
Polymyxin resistance and - galactosidase assays .
The MIC of polymyxin was determined as described previously ( 41 ) .
One - hour polymyxin susceptibility assays were performed by a modification of a previously described procedure ( 15 ) .
In brief , overnight cultures of bacteria grown in N - minimal - medium with 10 mM Mg 2 and at pH 7.7 were washed three times in N - minimal - medium at pH 7.4 with no MgCl 2 and diluted 1:100 into N - minimal - medium with either 10 M MgCl 2 ( pH - 5.8 ) , 10 M MgCl 2 ( pH 7.7 ) , 10 mM MgCl 2 ( pH - 5.8 ) , or 10 mM MgCl 2 ( pH 7.7 ) .
After 3 to 4hofincubation at 37 °C , logarithmically growing bacteria were washed twice in N - minimal - medium with 10 mM MgCl 2 ( pH 7.7 ) and diluted to 5 10 4 to 1 10 5 CFU/ml in LB .
Polymyxin was added to a final concentration of 2.5 , 5.0 , or 20 g/ml , and after 1hofincubation at 37 °C with shaking , bacteria were diluted in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and plated onto LB agar plates .
The number of CFU was determined after overnight incubation .
Data are presented as percent survival relative to the original inoculum .
- Galactosidase activity was determined as described elsewhere ( 31 ) .
MIC of polymyxin B for strains harboring mutations in the pmrA locus and/or PmrA - regulated genes Strain Relevant genotype MIC ( g/ml ) EG9492 pmrA505 32 EG9493 pmrA 4 EG7139 pmrA1 : : cat 4 EG9860 pmrA505 ugd - 9228 : : MudJ 4 EG9862 pmrA505 pbgE1 : : MudJ 4 EG9868 pmrA505 pbgP1 : : MudJ 4 The pmrA505 allele promotes high transcriptional activity of PmrA - regulated genes .
It has been hypothesized that the PmrA505 protein confers resistance to polymyxin - by promoting transcription of PmrA - regulated determinants to high levels in the absence of the environmental signal controlling the PmrA - PmrB system ( 41 ) .
To test this hypothesis , we determined the transcriptional activity of the PmrA - activated genes pbgE , pbgP , and ugd in isogenic pmrA505 and pmrA strains by measuring the - galactosidase activity of strains harboring lac fusions to these loci .
When the strains were grown in LB , transcription of PmrA - activated genes was four to eight times higher in the pmrA505 mutant than in the pmrA strain ( Fig. 1 ) .
In contrast , the transcriptional activity of the PmrA - independent mgtA gene was not affected by the pmrA allele .
Taken together with the results from the MIC determinations ( Table 2 ) , these experiments support a model in which the PmrA505 protein confers polymyxin resistance by increasing transcription of PmrA - activated genes .
Under normal growth - conditions the MICs of polymyxin for pmrA and pmrA mutant strains are the same .
During growth in LB , transcription of PmrA - activated genes is 15 to 140 times higher in a pmrA strain than in a mutant harboring a chloramphenicol resistance cassette in the pmrA gene -- pmrA : : cat ( 50 ) .
Thus , we anticipated that the MIC of polymyxin for wild - type S. typhimurium would be higher than the MIC for the pmrA : : cat mutant .
Unexpectedly , MICs for the pmrA and pmrA : : cat strains were identical ( 4 g/ml versus - 32 g/ml for the pmrA505 mutant ) , which suggests that polymyxin resistance demands expression of PmrA - activated genes to levels higher than those achieved by a wild - type organism grown in LB .
RESULTS Identification of PmrA - regulated loci required for polymyxin resistance .
We have recently established that the pbgE , pbgP , and ugd loci of S. typhimurium are transcriptionally controlled by the PmrA - PmrB regulatory system ( 50 ) .
We hypothesized that these PmrA - regulated loci may be required for polymyxin resistance because strains in which either one of these genes was inactivated could not grow on low - Mg 2 solid media ( 50 ) .
Since polymyxin must displace Mg 2 and Ca 2 ions from the LPS in order to reach its target , we reason that LPS modifications allowing growth in Mg 2 - limited conditions may also confer resistance to polymyxin and could be mediated by the same set of genes .
To ascertain the role of PmrA - regulated genes in polymyxin resistance , we determined the MIC of polymyxin B for strains harboring both the pmrA505 polymyxin resistance allele ( a His81 Arg substitution in the PmrA protein [ 41 ] ) and a MudJ transposon insertion in either pbgE , pbgP , orugd .
Inactivation of these PmrA - activated genes rendered the pmrA505 resistant mutant as susceptible as wild - type pmrA S. typhimurium ( Table 2 ) , indicating that the pbgE , pbgP , and ugd loci encode products necessary for polymyxin resistance .
The PmrA505 allele enhances expression of PmrA - activated genes .
- Galactosidase activities ( Miller units ) expressed by strains grown in LB were determined for mutants harboring a lac transcriptional - fusion to the PmrAdependent PhoP - activated genes ugd , pbgE , and pbgP and to the PmrA - independent PhoP - activated mgtA gene .
Transcriptional activity was investigated in two different backgrounds : wild type ( open bars ) and strains harboring the pmrA505 allele ( solid bars ) .
The data correspond to mean values from two independent experiments done in duplicate .
Growth in low Mg 2 and low pH renders wild - type S. typhimurium resistant to polymyxin B. Wild - type ( 14028s ) , pmrA : : cat ( EG7139 ) , and phoP mutant ( MS7953s ) strains were grown to logarithmic phase in N - minimal - medium with 10 M ( L ) or 10 mM ( H ) MgCl 2 and at either pH 7.7 or 5.8 .
Polymyxin B was added to washed bacteria at a final concentration of 2.5 ( A ) or 5.0 ( B ) g/ml , and the bacteria were incubated for1hat37 °C .
Samples were diluted in PBS and plated on LB agar plates to assess bacterial viability .

Data correspond to mean values from three independent experiments done in duplicate .
( Roland and coworkers have reported similar findings using a strain in which both the pmrA and pmrC genes were deleted [ 40 ] .
) pH and Mg 2 modulate polymyxin resistance in wild - type Salmonella .
We have recently established that expression of PmrA - activated genes is modulated by pH and the concentration of extracellular Mg 2 : PmrA - activated genes are transcriptionally induced by mild acidification and growth in micromolar concentrations of Mg 2 , whereas growth at pH 7.7 and millimolar concentrations of Mg 2 represses expression of PmrA - activated genes ( 50 ) .
We hypothesized that environmental conditions modulating transcription of PmrA - activated genes would control the phenotypic display of polymyxin resistance , and indeed , the surviving fraction of wild - type Salmonella exposed to polymyxin was 16,000 - fold higher when grown at pH - 5.8 and 10 M Mg 2 than when grown at pH 7.7 and 10 mM Mg 2 ( Fig. 2 ) .
Growth at mildly acid - pH and high Mg 2 ( i.e. , pH - 5.8 and 10 mM Mg 2 ) promoted polymyxin resistance but not to the levels achieved by incubation at low Mg 2 and mildly acid - pH ( Fig. 2 ) .
On the other hand , wildtype Salmonella displayed intermediate levels of polymyxin resistance when grown at pH 7.7 and 10 M Mg 2 ( Fig. 2 ) .
The regulatory effects of pH and Mg 2 were mediated by the PmrA protein because the pmrA : : cat mutant was sensitive to polymyxin regardless of the pH and Mg 2 concentration used to grow the microorganism ( Fig. 2 ) .
Cumulatively , these results indicate that resistance to polymyxin can be phenotypically modulated by pH and the concentration of extracellular Mg 2 in a mechanism that requires a functional PmrA protein .
pH and Mg 2 modulate polymyxin resistance in the pmrA505 polymyxin - resistant mutant .
We examined whether the polymyxin - resistant pmrA505 allele was truly constitutive by investigating whether polymyxin resistance could be modulated in this mutant by environmental cues regulating polymyxin resistance in the pmrA strain .
The surviving fraction of the pmrA505 mutant exposed to polymyxin was 2,800 times lower when grown at pH 7.7 and 10 mM Mg 2 than when grown at pH - 5.8 and 10 M Mg 2 ( Fig. 3 ) .
Still , the pmrA505 mutant displayed higher levels of polymyxin resistance than the isogenic pmrA strain under all examined conditions .
These results demonstrate that the PmrA505 protein is not blind to environmental cues and that it responds to the same signals controlling polymyxin resistance in wild - type Salmonella .
Role of the PhoP - PhoQ system in polymyxin resistance .
The PhoP - PhoQ regulatory system is absolutely required for the transcriptional induction of PmrA - activated genes that results from growth in micromolar Mg 2 .
However , PhoP - PhoQ is not essential for the acid - pH - promoted expression of PmrA - activated genes , since 20 - to 30 - fold transcriptional induction is still observed in strains mutated in either the phoP or phoQ gene ( 50 ) .
While this suggested that the PhoP - PhoQ system might not be essential for polymyxin resistance , a phoP mutant was as susceptible to polymyxin as the pmrA null mutant regardless of the pH and Mg 2 concentration used to grow the microorganism ( Fig. 2 ) .
To further examine the role of the PhoP - PhoQ system in polymyxin resistance , we investigated the polymyxin susceptibility of a phoP pmrA505 double mutant .
When grown under conditions that promote expression of PmrA - activated genes -- pH - 5.8 and 10 M Mg 2 -- the surviving fraction of phoP pmrA505 double - mutant cells exposed to polymyxin was 10,000 - fold lower than that of the isogenic phoP pmrA505 strain ( data not shown ) .
As predicted , polymyxin resistance was not modulated by changes in the extracellular concentration of Mg 2 in the phoP pmrA505 double mutant , but it could still be induced over fivefold by growth in mildly acid - pH ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that polymyxin resistance requires a functional PhoP - PhoQ system and support the notion that the PmrA505 protein responds to environmental cues .
The pmrC gene is not required for polymyxin resistance .
Because transcription of pmrC ( the first gene in the pmrCAB operon ) is regulated in the same manner as that of other PmrA - activated genes ( 50 ) , we investigated the possibility of pmrC being required for polymyxin resistance .
When grown under conditions promoting polymyxin resistance ( i.e. , pH - 5.8 and 10 M Mg 2 ) , a strain harboring a MudJ transposon insertion in the pmrC gene was as resistant to polymyxin as the wild - type parent ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , the polymyxin susceptibility of the pbgE , pbgP , and ugd mutants was similar to that of the pmrA : : cat mutant ( data not shown ) .
Cumulatively , these results indicate that the PmrC protein is not essential for polymyxin resistance and are in agreement with both the MIC data ( Table 2 ) and our previous findings that inactivation of the pmrC gene does not eliminate PmrA - dependent phenotypes such as growth on low - Mg 2 solid media ( 50 ) .

Growth in high Mg 2 and high pH renders the polymyxin - resistant pmrA505 mutant of S. typhimurium sensitive to polymyxin B. Wild - type ( EG9493 ) and pmrA505 ( EG9492 ) strains were grown to logarithmic phase in N - minimal - medium with 10 M ( L ) or 10 mM ( H ) MgCl 2 and at either pH 7.7 or 5.8 .
Polymyxin B was added to washed bacteria at a final concentration of 5.0 ( A ) or 20 ( B ) g/ml , and bacteria were incubated for 1hat37 °C .
Samples were diluted in PBS and plated on LB agar plates to assess bacterial viability .
Survival values are relative to the original inoculum .
No bacteria were recovered following treatment of the wild - type strain with 20 g of polymyxin B per ml .
Note the logarithmic scale on the y axis .
Data correspond to mean values from three independent experiments done in duplicate .
viously suggested , a promoter within the pmrC gene or the MudJ transposon may be responsible for transcription of the pmrA gene in the pmrC : : MudJ mutant [ 19 , 50 ] .
) DISCUSSION We have established that resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B is environmentally regulated by pH and the concentration of Mg 2 : growth in mildly acid - pH and micromolar Mg 2 -- conditions that promote expression of PmrA - activated genes -- rendered wild - type Salmonella resistant to polymyxin .
The regulatory effects of pH and Mg 2 required a functional PmrA - PmrB system , because these signals failed to induce polymyxin resistance in a pmrA null mutant .
Moreover , we identified three PmrA - activated loci that are necessary for polymyxin resistance and determined that they correspond to loci previously shown to be required for growth on low - Mg 2 solid media .
Modulation of polymyxin resistance .
Environmental conditions , genetic factors , and microbial growth phase modulate the phenotypic display of polymyxin resistance in S. typhimurium .
Growth in mildly acid - pH and micromolar Mg 2 increased the surviving fraction of wild - type Salmonella exposed to polymyxin 16,000 times more than organisms grown in mildly alkaline - pH and millimolar concentrations of Mg 2 ( Fig. 2 ) .
Survival in the presence of polymyxin could be induced 120 - fold by growing wild - type Salmonella in micromolar Mg 2 , whereas mild acidification increased survival in the presence of polymyxin 3,500 fold ( Fig. 2 ) .
These results are in agreement with the increased bacterial tolerance towards polymyxin resulting from either adaptation of wild - type S. typhimurium to pH - 5.8 for one or two cell doublings ( 27 ) or growth in the presence of very low concentrations of divalent cations ( cited in reference 24 ) .
Our experiments with pmrA and phoP mutants suggest a model in which polymyxin resistance requires a threshold level of transcription of PmrA - activated genes below which a wildtype organism can not resist polymyxin - mediated killing .
First , pmrA and pmrA strains were equally susceptible to polymyxin when grown in LB ( Table 2 ) despite the 15 - to 140 - fold difference in transcription of PmrA - activated genes ( 50 ) .
Second , a phoP mutant was as susceptible to polymyxin as the pmrA null mutant ( Fig. 2 ) even though transcription of PmrA - activated genes can be stimulated 20 - fold by growth in mildly acid - pH in a phoP mutant ( 50 ) .
Finally , wild - type Salmonella displayed polymyxin resistance only when grown under conditions that promoted high levels of transcription of PmrA - activated genes ( 50 ) .
The PhoP - PhoQ system has been shown to control lipid - A modifications independently of the PmrA protein ( 20 ) .
While the role that these modifications play in resistance to polymyxin remains unknown , it raises the possibility of the PhoP - PhoQ system contributing to polymyxin resistance not only by promoting high levels of expression of PmrA - activated genes but also by governing transcription of PmrA - independent resistance determinants .
In addition to the regulatory signals promoting polymyxin resistance in logarithmically growing cells , bacteria that reach stationary - phase in LB or that stop growing because of starvation for carbon , nitrogen , or phosphorus exhibit heightened resistance to polymyxin ( 30 ) .
Starvation - promoted resistance does not require the stationary - phase RpoS sigma factor but is dependent on the phoP gene shortly after the onset of starvation ( 30 ) .
It is presently unknown whether PhoP - mediated resistance is dependent on a functional PmrA protein , because starvation - promoted polymyxin resistance has not been examined in mutants lacking the pmrA gene .
The multiple regulatory signals controlling polymyxin resistance indicate that the LPS structure is not static but rather is modifiable in response to environmental cues .
That these LPS modifications may take place within host cells and enhance resistance to antimicrobial proteins and peptides is suggested by the following .
First , the phagosomes harboring Salmonella are known to be acidic ( 1 ) and low in Mg 2 ( 11 ) .
Second , the PmrA - regulated gene ugd/pagA is activated within acidified phagosomes ( 1 ) .
And third , growth within cultured mammalian cells promotes changes in the peptidoglycan structure of S. typhimurium ( 39 ) .
The PmrA505 protein can respond to external cues .
It has been hypothesized that cells harboring the pmrA505 allele ( a His81 Arg substitution in the regulatory protein PmrA ) are resistant to polymyxin - because they constitutively overexpress PmrA - regulated determinants ( 41 ) , and indeed , transcription of PmrA - activated genes is four - to eightfold higher in the pmrA505 mutant than in the pmrA strain ( Fig. 1 ) .
However , survival of the pmrA505 mutant in the presence of polymyxin 7044 GROISMAN ET AL. .
was 2,800 - fold lower when the strain was grown in alkaline pH and millimolar Mg 2 concentrations ( Fig. 3 ) , indicating that this mutant responds to the same environmental cues that modulate polymyxin resistance in wild - type Salmonella ( Fig. 2 ) .
These results suggest that the PmrB protein -- the putative cognate sensor - kinase for the PmrA protein -- may exhibit phosphatase activity towards the PmrA protein .
Alternatively or in addition , the phosphorylated state of the PmrA protein may be environmentally controlled by phosphoprotein phosphatases analogous to those modulating the activity of the CpxR - CpxA and RcsB - RscC two - component systems in E. coli K - 12 ( 34 ) .
Role of PmrA - regulated determinants in resistance to antimicrobial peptides and proteins .
Polymyxin - resistant pmrA mutants bind less polymyxin than wild - type organisms ( 53 , 55 ) because their LPS has a higher substitution of the ester - linked phosphate group in lipid - A by 4 - amino - 4-deoxy - L-arabinose and contains larger amounts of 2 - aminoethanol esterifying phosphates in the core oligosaccharide ( 24 , 29 , 54 ) .
Since different enzymes are anticipated to participate in the biosynthesis and/or incorporation of these substituents into the LPS , Roland and coworkers suggested that at least two PmrA - regulated determinants would be required for polymyxin resistance ( 41 ) .
We have now identified three PmrA - activated loci that are essential for polymyxin resistance : pbgE , pbgP , and ugd .
These loci are in addition to pmrD , a gene that confers polymyxin resistance when present in a multicopy plasmid and that appears to be regulated by the PmrA - PmrB system because pmrD - mediated polymyxin resistance is not observed in a mutant lacking the pmrA gene ( 40 ) .
Consistent with a potential role in LPS modification , the ugd gene maps to one of the LPS biosynthetic gene clusters in enteric bacteria and encodes a protein that is homologous to the UDP - glucose dehydrogenase of Streptococcus pneumoniae , where it is essential for capsule production ( 7 , 8 ) .
On the other hand , the pmrD gene encodes an 85 - amino - acid polypeptide that exhibits similarity to a protease of Rous sarcoma virus ( 40 ) .
The pmrD gene does not confer resistance to CAP57 ( 40 ) , which , like polymyxin , targets the lipid - A portion of the LPS , suggesting that the PmrD protein may mediate polymyxin resistance by a mechanism that does not involve modification of the lipid - A .
Polymyxin resistance and adaptation to low - Mg 2 environments .
The pbgE , pbgP , and ugd loci are essential for both resistance to polymyxin ( Table 2 ) and growth on low - Mg 2 solid media ( 49 ) , suggesting that the PmrA - regulated LPS modifications associated with polymyxin resistance are part of a cellular response governing the adaptation to Mg 2 - limited environments .
When exposed to a low - Mg 2 milieu , Salmonella upregulates the expression of several genes , including those encoding the high - affinity Mg 2 transporters MgtA and MgtB ( 13 , 49 ) .
This promotes uptake of Mg 2 into the cytoplasm to maintain the Mg 2 concentration that is necessary for the various ATP - dependent reactions .
But where is the Mg 2 coming from ?
We suggest ( i ) that the LPS serves as a Mg 2 reservoir and is the main source of Mg 2 when bacteria face Mg 2 - limited environments and ( ii ) that the PmrA - controlled modifications of the LPS neutralize negative charges normally neutralized by Mg 2 and Ca 2 ions .
E. coli K - 12 cells grown in nutrient broth contain approximately 1 mol of Ca 2 and 2 to 3 mol of Mg 2 per mol of LPS ( 4 ) .
The Ca 2 content is similar in cells grown in M9 - minimal - medium , whereas the Mg 2 content increases some 30 % to 4 mol of Mg 2 per mol of LPS ( 4 ) .
In S. typhimurium , the number of LPS molecules is 35 10 5 per cell ( 35 ) and there are 2 10 9 cells per mg of dry weight .
If one uses the value of 4 mol of Mg 2 per LPS molecule determined for M9 - grown E. coli cells ( 4 ) , it can be estimated that the LPS contains 1.12 mg of Mg 2 per g of dry weight .
Since the total Mg 2 content of E. coli is around 3.2 mg per g of dry weight ( 28 ) , these calculations imply that more than one - third of the total Mg 2 is present in the LPS .
Our model may help explain the two phenotypes associated with mutations in the pmrA locus : resistance to cationic peptides and the inability to form colonies on low - Mg 2 solid media .
Cationic antimicrobial peptides can easily displace Mg 2 and Ca 2 from the LPS because their affinities for divalent cation - binding sites in the LPS are several orders of magnitude higher than those of Mg 2 and Ca 2 ions ( 21 ) .
Then activation of the PmrA system may promote resistance to polymyxin - by neutralizing the negative charges in the LPS through covalent modification , thereby converting the LPS into a form that is an effective barrier against cationic peptides .
On the other hand , bacterial cells have a tendency to form intimate side - by - side alignments ( 46 ) , and these interactions may be hindered in strains harboring mutations in either the pmrA , pbgE , pbgP , orugd gene , which can not form colonies on low - Mg 2 solid media but grow like the wild - type parent in Mg 2 liquid media ( 50 ) .
This growth defect may be due to a failure to modify the bacterial surface charge and compensate for the absence of Mg 2 ions , resulting in electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged LPS molecules .
We thank Ken Roland for strains and Hiroshi Nikaido for the calculations on the Mg 2 content of the LPS .
