Indole demonstrated to affect gene expression in Escherichia coli as an intra - species signaling - molecule .
In contrast to E. coli , Salmonella does not produce indole because it does not harbor tnaA , which encodes the enzyme responsible for tryptophan metabolism .
Our previous study demonstrated that E. coli - conditioned - medium and indole induce expression of the AcrAB multidrug efflux pump in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium for inter - species communication ; however , the global effect of indole on genes in Salmonella remains unknown .
Results : To understand the complete picture of genes regulated by indole , we performed DNA microarray analysis of genes in the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028s affected by indole .
Predicted Salmonella phenotypes affected by indole based on the microarray data were also examined in this study .
Indole induced expression of genes related to efflux - mediated multidrug resistance , including ramA and acrAB , and repressed those related to host cell invasion encoded in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 , and flagella production .
Reduction of invasive activity and motility of Salmonella by indole was also observed phenotypically .
Conclusion : Our results suggest that indole is an important signaling - molecule for inter - species communication to control drug resistance and virulence of S. enterica .
Background Bacteria communicate using small molecules by a process termed quorum - sensing .
Accumulation of quorum - sensing signals in growth medium indicates cell density .
The use of chemical signals for bacterial communication is a widespread phenomenon [ 1 - 5 ] .
In Gram - negative bacteria , these signals could be N - acyl derivatives of homoserine lactone , cyclic dipeptides , and quinolones [ 6 - 12 ] .
These signals regulate various functions such as bioluminescence , differentiation , virulence , DNA transfer , and biofilm maturation [ 13 - 22 ] .

Among Enterobacteriaceae , indole is produced by E. coli and certain Proteeae such as Proteus vulgaris , Providencia spp. , and Morganella spp. [ 26 ] .
Indole production is commonly used for Escherichia coli identification [ 26 ] .
Indole is generated from tryptophan by the enzyme tryptophanase , encoded by tnaA [ 27 ] .
Extracellular indole is found at high concentrations ( over 600 μM ) when E. coli is grown in enriched medium [ 28 ] .
Furthermore , indole has also been found in human feces at comparable concentrations ( ~ 250 -- 1100 μM ) [ 29,30 ] .
Recent studies have also revealed that indole is an extracellular signal in E. coli , since it has been demonstrated to regulate uptake , synthesis , and degradation of amino - acids in the stationary phase of planktonic - cells [ 31 ] , multicopy plasmid Commons Attribution License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0 ) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is properly cited .

Indole has also been demonstrated as an important cell - signaling - molecule for a population - based antibiotic resistance mechanism [ 39 ] .
Salmonella enterica is a bacterial pathogen that causes various diseases in humans including gastroenteritis , bacteremia , and typhoid fever [ 40 ] .
In contrast to E. coli , S. enterica does not harbor tnaA ; therefore , this organism does not produce indole [ 41 ] .
In our previous study , we demonstrated that an E. coli - conditioned - medium and indole induced expression of the acrAB -- tolC multidrug efflux system of Salmonella in a RamA regulatordependent manner [ 35 ] .
This suggests that indole is used as a cell - signaling - molecule in both intra - and interspecies communication .
However , the global effect of indole on Salmonella remains to be elucidated .
We hypothesized that indole controls expression of a wide range of genes and plays a role in regulating the physiological functions of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium .
Therefore , to reveal the complete picture of indolecontrolled genes , we conducted microarray analysis of genes affected by indole .
Predicted Salmonella phenotypes affected by indole based on the microarray data were also examined in this study .
Methods Bacterial strains and growth - conditions S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains used in this study were the wild - type strain ATCC14028s [ 42 ] and its derivatives .
These included strain NES114 which harbors a FLAG - tag fused at the chromosomal ramA gene ( ramA - FLAG : : Km R ) and strain NES84 which carries a ramA reporter plasmid ( ATCC 14028s/pNNramA ) [ 35 ] .
Derivatives also included various deletion mutants : ramA deletion mutant 14028sΔramA : : kan R , ramR deletion mutant 14028sΔramR : : kan R and mutant 14028sΔram : : kan R deleted of the whole ram locus .
Bacterial strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) broth supplemented with indole ( Sigma ) where appropriate .
DNA microarray analysis The ATCC 14028s strain was grown in the presence or absence of 1 or 4 mM indole .
The cells were rapidly collected for total RNA extraction when the culture reached an optical density ( OD ) of 0.6 at 600 nm .
Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the RNeasy Midi kit ( Qiagen ) and Turbo DNA - free ™ kit ( Ambion ) .
After extraction of total RNA , fluorescent labeling of cDNA was performed using the GeneChip DNA labeling reagents ( Affimetrix ) .
The fluorescent - labeled cDNA was hybridized in cDNA microarray plates ( NimbleExpress ™ S. typhimurium array ; NimbleGen Systems , Inc. ) .
The degree of fluorescence in the plates was measured and quantified using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 ( Affymetrix ) and GeneChip Operating Software ver .
Measured values were compared to control values , and p values of distribution of logged data were obtained .
A ranked conversion of p values was calculated , and values lying inside 2.5 % of the two extremes were considered valid .
Semiquantitative RT - PCR The ATCC 14028s strain was grown in the presence or absence of 2 mM indole .
The cells were rapidly collected for total RNA extraction when the culture reached an OD 600 of 0.6 .
Total RNA from bacterial cultures was extracted as described above .
Semiquantitative RT - PCR was used to measure the transcriptional expression of rrs and ramA .
RNA was reverse - transcribed using random hexamers and TaqMan reverse transcription reagents ( Applied Biosystems ) , and PCR was performed using Takara LA Taq DNA polymerase ( Takara Bio , Inc. ) .
The primers for rrs were rrs - F and rrs - R ( Table 1 ) and those for ramA were ramA - F and ramA - R ( Table 1 ) .
β - Galactosidase assay The NES84 strain [ 35 ] was grown in the presence of 0 -- 3 mM indole until an OD 600 of 0.6 was reached .
β - Galactosidase activity was determined as described by Miller [ 43 ] .
All assays were performed in triplicate .
Construction of the ramA - FLAG strain Insertion of the FLAG - tag of the ramA gene 3 ' terminal was performed as described by Datsenko and Wanner [ 44 ] .
The kanamycin resistance gene aph , flanked by Flp recognition sites , was amplified by PCR using the primers ramA - FLAG - forward ( GCCAGGCGCTTATCGTA AAGAAAAGCATGGCCGTACGCATGACTACAAGG ACGACGATGACAAGTAGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGC TTC ) and ramA - FLAG - reverse ( CGATTAAACATTTC AATGCGTACGGCCATGCTTTTCTTTACATATGAAT ATCCTCCTTAG ) .
The sequence of the FLAG - tag appears in bold in the sequence of the ramA - FLAG - forward primer .
The resulting PCR products were used to transform the recipient ATCC 14028s strain harboring the pKD46 plasmid , which expresses Red recombinase [ 44 ] .
The chromosomal structure of the mutated loci was verified by PCR .
Western blotting The NES114 strain ( ramA - FLAG : : Km R ) was grown in the presence of 2 mM indole until an OD 600 of 0.6 was reached .
Bacterial cells were washed with buffer [ 20 mM Tris -- HCl ( pH 8.0 ) , 200 mM NaCl , and 1 mM EDTA ] , resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer , and disrupted by Nikaido et al. .

The gel was transferred to PVDF membranes , and analyzed by western blotting using a monoclonal anti - FLAG antibody ( Sigma ) .
The blot was developed using anti - mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase - conjugated antibody and analyzed using the ECL detection system ( GE Healthcare ) .
Transmission electron microscopy One hundred microliters of an overnight culture of the wild - type Salmonella strain was added to 5 ml of LB broth , and the bacterial culture was grown in the presence or absence of 1 mM indole until an OD 600 of 0.6 was reached .
Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation , fixed in 2 % glutaraldehyde solution , and observed using a transmission electron microscope JEM - 2100 ( JEOL Ltd. ) .

( Qiagen ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
Removal of residual genomic DNA was performed using the Turbo DNA - free kit ( Ambion ) and examined by negative PCR amplification of a chromosomal sequence .
RNA integrity was examined by electrophoresis on 1 % agarose gel .
Total RNA was reverse - transcribed using random hexamers and the Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System ( Applied Biosystems ) .
Primers used for qRT - PCR are listed in Table 1 .
The cycling conditions were as follows : 95 °C for5minfollowedby40cyclesof95 °C for10sand60 °C for 15 s .
After each run , amplification specificity and the absence of primer dimers were examined using a dissociation curve acquired by heating the PCR products from 60 to 95 °C .
The relative quantities of transcripts were determined using the standard curve method and normalized against the geometric mean of three reference genes ( gmk , gyrB , rrs ) .
In qRT - PCR experiments performed to address the effect of 1 mM indole , the expression level of each gene of interest was calculated as the average of three independent RNA samples .
A two - tailed Student 's t - test was used to assess significance using a p value of < 0.05 as a cutoff .
Measurement of motility of Salmonella An overnight culture of the ATCC 14028s Salmonella strain was diluted in LB broth and grown in the presence or absence of 1 mM indole until an OD 600 of 0.6 was reached .
Next , 1 μl of bacterial culture was spotted in the center of a semi - solid agar plate containing 1 % tryptone peptone and 0.3 % BactoAgar and incubated at 37 °C for 3 -- 5 h in a humidified incubator , after which strains were assessed for motility .
Invasion assay Invasions assays were essentially performed as previously described [ 45 ] .
Caco - 2 cells were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % inactivated fetal bovine serum , 1 % nonessential amino - acids , and 1 % antibiotic solution ( Gibco , Invitrogen ) .
Cells harvested by trypsinization were seeded at 2 × 10 5 cells/well in a 24 - well plate ( Falcon ) and incubated for 4 days at 37 °C under 5 % CO 2 in the medium described above , to obtain a confluent monolayer .
Antibiotic was removed 24 h before performing the invasion assays .
Bacteria were grown to an OD 600 of 0.6 in LB Nikaido et al. .

After washing with DMEM , bacteria were inoculated on Caco - 2 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 30 , and the plates were further incubated for 30 min .
The bacteria - containing medium was removed from the wells , and the cells were washed with PBS .
Cells were incubated for 1.5 h with DMEM supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamicin .
Cells were washed with PBS and lysed by the addition of sterile ultrapure water for 30 min .

The percentage of penetrating bacteria was calculated on the basis of the ratio of the counted cfu to the bacterial inoculum .
For each bacterial strain and for each condition , three replicates were used .
Results Indole affects gene expression in Salmonella The regulation of Salmonella genes in the wild - type strain ATCC 14028s by 1 or 4 mM indole , was analyzed using DNA microarray .
To exclude noise data based on microarray analysis , we considered that genes for which expression changed in the presence of both 1 and 4 mM of indole were significantly regulated by indole .
As a result , it was revealed that 24 ( Table 2 ) and 53 genes ( Table 3 ) were upregulated and downregulated by indole , respectively .
Genes upregulated by indole Expression of the 24 genes listed in Table 2 was upregulated by both 1 and 4 mM indole .
Eighteen genes are considered to code for putative proteins , and four genes , ramA , ydiP , yhjB , and bglJ , are regulatory in nature .
The transcriptional activator RamA , which belongs to the AraC/XylS family of regulatory proteins , promotes multidrug resistance by increasing expression of the AcrAB -- TolC multidrug efflux system in several pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae [ 35,46 - 53 ] .
RamA has also been reported to negatively affect virulence [ 47 ] .
Both YdiP and YhjB are putative transcription regulators that belong to the AraC and LuxR/UhpA families , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
YhjB is considered a response regulator Table 2 Salmonella genes whose relative expression was increased by indole STM no .

YhjB in E. coli stimulates dephosphorylation of two histidine kinases , EnvZ and NtrB , although the sensor kinase for YhjB phosphorylation has not yet been identified [ 54 ] .
BglJ forms a heterodimer with RcsB to relieve repression of the E. coli bgl operon and allow arbutin and salicin transport and utilization [ 55,56 ] .
Expression of all these regulatory genes increased by more than 10 - fold in the presence of indole .
Of particular interest , expression of ramA increased by 39 - fold in response to 4 mM indole .
Noticeably , higher indole concentration did not always lead to a higher expression level .
Indeed , bglJ expression was more increased in response to 1 mM indole ( 26 - fold ) than to 4 mM indole ( 5.7 - fold ) .
Among other genes upregulated by indole , functions of the gene products of entD , fruF , bfd , and fxsA have been characterized .
EntD has phosphopantetheinyl transferase activity [ 57 ] and is involved in biosynthesis of the ironacquiring siderophore enterobactin [ 58 ] .
FruF is a bifunctional PTS system fructose - specific transporter subunit IIA/HPr protein [ 41,59 ] .
Bfd is a bacterioferritinassociated ferredoxin considered to be involved in Bfr iron storage and release functions or in regulation of Bfr [ 41 ] .
FxsA of E. coli was described as a suppressor of the F exclusion of phage T7 [ 60 ] .
Expression of all these genes was more strongly induced by 4 mM indole than by 1 mM indole .
Genes downregulated by indole Microarray analysis revealed that fifty - three genes were repressed by both 1 and 4 mM indole ( Table 3 ) .
Expression of all these genes excluding STM4258 and nrdD was reduced by 4 mM indole compared to that by 1 mM indole .
Although there are 10 putative genes , functions of most gene products have been characterized ( Table 3 ) .
Microarray analysis revealed that indole represses expression of genes related to bacterial motility including flagella biosynthesis ( flgN/K/L and fliD/S/T ) , chemotaxis ( cheB/R/M / A , aer [ 61 ] , tcp , and trg ) , and flagella motor activity ( motB/A ) .
Indole also decreased expression of genes related to cell invasion such as prgJ/I/H , sipB , and invE/F , which are encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) .
Expression of genes related to anaerobic respiration was decreased by indole .
The genes repressed by indole included narG ( nitrate reductase ) , narK ( nitrate - nitrite antiporter ) , and genes in the nap operon encoding nitrate reductase ( Nap ) such as napB / H/G/A / D/F [ 62 ] .
The tdc operon including tdcA/B/C / D , which are responsible for the anaerobic degradation of threonine [ 63 ] , was also downregulated by indole .
In addition to these genes , other genes related to anaerobic respiration such as dmsA/B ( anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase ) , fumB ( fumarase B , anaerobic isozyme ) , nrdD ( anaerobic ribonucleoside - triphosphate reductase ) , and STM4305/4306 ( putative anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase , subunit A/B ) were also repressed by indole .
Indole also repressed membrane protein genes such as ompW ( outer membrane protein involved in osmoregulation that is also affected by environmental conditions ) and dppF/C ( dipeptide transport protein ) .
Indole upregulates genes involved in efflux - mediated multidrug resistance As reported above , microarray analysis identified that indole significantly increased expression of ramA , encoding a transcriptional activator of the multidrug transporter genes acrAB and tolC of Salmonella [ 35 ] .
To confirm this result , we performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) and observed that transcript levels of ramA increased when bacterial cells of the strain ATCC 14028s were treated with 2 mM indole ( Figure 1A - 1 ) .
To investigate whether indole induces production of RamA , we constructed a strain NES114 that harbors a FLAG - tag fused to chromosomallyencoded ramA .
Western blotting revealed increased production of RamA in the presence of 2 mM indole ( Figure 1A - 2 ) .
Microarray analysis demonstrated that expression of ramA was more strongly induced by 4 mM indole ( 39 - fold increase relative to untreated cells ) than by 1 mM Nikaido et al. .

indole ( 7.0 - fold increase ) , indicating that the effect of indole on expression of ramA may be concentration dependent .
To investigate the effect of different indole concentrations on the promoter activity of ramA , a β - galactosidase assay with the NES84 strain [ 35 ] was performed , and it was found that indole activated the ramA promoter in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 1B ) .
The finding of enhanced promoter activity of ramA is in good agreement with our previous observation [ 35 ] .
Confirming classical RT - PCR results , quantitative RT - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) indicated that expression of ramA in the strain ATCC 14028s increases by 4 - fold in the presence of 1 mM indole ( Figure 1C - 1 ) .
As previously reported , RamR represses to the same extent the expression of ramA [ 46,64 ] .
Therefore , to determine a possible contribution of RamR to induction of expression of ramA via indole , the effect of 1 mM indole on expression of ramA in a ΔramR strain ( 14028sΔramR : : kan R ) was examined .
At this concentration indole did not induce Nikaido et al. .
Gut Pathogens 2012 , 4:5 Page 8 of 13 http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/4/1/5 expression of ramA suggesting indole - mediated ramA induction is indeed dependent on the presence of RamR ( Figure 1C - 1 ) .
However , whereas indole was shown to induce expression of acrB in the wild - type strain , this induction was neither observed in the ΔramR ( 14028sΔramR : : kan R ) nor in the ΔramA strain ( 14028sΔramA : : kan R ) ( Figure 1C - 2 ) .
This suggested that indole - mediated induction of acrB expression is not solely dependent on RamA , but nevertheless also requires the presence of the RamR transcriptional repressor .
Indole represses motility of Salmonella Expression of genes related to bacterial flagella biosynthesis , flagella motor activity , and chemotaxis was repressed by indole , and this repression was predicted to have profound negative effects on flagellar synthesis and bacterial motility .
FlhC is a master regulator protein involved in flagellar biogenesis in Salmonella [ 65 ] .
Indole also reduced expression of flhC , and this reduction was independent of ramA and ramR ( Figure 2A ) .
To confirm the microarray findings , we examined the effect of indole on the presence of flagella in wild - type Salmonella cells by transmission electron microscopy ( Figure 2B ) .
Flagella were detectable in bacterial cells regardless of indole treatment ; however , the number of flagella decreased when cells were treated with indole ( Figure 2B and C ) .
It was observed that motility of Salmonella ATCC 14028s strain decreased in the semi - solid agar plate when bacterial cells were treated with indole ( Figure 2D ) .
These results suggest that the reduction in the number of flagella by indole may affect motility of Salmonella .
Indole represses expression of the invasion genes Inside the host , S. enterica serovars can invade and survive in epithelial cells and macrophages .
Therefore , invasion of the host intestinal cells is critical for initiation of salmonellosis .
Several genetic elements responsible for the invasive phenotype of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium are located in SPI - 1 , a 40 - kbp region of the chromosome at centrisome 63 .
As described above , we found that genes located in SPI - 1 such as prgJ/I/H , sipB , and invE/F were repressed by indole .
To further investigate repression of SPI - 1 genes by indole , we measured expression of hilA , sipA , invA , and invF of the ATCC 14028s strain in response to different indole concentration by qRT - PCR ( Figure 3 ) .
hilA is located on SPI - 1 , and it encodes the HilA regulator , which controls Figure 2 Indole represses flagella production and motility of Salmonella .
( A ) The effect of indole on expression of flhC measured by qRT - PCR .
The wild - type strain ATCC 14028s and its ramR : : kan R and ramA : : kan R deletion mutants were grown in the presence ( + ) or absence ( − ) of 1 mM indole .
flhC expression level was expressed relative to that measured in the wild - type strain grown without indole , which was assigned the unit value .
The data corresponds to mean values from three independent replicates .
The bars indicate the standard deviation .
( B ) Transmission electron microscopy was used to detect flagella on the wild - type strain ( ATCC 14028s ) grown in the presence or absence of 1 mM indole .

Data were collected from 30 bacterial cells for both indole - treated and untreated cells .

( D ) Indole represses motility of Salmonella .
After incubation of the wild - type ATCC 14028s strain in the presence or absence of 1 mM indole , motility was assayed on a semi - solid agar plate .
Result is representative of one of the three experiments .
Gut Pathogens 2012 , 4:5 Page 9 of 13 http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/4/1/5 Figure 3 Indole represses expression of invasion genes encoded by SPI - 1 .
The effect of indole on expression of SPI - 1 genes including hilA ( A ) , sipA ( B ) , invA ( C ) , and invF ( D ) was measured by qRT - PCR .
The wild - type ATCC 14028s strain ( open bars ) and its ramA : : kan R deletion mutant ( solid bars ) were grown with indole concentrations between 0 and 1 mM .
Genes expression levels were expressed relative to that measured in the wild - type strain grown without indole , which was assigned the unit value .
expression of SPI - 1 genes , including the type III secretion system ( T3SS ) .
invF also encodes an invasion regulatory protein of SPI - 1 .
sipA encodes an effector protein , the secretion of which is mediated by T3SS .
invA encodes a structural component of T3SS .
qRT - PCR revealed that indole decreased expression of hilA , sipA , invA , and invF in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 3 ) .
Since it was reported that overexpression of ramA results in decreased expression of SPI - 1 genes [ 47 ] and our study indicated that indole induces ramA , we investigated the effect of ramA deletion on expression of SPI - 1 genes regulated by indole .
As shown in Figure 3 , indole repressed expression of hilA , sipA , invA , and invF ; however , its repressive effect on those in the ramA - deleted mutant ( 14028sΔramA : : kan R ) was slightly lower than that observed in the wild - type strain ( ATCC 14028s ) when bacterial cells were treated with 0.125 or 0.25 mM indole .
In contrast , when bacterial cells were treated with concentrations of indole of 0.35 mM or more , the repressive effect on SPI - 1 genes was similar in the wild - type and in the mutant strains .
These data suggest that indole partially represses SPI - 1 genes in a RamA - dependent manner when cells are treated with lower indole concentrations ; however , the repressive effect of indole on SPI - 1 may be RamA - independent at higher concentrations .
A critical step in Salmonella pathogenesis is invasion of enterocytes and M cells of the small intestine via expression of a type III secretion system encoded by SPI - 1 that secretes effector proteins into host cells , leading to engulfment of bacteria within large membrane ruffles .
As indicated previously , indole represses expression of genes encoded by SPI - 1 , suggesting that indole reduces invasion of mammalian cells by Salmonella .
To examine this possibility , we investigated the effect of indole in an invasion assay using Caco - 2 cells .
When bacterial cells were treated with 1 mM indole , the invasion rate of Salmonella was reduced compared to that in untreated bacterial cells ( Figure 4 ) .
We also examined the effect of deletions of ramR and of the whole ram locus on invasive activity of Salmonella treated with 1 mM indole .

invasive activity of the ΔramR ( 14028sΔramR : : kan R ) and of the Δram mutant ( 14028sΔram : : kan R ) , as observed with the wild - type strain ( Figure 4 ) .
These data suggest that 1 mM indole phenotypically represses invasive Discussion Increasing evidence indicates that indole controls various phenotypes of E. coli including multidrug resistance and virulence as an extracellular signal [ 28,31 - 34,37 - 39 ] .
In contrast to E. coli , the effect of indole on Salmonella had not been clearly elucidated , probably because Salmonella does not produce indole .
Therefore , we sought to resolve the effect of indole on gene expression in the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028s strain by microarray analysis .
As hypothesized and confirmed in previous studies [ 35,36 ] , microarray analysis revealed that indole increased expression of ramA , which is involved in regulation of the AcrAB -- TolC multidrug efflux system .
Including ramA , 24 genes were upregulated by indole .
Among them , 18 were more strongly induced by 4 mM indole than by 1 mM indole .
Conversely , 53 genes were downregulated by indole , 51 of which were more strongly repressed by 4 mM indole than by 1 mM indole .
These data suggested that expression of most indoleregulated genes is indole concentration dependent .
In fact , promoter activity of ramA increased as indole Figure 5 Proposed regulatory network controlled by indole .
Indole induces the multidrug efflux system genes acrAB and tolC through the increased expression of ramA .
Indole represses flagellar and SPI - 1 genes in a ram locus - independent manner .
However , the indole - mediated upregulation of ramA may be partially involved in decreased expression of SPI - 1 genes .
Gut Pathogens 2012 , 4:5 Page 11 of 13 http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/4/1/5 concentration increased .
Similarly , expression of SPI - 1 genes decreased as indole concentration increased .
Indole induced ramA , and this induction is probably responsible for induction of acrB , which encodes the multidrug efflux pump ( Figure 5 ) .
Most of the genes upregulated by indole encode putative proteins .
Several of the genes , such as STM1251 , STM1472 , STM1868A , STM3941 , and STM4213 , have yet to be named .
Among these , the only gene identified in E. coli is STM4213 , which encodes a putative phage tail sheath protein .
If the function of these putative genes is clarified , then other phenotypes induced by indole in addition to multidrug resistance will also be understood .
In this study , we found that indole repressed various genes related to bacterial motility and virulence .
Decreased motility and invasive activity of Salmonella were also phenotypically observed .
Recent studies revealed the coordinate regulation of flagellar and SPI - 1 genes by FliZ , encoded by a gene in the fliA operon [ 66,67 ] .
It was demonstrated that FliZ posttranslationally controls HilD to positively regulate expression of hilA [ 67 ] .
Our microarray data revealed reduced expression of fliZ when bacterial cells were treated with indole ( fliZ expression was reduced to 0.47 - and 0.038 - fold of the level in untreated cells by 1 and 4 mM indole , respectively ) , and that expression of hilA was also repressed by indole .
Indole may coordinately repress flagellar and SPI - 1 genes via the regulatory network of FliZ .
Because previous study indicated that both RamA and RamR are involved in the control of SPI - 1 genes [ 47 ] , we examined their effects on repression of SPI - 1 genes and invasive activity of Salmonella .
The results suggested that indole suppresses SPI - 1 genes in a RamA/RamR - independent manner ( Figure 5 ) .
Similarly , repression of flhC by indole was also RamA/RamR independent .
These data are suggestive of the presence of another pathway for indole to repress flagellar and SPI - 1 genes , whereas acrAB/tolC is induced by indole in a RamR/RamA - dependent manner .
Bacterial adhesion to the Caco - 2 cells , which is the primary step of the cell invasion process , was not addressed in our experiments .
However , since flagella were repressed by indole , it can not be excluded that the defective invasion partially resulted from a lesser adhesion to the cells , and not only to the repression of SPI - 1 genes .
It should also be noted that several of the indole - repressed genes are related to anaerobic respiration in addition to motility and SPI - 1 genes .
Because it is suggested that indole is a biological oxidant in bacteria [ 68 ] , this oxidative effect may lead to repression of these genes .
In conclusion , we identified that indole induces expression of genes related to efflux - mediated multidrug resistance and represses expression of genes related to invasive activity and motility of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium .
Reduction of invasive activity and motility of Salmonella by indole was phenotypically observed .
Because Salmonella itself does not produce indole , our results suggest that indole could also be an important signaling - molecule for inter - species communication to control drug resistance and virulence of Salmonella in addition to its role in intra - species communication in E. coli .
Indeed , it was previously demonstrated that E. coli - conditioned - medium induced the AcrAB pump in Salmonella through the RamA regulator [ 35 ] .
The type of environment in which Salmonella experiences the effect of indole is not well understood .
It is believed that Salmonella may be exposed to high indole concentrations in the intestine , in which several species of indole - producing bacteria exist .
In fact , indole is found in human feces at comparable concentrations ( ~ 250 -- 1100 μM ) [ 29,30 ] , and recent studies indicated the importance of indole in favorable inter - kingdom signaling interactions between the intestinal epithelial cells and commensal bacteria [ 69 ] .
In addition to indole itself , indole derivatives such as skatole ( 3 - methylindole ) also occur naturally in feces after being produced from tryptophan in the mammalian digestive tract .
Therefore , indole and skatole may additively affect gene expression in Salmonella .
In fact , when we examined the effect of skatole by a β - galactosidase assay , it significantly stimulated the promoter activity of ramA ( unpublished data ) .
Thus , there is a possibility that these molecules enhance drug resistance of Salmonella , while simultaneously repressing their motility and pathogenicity in the intestinal tract .
Interestingly , the effect of indole on the pathogenicity of E. coli is the opposite of that on Salmonella .
In enterohemorrhagic E. coli , it was suggested that indole can activate expression of EspA and EspB as well as secretion and stimulate the ability of EHEC to form attaching and effacing lesions in human cells [ 38 ] .
Thus , although indole secreted by E. coli enhances the virulence of E. coli , it reduces the virulence of Salmonella , probably to the advantage of E. coli .
This finding suggests that the gastrointestinal flora may affect regulation of virulence traits in Salmonella via the signaling of indole .
