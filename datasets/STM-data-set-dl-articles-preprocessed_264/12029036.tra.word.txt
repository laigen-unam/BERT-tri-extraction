Brodsky , 1 * Robert K. Ernst , 2 Samuel I. Miller , 2 and Stanley Falkow 1 Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , California 94305 , 1 and Departments of Microbiology and Medicine , University of Washington , Seattle , Washington 98195 2 It was previously demonstrated that the mig - 14 gene of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is necessary for bacterial proliferation in the liver and spleen of mice following intragastric inoculation and that mig - 14 expression , which is induced within macrophages , is under the control of the global regulator PhoP .
Here we demonstrate that the mig - 14 promoter is induced by growth in minimal - medium containing low magnesium or acidic pH , consistent with regulation by PhoP .
In addition , mig - 14 is strongly induced by polymyxin B , protamine , and the mammalian antimicrobial peptide protegrin - 1 .
While phoP is necessary for the induction of mig - 14 in response to protamine and protegrin , mig - 14 is still induced by polymyxin B in a phoP background .
We also demonstrate that mig - 14 is necessary for resistance of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium to both polymyxin B and protegrin - 1 .
Gram - negative resistance to a variety of antimicrobial peptides has been correlated with modifications of lipopolysaccharide structure .
However , we show that mig - 14 is not required for one of these modifications , the addition of 4 - aminoarabinose to lipid - A .
Additionally , sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of wild - type and mig - 14 lipopolysaccharide also shows no detectable differences between the two strains .
Therefore , mig - 14 contributes to Salmonella resistance to antimicrobial peptides by a mechanism that is not yet fully understood .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a gram - negative facultative intracellular pathogen that causes self - limiting gastroenteritis in humans and a disease resembling systemic typhoid fever in mice .
After being ingested , Salmonella traverses the stomach and invades M cells in the Peyer 's patches of the small intestinal epithelium ( 46 ) .
After invasion , the bacteria are engulfed by host macrophages ( 5 , 22 ) in which they survive and replicate within a specialized compartment known as the Salmonella - containing vacuole ( 2 ) .
The two - component regulatory system encoded by the phoPQ operon is required for the ability of Salmonella to survive and replicate within these phagocytes ( 7 , 29 ) .
Gram - negative bacteria frequently utilize two - component systems consisting of a sensor kinase and a DNA binding component to sense and respond to a variety of conditions , including changes in pH , ion concentration , and osmolarity .
The survival of Salmonella in different host environments requires coordinate regulation of many gene products in response to these changing environmental conditions .
The PhoQ sensor kinase responds to changes in the concentration of Mg 2 ions and phosphorylates its cognate response regulator PhoP in environments containing micromolar concentrations of Mg 2 ( 10 , 41 ) .
PhoP in turn activates a number of genes , including those necessary for intracellular survival and antimicrobial peptide resistance ( 8 , 31 ) .
Antimicrobial peptides are an essential aspect of host innate immune defense and are produced by macrophages , neutrophils , and mucosal epithelial cells ( 18 ) .
These peptides are and Immunology , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA 94305 .
small ( 2 to 4 kDa ) cationic molecules of various structural classes that bind to and permeabilize bacterial membranes .
Within host tissues , Salmonella is likely to encounter antimicrobial peptides in the intestine , where Paneth cells constitutively secrete them , as well as within the host cell phagosomes that fuse with antimicrobial peptide - containing vesicles ( 34 , 38 ) .
The ability of pathogenic bacteria to resist killing by host antimicrobial peptides present in different host niches may therefore contribute to their virulence .
Salmonella resistance to antimicrobial peptides is frequently mediated by modifications to the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) component of the bacterial outer membrane .
Complete LPS consists of an endotoxic component , lipid - A , which is linked to a polysaccharide molecule consisting of a core oligosaccharide and a repeating sugar structure known as the O antigen ( 35 ) .
Environmentally induced modifications to the structure of lipid A are correlated with resistance to several classes of antimicrobial peptides .
For example , substitution of the 4 phosphate with 4 - aminoarabinose has been shown to be important for resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B ( PB ) ( 13 ) .
Recently , it has been demonstrated that both 4 and 1 phosphates can be substituted with aminoarabinose ( 47 ) , although substitution at the 4 phosphate is what has been correlated with resistance .
PB is an amphipathic cationic molecule that binds to LPS and permeabilizes the outer and inner membranes of gram - negative bacteria by a mechanism thought to be similar to that of antimicrobial peptides ( 44 , 49 ) .
Thus , resistance to PB often confers cross - resistance to some classes of mammalian antimicrobial peptides in - vitro ( 39 ) and correlates with increased survival of Salmonella in neutrophils ( 43 ) .
4 - Aminoarabinose addition to lipid - A and the addition of ethanolamine are controlled by a second two - component regulatory system encoded by pmrAB ( 13 ) .
The response regulator 3203 3204 BRODSKY ET AL. .
PmrA is regulated indirectly by PhoP through the PmrD protein ( 26 ) .
In addition , the PhoP - PhoQ system coordinately regulates several other unlinked loci involved in different LPS modifications that confer resistance to a number of structurally unrelated antimicrobial peptides ( 16 , 17 ) .
Therefore , phoP mutants of Salmonella are highly sensitive to multiple classes of antimicrobial peptides due to an inability to generate several modified forms of LPS .
In addition to LPS modifications , changes in expression of outer membrane proteins also play a role in conferring resistance to antimicrobial peptides .
For example , the outer membrane protease PgtE has been shown to cleave alpha - helical antimicrobial peptides and is also regulated by the PhoP - PhoQ system ( 12 ) .
Furthermore , the rck gene found on the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium virulence plasmid encodes an outer membrane protein that confers increased resistance to complement killing when overexpressed in Escherichia coli ( 19 ) .
A recent screen in our laboratory for genes that can restore PB resistance to the mig - 14 mutant identified rck ( unpublished data ) .
Although rck is not known to be regulated by PhoP , it is coexpressed in - vitro with Salmonella genes that are induced within the macrophage vacuole ( C. Detweiler and S. Falkow , unpublished data ) .
We examined the regulation and function of the Salmonella gene mig - 14 , which is dependent on PhoP for transcriptional activation within cultured macrophages ( 53 ) and contributes to oral virulence in mice ( 51 ) .
We demonstrate here that the mig - 14 promoter is activated in minimal - medium containing limiting concentrations of magnesium , low pH , or antimicrobial cationic peptides .
The mig - 14 promoter is upregulated in response to PB in a phoP - independent manner , suggesting the existence of additional regulators of mig - 14 .
The mig - 14 strain shows increased sensitivity to the antimicrobial peptides PB and protegrin - 1 ( PG - 1 ) , indicating that regulation of mig - 14 by these peptides is functionally important .
Analysis of mig - 14 lipid - A by matrix - assisted laser desorption ionization -- time of flight ( MALDI - TOF ) and crude LPS preparations by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) showed no differences from the isogenic wild - type strain .
Therefore , the mechanism by which Mig - 14 contributes to antimicrobial peptide resistance remains to be elucidated .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Media and culture conditions .
Bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C with aeration in the N minimal - medium of Nelson and Kennedy containing 10 mM MgCl 2 ( 32 ) with modifications as previously described ( 40 ) , except where otherwise indicated .
The pH of the medium was buffered with either 100 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7.4 , or 10 mM methyl - ethyl sulfanilamide , pH - 5.8 .
All marked mutations were moved into the SL1344 background by transduction with P22HT by standard methods ( 27 ) .

This assay was performed essentially as previously described ( 11 ) .
Briefly , bacterial strains were inoculated into modified N minimal medium at pH 7.4 containing 10 mM MgCl 2 .
Stationary - phase cultures were harvested and washed three times in N minimal - medium , pH 7.4 , without MgCl 2 .

Lipid A was purified by hydrolysis in 1 % SDS at pH 4.5 ( 3 ) .
Before being applied on a sample plate , the lyophilized lipid A was dissolved in 5 l of 5 - chloro - 2-mercaptobenzothiazole MALDI matrix in chloroform - methanol ( 1:1 ) .
Negative - ion MALDI - TOF was performed as described previously ( 6 ) .
Construction of pmrD reporter plasmids .
The promoter regions of pmrD ( 290 bases upstream of the start ATG ) and pmrC ( 208 bases upstream of the start ATG ) were amplified in a Stratagene RoboCycler with PCRSupermix ( Gibco BRL ) and standard PCR conditions .
The primers used for pmrD were pmrD5 , GCGAATTCAGTTTGGTC - ATCGTCCCGTTG , and pmrD3 , GCGGATC CGTTTCACGCTGATTGTTCATAAC .
The primers used for pmrC were pmrC5 , GCGAATTCTCGAATTCGATCACCGCGCTG , and pmrC3 , GCGG ATCCGACTTCGGTGACGCTAATCGTG .
The PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI - BamHI sites of the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) reporter plasmid pFPV25 ( 52 ) to generate ppmrD : : GFP and ppmrC : : GFP .
Fluorescence - activated cell sorter - based analysis of promoter activity .
Bacterial strains harboring reporter constructs were grown overnight in N minimal medium , pH 7.4 , plus 10 mM MgCl 2 , harvested , washed in N minimal - medium , pH 7.4 , without MgCl 2 , and diluted 1:100 into minimal - medium , pH 7.4 , plus 10 mM MgCl 2 .
Mid - log - phase bacteria ( optical density at 600 nm , 0.5 to 0.6 ) were then inoculated into the indicated media and grown for 3htoallow expression of GFP .

In order to increase our understanding of mig - 14 regulation and investigate the role of mig - 14 in virulence , we used a mig - 14 : : GFP transcriptional reporter fusion to determine the conditions necessary for induction or repression of mig - 14 .
Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that mig - 14 expression in macrophages requires the two - component regulatory system PhoP - PhoQ ( 53 ) .
Since this system is activated by low Mg 2 concentrations ( 10 ) , we first examined expression of mig - 14 in medium containing limiting concentrations of Mg 2 .
For comparison to other PhoP - regulated genes involved in antimicro - VOL .

The light histograms represent bacteria grown in N minimal - medium , pH 7.4 , and 10 mM MgCl 2 ; the bold histograms represent bacteria grown in identical N minimal - medium with additions or modifications as indicated .
The activity of all three promoters is significantly induced by low Mg 2 and by antimicrobial peptides .
( A ) Induction by low Mg , low pH , and cationic antimicrobial peptides .
( B ) Induction by membrane - active detergents .
bial peptide resistance , we made reporter fusions to the pmrC and pmrD promoters .
pmrD is activated by PhoP , and the PmrD protein is thought to posttranscriptionally regulate the activity of PmrA ( 26 ) .
pmrC is the first gene of the pmrCAB operon and is cotranscribed with pmrAB ( 14 ) .
The pmrC promoter has been shown to be regulated by both PhoP and PmrA ( 14 , 55 ) .
Therefore , the transcriptional activity of pmrD should be PhoP dependent but PmrA independent , whereas the activity of pmrC should be both PhoP and PmrA dependent .
Transcription from the mig - 14 promoter was induced approximately 10 - fold more in 10 M MgCl 2 than in 10 mM MgCl 2 ( Fig. 1A and Table 2 ) .
The pmrC and pmrD promoters were similarly induced in this low - magnesium medium .
These data indicate that , like other PhoP - activated genes , mig - 14 is 3206 BRODSKY ET AL. .

induced by low concentrations of Mg 2 .
Also like other PhoPactivated genes , mig - 14 promoter activity was constitutively induced to high levels in a strain containing constitutively activated PhoP even in medium with 10 mM MgCl 2 ( data not shown ) .
Because mig - 14 is induced in the macrophage phagosome , we asked whether low pH would also induce mig - 14 transcription .
Indeed , we observed that low pH in the absence of low Mg 2 could induce mig - 14 expression , albeit at lower levels than medium containing low Mg 2 alone ( Table 2 ) .
There was no synergistic effect between magnesium and pH , as pH - 5.8 medium also containing low Mg 2 did not show a greater fold induction of mig - 14 than the low Mg 2 medium alone ( data not shown ) .
mig - 14 is induced by antimicrobial peptides .
Recent work has demonstrated that PhoP activates a number of genes , including the two - component response regulator encoded by pmrA , that are important in Salmonella resistance to PB and some mammalian antimicrobial peptides ( 13 ) .
It is likely that Salmonella encounters antimicrobial peptides within host microenvironments during in - vivo infection .
These peptides may contribute to environmental signals that trigger changes in bacterial gene expression .
We therefore examined the cationic peptides PB , protamine , and PG - 1 to determine whether any or all of these could stimulate mig - 14 gene expression .
Protamine is a polycationic molecule present in sperm nuclei , and PG - 1 is a mammalian antimicrobial peptide originally isolated from porcine leukocytes ( 25 ) .
In all cases , we observed that expression of GFP from the mig - 14 reporter fusion was significantly higher in medium containing antimicrobial peptide than in medium without peptide .
Similarly , the pmrC and pmrD reporters were also induced in media containing these antimicrobial peptides ( Fig. 1A and Table 2 ) .
PB induced the greatest level of expression in all cases , with the pmrC promoter exhibiting the highest overall levels of induction .
Expression of the phoP - independent gene rpsM was unaltered in all of the above conditions , demonstrating that these conditions specifically induce the expression of genes that are PhoP regulated ( data not shown ) .
Exposure of bacteria to high concentrations of cationic peptides in most cases results in membrane damage and bacterial death .
We therefore examined the membrane - active detergents Triton X - 100 and SDS to determine whether exposure to membrane - damaging agents per se would induce expression of the mig - 14 and pmr GFP reporters .
In contrast to both pmrC and pmrD , mig - 14 was only slightly induced by these detergents ( Fig. 1B and Table 2 ) .
Interestingly , pmrC was markedly induced in the presence of SDS .
phoP was required for the induction of these reporters in Triton X - 100 and SDS , as this activation was not observed in the phoP : : Tn10 mutant ( Fig .
184 , 2002 mig - 14 IN SALMONELLA ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE RESISTANCE 3207 FIG. 2 .
The phoP : : Tn10 strain was used for the analysis described in the legend to Fig. 1 .
phoP is required for activation of all promoters by all conditions except for that of pmrC by low pH and mig - 14 and pmrD by PB .
However , we found that induction of the reporter fusions by these detergents was only observed in log - phase - grown bacteria .
The nondetergent conditions induced expression of all three reporters regardless of the growth phase ( data not shown ) .
This is consistent with previous results that PhoPregulated genes do not play a role in resistance to killing by Triton X - 100 or SDS ( 54 ) .
These data suggest that in addition to pmrA , pmrD , and other PhoP - regulated genes , mig - 14 may play a role in adaptive responses to membrane perturbations caused specifically by antimicrobial peptides .
PB induces mig - 14 in a phoP - independent manner .
phoP was previously shown to be required for the induction of mig - 14 in macrophages .
We therefore asked whether phoP was also required for the induction of mig - 14 in response to these in - vitro conditions .
As expected , we found that in a phoP : : Tn10 strain background , expression of all three PhoP - regulated genes was 3208 BRODSKY ET AL. .
The pmrA : : Kan strain was used for the analysis described in the legend to Fig. 1 .
pmrA is required for the activation of the pmrC promoter but not of the pmrD or mig - 14 promoters .
reduced compared to that of the wild type ( compare Fig. 1A and 2A ; Table 2 ) .
We also found that phoP was required for induction of all three reporter constructs in low Mg 2 , protamine , and PG - 1 .
pmrC was still induced by low pH in a phoP : : Tn10 background , consistent with previous results that the PmrA - PmrB system responds to low pH independently of PhoP - PhoQ ( 42 ) .
We also found that in contrast to the other antimicrobial peptides , PB induced expression of both mig - 14 and pmrD reporter constructs even in the phoP : : Tn10 background , although absolute levels of induction were lower than in the isogenic wild type ( Fig. 2A and Table 2 ) .
This suggests that an additional system regulates gene expression in response to PB and possibly other antimicrobial peptides .
pmrA is not required for regulation of mig - 14 .
It has been demonstrated that a subset of PhoP - regulated genes is directly controlled by an alternate two - component regulatory system encoded by pmrAB .
We therefore examined the transcriptional responses of the mig - 14 , pmrC , and pmrD reporter fusions in a VOL .

Survival of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains after a 1 - h PB challenge .
Bacterial strains were exposed to 2.5 g of PB/ml in LB for 1 h after being grown in the following N minimal media : 10 M MgCl 2 , pH - 5.8 ( dark grey bars ) ; 10 mM MgCl 2 , pH - 5.8 ( white bars ) ; 10 M MgCl 2 , pH 7.4 ( lined bars ) ; and 10 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7.4 ( light grey bars ) .
WT refers to the SL1344 strain .
Data are expressed relative to the input bacterial CFU .
For ease of analysis , Mg 2 and pH conditions are indicated below the corresponding bars .
For Mg 2 , a plus sign refers to 10 mM and a minus sign refers to 10 M MgCl 2 .
For pH , a plus sign indicates pH 7.4 and a minus sign indicates pH - 5.8 .
The mig - 14 : : Kan strain is 10 - to 20 - fold more sensitive to polymyxin than the corresponding wild - type strain .
The survival of the phoP : : Tn10 strain was less than 1 % for all conditions .
Experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate , and the data presented are from a representative experiment .
pmrA : : Kan strain background .
We found that induction of mig - 14 and pmrD still occurred , in contrast to the pmrC reporter , which was no longer induced under any of the conditions tested ( Fig. 3A ) .
PmrB has been shown to sense both iron and pH , and it activates PmrA in response to high iron ( 56 ) .
We did not see induction of mig - 14 in the presence of iron , confirming that mig - 14 is not regulated directly by PmrA - PmrB ( data not shown ) .
However , in the case of the mig - 14 reporter , expression levels in low Mg 2 and PB were significantly higher in the pmrA : : Kan strain than in the wild type ( Table 2 ) .
Furthermore , uninduced levels of pmrD were approximately twofold higher than in the wild - type strain .
These data suggest that although pmrA is not required for induction of mig - 14 or pmrD , it may be involved in feedback regulation .
mig - 14 is necessary for inducible polymyxin resistance .
We next investigated the functional significance of the ability of antimicrobial peptides to induce mig - 14 promoter activity by examining the resistance of the mig - 14 : : Kan strain to PB .
Figure 4 shows survival data for Salmonella strains grown in various conditions followed by a 1 - h exposure to 2.5 g of PB/ml .
Consistent with previously reported results , we observed that the wild - type strain , SL1344 , was resistant to PB after growth in medium containing low concentrations ( 10 M ) of Mg 2 .
The mig - 14 : : Kan mutant was approximately 5 - fold more sensitive to PB in low - pH medium containing low Mg 2 and approximately 20 - fold more sensitive in low - Mg 2 medium alone than the wild - type strain .
As expected , the isogenic phoP : : Tn10 strain was completely susceptible to PB challenge following growth in all of the conditions tested .
Nearly 100 % of the phoP : : Tn10 strains were killed within the first 15 min of PB challenge ( data not shown ) .
mig - 14 : : Kan sensitivity to polymyxin is complemented by overexpression of PmrD .
Previous work has shown that overexpression of pmrD confers increased resistance to PB ( 37 ) .
This has been hypothesized to be due to increased expression of genes regulated by PmrA , which is positively regulated by PmrD ( 26 ) .
We transformed SL1344 , mig - 14 : : Kan , and pmrA : : Kan strains with a plasmid , pKR301 , that expresses pmrD from its native promoter to determine whether pmrD overexpression could restore wild - type levels of PB resistance to the mig - 14 and pmrA strains .
Overexpression of pmrD did indeed restore nearly wild - type levels of resistance to the mig - 14 : : Kan mutant strain ( Fig. 5 ) .
This effect was not due to nonspecific activity of the plasmid , since overexpression of pmrD failed to complement the pmrA : : Kan strain , and the parent plasmid pHSG576 also did not confer increased PB resistance .
The ability of pmrD overexpression to complement the PB sensitivity of the mig - 14 strain suggests that mig - 14 could participate in modification of LPS along with other genes regulated by PhoP - PhoQ and PmrA - PmrB .
Alternatively , the complementation could be due to overexpression of genes regulated by PmrD and PmrA - PmrB which can bypass the defect in the mig - 14 strain .
In addition to restoring PB resistance with pmrD , we could also partially restore PB resistance to the mig - 14 strain with a mig - 14 - expressing plasmid ( data not shown ) .
This plasmid had been previously used to complement the mig - 14 mutant for virulence in oral infection of mice ( 51 ) .
mig - 14 is not required for addition of 4 - aminoarabinose to LPS .
A major mechanism of resistance to PB that is controlled by the PmrA - PmrB system is the addition of 4 - aminoarabinose to the 4 phosphate group of lipid - A ( 13 , 20 ) , though some evidence suggests that PB resistance can be restored to a sensitive mutant even in the absence of 4 - aminoarabinose ( 13 ) .
To examine if Mig - 14 participates in the addition of 4 - aminoarabinose to lipid - A , we analyzed lipid - A of wild - type and mig - 14 mutant strains by MALDI - TOF mass spectrometry as de - FIG. 5 .
Survival of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains overexpressing pmrD after a 1 - h PB challenge .
Data are expressed relative to identical strains grown without PB for 1 h. Dark grey bars , 10 M MgCl 2 , pH - 5.8 ; white bars , 10 mM MgCl 2 , pH - 5.8 ; lined bars , 10 M MgCl 2 , pH 7.4 ; light grey bars , 10 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7.4 .
Bacterial strains harboring the pmrD - expressing plasmid pKR301 were treated as described in Materials and Methods .
Overexpression of pmrD restored PB resistance to the mig - 14 : : Kan strain but not to the pmrA : : Kan mutant .
We next examined the global LPS profiles of the mig - 14 : : Kan mutant by SDS - PAGE of crude bacterial preparations from wild - type , mig - 14 , phoP , and galE strains as described by Tsai and Frasch ( 48 ) .
Once again , no detectable differences in the LPS profiles of the wild - type and mig - 14 strains were observed ( data not shown ) .
It is possible that there are other differences in the LPS structure or differences in the expression of outer membrane proteins that could account for the observed sensitivity of the mig - 14 : : Kan strain to PB .
mig - 14 is necessary for resistance to mammalian peptide PG - 1 .
Sensitivity of Salmonella to PB has been shown to correlate with sensitivity to mammalian antimicrobial peptides .
This finding has significant consequences for the infection process of this pathogen , as it encounters various antimicrobial peptides throughout the process of colonization within its host .
It was recently demonstrated that strains of Proteus mirabilis selected for PB sensitivity also had increased sensitivity to PG - 1 as well as defects in LPS structure ( 28 ) .
We therefore examined the sensitivity of wild - type , mig - 14 : : Kan , and phoP : : Tn10 strains to a panel of PG - 1 concentrations .
We observed a marked loss of resistance to PG - 1 in the phoP mutant strain and saw intermediate levels of sensitivity to PG - 1 in the mig - 14 mutant ( Fig. 7 ) .
While not as dramatic as that of the phoP strain , the sensitivity of the mig - 14 mutant was nonetheless significantly lower than that of the isogenic wild - type strain , even at the lowest peptide concentration examined .
The results were similar whether bacteria were grown in low Mg 2 alone or both in low Mg 2 and at low pH ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that mig - 14 is regulated by antimicrobial peptides and low - Mg 2 conditions that are likely to be present in some host microenvironments , and they suggest a functional link between this regulation and a role for mig - 14 in resistance of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium to antimicrobial peptides .
MALDI - TOF mass spectra of purified lipid - A from wildtype ( SL1344 ) and mig - 14 : : Kan ( mig14 ) strains .
Strains were grown in N minimal - medium containing either 1 mM ( A and C ) or 8 M ( Band D ) MgCl 2 .
The growth of both strains in 1 mM MgCl 2 shows the expected peaks at an m/z of 2,036 ( hepta - acylated wild - type LPS ) and at an m/z of 1,797 ( hexa - acylated LPS lacking palmitate ) .
Analysis of LPS from the wild - type and mig - 14 : : Kan strains grown in 8 M MgCl 2 yielded peaks at m/z of 2,183 and 1,929 , which is consistent with the presence of hepta - and hexa - acylated forms of LPS containing the 4 - aminoarabinose modification ( B and D ) .
scribed in Materials and Methods .
Lipid A was isolated from wild - type and isogenic mig - 14 : : Kan strains after growth in N minimal - medium containing 1 mM or 8 M MgCl 2 .
Asexpected , neither SL1344 nor mig - 14 : : Kan strains grown in 1 mM MgCl 2 contained detectable amounts of 4 - aminoarabinosemodified LPS ( Fig. 6A and C ) .
However , when grown in limiting Mg 2 conditions , both strains synthesized 4 - aminoarabinose lipid - A as indicated by the presence of peaks at m/z of 1,945 and 2,183 ( Fig. 6B and D ) .
These data suggest that the increased sensitivity of the mig - 14 : : Kan strain to PB is not due to a defect in 4 - aminoarabinose modification of lipid - A .
Because MALDI - TOF ( mass spectrometry ) analysis is not quantitative , it is formally possible that there may be an overall reduction in the amount of 4 - aminoarabinose containing lipid A in the outer membrane of the mig - 14 : : Kan mutant strain .
Sensitivity of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains to PG - 1 .
Wild - type ( -RCB- ) , mig - 14 : : Kan ( ■ ) , and phoP : : Tn10 ( Œ ) strains were grown overnight as described , washed , diluted in N minimal medium , pH 7.4 , and 10 M MgCl 2 , and grown for 3 h prior to being inoculated into LB containing the indicated concentrations of PG - 1 .
The experiment was performed 3 times in triplicate , and the data shown are from a representative experiment .
Data are expressed relative to bacteria treated without PG - 1 .
mig - 14 : : Kan is markedly attenuated in its ability to survive PG - 1 treatment compared to the wild type , although not as drastically as phoP : : Tn10 .
184 , 2002 mig - 14 IN SALMONELLA ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDE RESISTANCE 3211 DISCUSSION mig - 14 is a PhoP - activated gene of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium required for virulence in orally infected mice ( 51 ) .
It is induced within the macrophage vacuole in a phoP - dependent manner but is not required for bacterial survival and replication within macrophages in tissue culture ( 53 ) .
To better understand the role of mig - 14 in Salmonella pathogenesis , we have characterized the regulation of mig - 14 in a variety of in vitro conditions .
mig - 14 expression , as measured by mig - 14 : : GFP reporter activity , was most strongly upregulated in medium containing low Mg 2 and cationic antimicrobial peptides such as PB , protamine , and PG - 1 .
It is interesting that protamine as well as PB and PG - 1 induced the expression of the reporter constructs , as it has been suggested that the antimicrobial action of protamine is mechanistically different than the membrane permeabilizing activity of PB and PG - 1 ( 1 ) .
The upregulation of mig - 14 : : GFP and pmrD : : GFP by PB showed a phoP - independent component as induction occurred even in the absence of an intact PhoP - PhoQ system .
This observation suggests that other regulatory systems may activate mig - 14 , and perhaps other antimicrobial peptide resistance genes , directly in response to the presence of antimicrobial peptides .
We further demonstrate that in addition to being induced by antimicrobial peptides , mig - 14 is also required for bacterial resistance to killing by PB and PG - 1 .
The results of our PB resistance assays indicated that growth of bacteria in low Mg 2 was the strongest signal to induce PB - resistant adaptations , as we did not see significant resistance in bacteria grown at pH - 5.8 in high Mg 2 ( Fig. 4 ) .
This is in contrast to the results of Groisman et al. ( 11 ) , who observed significant levels of resistance in pH - 5.8 medium alone .
The reasons for these differences are not fully understood , but one possible explanation is that there are subtle strain - specific differences in response to low - pH conditions .
It is possible that these conditions did not produce optimal induction of the pH - responsive PmrA - PmrB system in our strain , resulting in reduced resistance .
This is supported by the regulation studies , where we observed significantly higher levels of induction by Mg 2 than by low pH , even of the pmrC : : GFP reporter , suggesting that we may not have achieved maximal induction of the pmrAB regulon .
In the complementation experiments overexpressing pmrD , we did in fact observe significant levels of resistance in pH - 5.8 medium alone .
Regardless of the reasons for this subtle difference , the mig - 14 : : Kan strain showed attenuated resistance to antimicrobial peptides in comparison to the wild type in all of our assays .
Together , our data suggest that mig - 14 participates with other PhoP - regulated genes in the adaptive responses of Salmonella to environmental conditions that include magnesium depletion and damage by cationic peptides .
PhoP and PhoQ comprise a two - component system that regulates a large number of genes in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in response to a variety of nutrient - starvation conditions ( 24 ) .
It has been appreciated for a number of years that the phoPQ regulon is necessary for Salmonella replication in macrophages and virulence in mouse models of infection ( 8 , 29 ) .
Investigators also demonstrated that phoP - null mutants were attenuated in resistance to a number of antimicrobial peptides ( 7 , 31 ) .
More recently , it has become clear that one of the functions of PhoP - regulated genes is to remodel the bacterial envelope in response to changing environmental conditions .
This remodeling occurs both at the level of outer membrane protein expression ( 12 , 30 ) and at the level of structural modifications of LPS ( 16 ) .
Both phoP mutants that are fixed in the constitutively active state and phoP - null mutants are unable to remodel the outer membrane in response to environmental signals and are avirulent in animal infections ( 30 ) , suggesting that this remodeling is crucial for survival within the host environment .
A consensus PhoP binding site has been identified in E. coli by using the promoters of the genes mgtA and mgrB ( 23 ) .
We were not able to identify this consensus sequence in the promoter region of mig - 14 , suggesting that PhoP could regulate mig - 14 indirectly .
A number of PhoP - regulated genes , several of which are regulated indirectly through a second two - component system , PmrA - PmrB ( 14 , 42 ) also lack this consensus sequence ( 41 ) .
PhoP activates PmrA via PmrD , which is thought to posttranscriptionally activate PmrA ( 26 ) .
Our results indicated that mig - 14 is not regulated by PmrA - PmrB ( Fig. 3 ) .
This suggests either that PhoP directly regulates mig - 14 and binds to the mig - 14 promoter at an uncharacterized binding site or that mig - 14 may be regulated by as - yet - unidentified upstream regulatory genes .
The induction of mig - 14 by PB in a phoP background indicates that it is likely that there are other regulators of mig - 14 .
The PhoP - PhoQ and PmrA - PmrB regulatory systems participate in activating the transcription of gene products that generate several different modified forms of LPS .
Substitution of lipid - A with 4 - aminoarabinose at one of the two phosphate groups is directly controlled by PmrA - PmrB and is an important mechanism of resistance to PB and several other antimicrobial peptides .
Our data indicate that mig - 14 is not required for the addition of 4 - aminoarabinose to lipid - A .
Furthermore , we observed no changes in global LPS profiles of mig - 14 bacteria by SDS - PAGE and silver staining ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that another mechanism is responsible for the contribution of the Mig - 14 protein to antimicrobial resistance .
Mig - 14 could be involved in the addition of ethanolamine to the LPS core , which has also been shown to correlate with polymyxin resistance ( 20 , 50 ) .
However , as ethanolamine addition takes place in E. coli K - 12 ( 33 , 57 ) , which does not possess mig - 14 ( 51 ) , it is at least the case that ethanolamine addition can take place in the absence of mig - 14 function .
While mig - 14 is not necessary for colonization of the Peyer 's patches , it plays a role in colonization of the spleen and liver following oral inoculation in a mouse model of typhoid ( 51 ) .
This observation and our results that mig - 14 strains are more sensitive to antimicrobial peptides are consistent with the findings of Gunn et al. , who demonstrate that certain polymyxinsensitive mutants of Salmonella were strongly out - competed in replication by the wild - type strain in the liver and spleen following oral infection ( 15 ) .
The reduced virulence of the mig - 14 : : Kan mutant is therefore consistent with the idea that the Mig - 14 protein is necessary for resistance to killing by antimicrobial peptides within the host environment and contributes to Salmonella survival during in - vivo infection .
The sensitivity of the mig - 14 strain to antimicrobial peptides could 3212 BRODSKY ET AL. .
account for the attenuation of its virulence in mice following oral infection .
The precise role of Mig - 14 in conferring protection from antimicrobial peptides is as yet unknown .
However , our data suggest that mig - 14 is likely to contribute to antimicrobial peptide resistance via a mechanism other than direct modification of LPS .
A sequence present in Mig - 14 shares homology with the helix - loop - helix motif of the AraC family of transcriptional regulatory proteins , suggesting that it could be a regulatory protein .
Interestingly , a large number of AraC family members are involved in antibiotic resistance , stress response , and carbohydrate metabolism ( 9 ) .
We are pursuing further studies to establish the precise function of the Mig - 14 protein and determine the mechanism by which it contributes to antimicrobial peptide resistance .
