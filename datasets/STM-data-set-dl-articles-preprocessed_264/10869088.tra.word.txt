YI , 2 HOULE WANG , 2 † MURRAY HACKETT , 2 AND SAMUEL I. MILLER 1,3 * Departments of Microbiology , 1 Medicine , 3 and Medicinal Chemistry , 2 University of Washington , Seattle , Washington 98195 The outer membrane protein contents of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains with PhoP/PhoQ regulon mutations were compared by two - dimensional gel electrophoresis .
At least 26 species of outer membrane proteins ( OMPs ) were identified as being regulated by PhoP/PhoQ activation .
One PhoP/PhoQ - activated OMP was identified by semiautomated tandem mass spectrometry coupled with electronic database searching as PgtE , a member of the Escherichia coli OmpT and Yersinia pestis Pla family of outer membrane proteases .
Salmonella PgtE expression promoted resistance to alpha - helical cationic antimicrobial peptides ( - CAMPs ) .
Strains expressing PgtE cleaved C18G , an 18 - residue - CAMP present in culture medium , indicating that protease activity is likely to be the mechanism of OmpT - mediated resistance to - CAMPs .
PhoP/PhoQ did not regulate the transcription or export of PgtE , indicating that another PhoP/PhoQ - dependent mechanism is required for PgtE outer membrane localization .
PgtE is a posttranscriptionally regulated component of the PhoP/PhoQ regulon that contributes to Salmonella resistance to innate immunity .
Innate immunity is a mechanism by which animals sense and control invading microbes , including bacteria .
Cationic antimicrobial peptides ( CAMPs ) are a major component of innate immunity ( 55 ) .
CAMPs are released at mucosal and skin surfaces and are part of the phagocytic vacuole microbicidal mechanism .
CAMPs have a variety of amphipathic structures that function to kill bacteria by permeabilization of lipid bilayers .
Upon host colonization , gram - negative bacteria can increase their resistance to innate host defenses , including CAMPs , by changing the structure , immunogenic properties , and permeability of their surfaces .
The PhoP/PhoQ regulatory system of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a host defense mechanism by which bacteria respond to environmental signals and induce changes in the bacterial outer membrane that promote CAMP resistance ( 20 ) .
These changes include addition of aminoarabinose and palmitate to the lipid - A moiety of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( 16 , 19 , 21 ) , which promotes resistance to polymyxin ( 15 , 19 ) , alpha - helical antimicrobial peptides , and protegrin , a - sheet antimicrobial peptide ( 21 ) .
Besides regulating the expression of enzymes involved in LPS modifications , PhoP/PhoQ regulates the expression of several secreted and membrane proteins ( 4 , 44 ) that could be important for resistance to bactericidal agents .
To identify additional members of the PhoP/PhoQ regulon that are involved in resistance to CAMPs , outer membrane protein ( OMP ) profiles of Salmonella strains with phoP/phoQ mutations were compared .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth - conditions .
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1 .
Bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C with University of Washington , HSB K - 140 , Box 357710 , Seattle , WA 98195 .
† Present address : Bruker Daltonics , Billerica , MA 01821 .
aeration in Luria broth ( LB ) ( 31 ) , tryptic soy broth ( Difco ) , Mueller - Hinton broth ( Difco ) , or N minimal - medium supplemented with 0.1 % casamino - acids , 38 mM glycerol , and 8 M MgCl 2 ( 13 ) .
Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations : kanamycin , 45 g/ml ; ampicillin , 50 to 100 g/ml ; and streptomycin , 1,000 g/ml .
Cloning of pgtE and construction of mutant strains .
DNA sequences flanking pgtE were amplified by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotide primers and cloned into the XbaI and HindIII sites of pBluescript KS .
The resulting plasmid contained DNA sequences deleted for most of the pgtE open reading frame ( nucleotides 3912 to 4785 and 5594 to 5916 ; GenBank accession no .
A kanamycin resistance cassette was then inserted into the EcoRI site within pgtE .
The pgtE : : Kan cassette was then cloned into the pKAS32 suicide vector ( 41 ) digested with KpnI and SacI ( pTG51 ) , and SM10 pir cells were transformed .
Allelic exchange was performed by a conjugative transfer of pTG51 into CS401 , a wild - type strain of serovar Typhimurium containing a recessive streptomycin sensitivity allele .
Single homologous recombination derivatives were isolated by selection for ampicillin and kanamycin resistance and then selected on streptomycin for loss of plasmid sequences .
The presence of the pgtE : : Kan cassette on the chromosome was determined by PCR amplification .
The mutated locus was transferred into other Salmonella strains by P22HTint phage - mediated transduction .
Isolation of bacterial outer membranes and analysis of OMPs by 2 - D PAGE .
Outer membranes were isolated by a modified protocol of Osborn et al. ( 36 ) .
One liter of LB - medium was inoculated from an overnight culture at a dilution factor of 1:100 .
Cultures were grown until late log phase ( optical density at 600 nm [ OD 600 ] 0.8 to 1.0 ) , when cells were collected by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C .
Bacterial spheroplasts were generated by cold osmotic shock in 0.5 M sucrose -- 10 mM Tris - Cl ( pH 7.8 ) -- 60 g of lysozyme per ml and subsequent addition of an equal volume of ice - cold 1 M EDTA .
Spheroplasts were broken by French press at 16,000 lb/in 2 , unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 6,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C , and the bacterial extract was separated into fractions by centrifugation at 200,000 g for1hat4 °C .
The pellet fraction containing total bacterial membranes was homogenized in 20 % sucrose and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation at 180,000 g for 12 to 16 h at 4 °C .
The outer membrane fraction was separated as the band of highest buoyant density in the sucrose gradient .
For more efficient separation during isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) , aliquots containing 250 g of total OMP were washed in deionized water and solubilized by boiling for 10 minutes in 1 % ( wt/vol ) sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) .
Protein was subsequently precipitated in 10 volumes of ice - cold acetone .
Removal of the bulk of the outer membrane lipid and LPS aggregates by this technique significantly improved protein separation by IEF .
The protein precipitate was resuspended in solubilization buffer containing 9 M urea , 2 % Triton X - 100 , 2 % Pharmalyte pH 3 - 10 ( Pharmacia ) , 2 % - mercaptoethanol , and the protease - inhibitors pepstatin ( 2 g/ml ) , aprotinin ( 2 g/ml ) , and leupeptin ( 2 g/ml ) .
After 2hofincubation at 37 °C , insoluble material was removed by sedimentation at 14,000 g for 10 min at room temperature .
Solubilized protein was first separated by IEF using a Pharmacia Multiphor II electrophoresis unit with immobilized pH gradients ( pH 4077 4078 GUINA ET AL. .

4 to 7 ) and then on SDS -- 12 % polyacrylamide gels .
Protein spots were visualized by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue .
Gels were scanned using an UMAX Astra 1200S scanner , and two - dimensional ( 2 - D ) profiles of outer membrane proteomes were compared .
Peptide isolation , sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry , and identification of PgtE .
Protein spots of interest were excised from Coomassie - stained 2 - D SDS - polyacrylamide gels and digested in situ with trypsin as described below ( obtained as a personal communication from Michael Kinter , University of Virginia ) .
Polyacrylamide gel slices were fragmented , destained during an overnight incubation in 50 % ( vol/vol ) methanol , and dehydrated by incubation in acetonitrile for 10 min .
Excess liquid was removed under vacuum , and gel fragments were rehydrated in 50 l of sequencing - grade modified trypsin ( Promega ) at the concentration of 20 g/ml .
After a 30 - min incubation on ice , excess trypsin was removed , 20 l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added , and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C .
Resulting peptides were eluted from the gel with several changes of extraction buffer ( 200 l of 50 % acetonitrile -- 5 % formic acid ) and dried by evaporation .
Peptides were solubilized in 5 % acetonitrile -- 0.5 % acetic acid for further analysis .
LC/MS/MS analysis ( liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry ) of tryptic peptides was carried out with a Finnigan/Thermoquest TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ( San Jose , Calif. ) , coupled with a microcapillary high - pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) apparatus built inhouse .
The details of our modifications of a Shimadzu HPLC system ( Shimadzu Scientific Instruments , Inc. , Columbia , Md. ) for use with capillary HPLC have been described previously ( 50 ) .
The Finnigan API ( atmospheric pressure ionization ) electrospray source was modified with a capacitive sprayer assembly ( 49 ) .
A linear binary gradient of solvents at a flow rate of 200 ml/min ( Shimadzu LC - 10AD pumps ) was split precolumn to give a 1:1,000 split ratio , as measured at the beginning of the gradient .
A fused - silica capillary column was packed in - house , 75 m inner diameter by 12 cm ( Magic C18 ; 5 - m packing ; 100 Å pore size ; Michrom Bioresources , Auburn , Calif. ) , and connected to the splitter .
The column was eluted with a gradient of 0 to 75 % acetonitrile in the presence of 0.4 % acetic acid over 25 min .
The temperature of the heated capillary inlet to the mass spectrometer was set at 180 °C .
When the main beam ion peaks for a peptide reached a preset threshold ( 40,000 counts ) , the ion of interest was automatically selected for collision - induced dissociation ( CID ) using the datadependent scanning capabilities built into the TSQ , which are accessed using ICL ( instrument control language ) procedures ( 11 ) .
Protein identification was accomplished by use of the SEQUEST computer program ( 53 ) .
Bacterial sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides .
Standard MICs of CAMPs were determined as described ( 45 ) , except that bacterial cultures were grown overnight in N minimal - medium with low ( 8 M ) magnesium or in tryptic soy broth and diluted to 2 10 5 bacteria per ml in N minimal - medium with low magnesium .
Complementation experiments were performed in Mueller - Hinton broth .
Test peptides were assayed at final concentrations of 0.15 to 40.0 g/ml in 96 - well polypropylene microtiter plates ( Costar ) .
The MIC was determined as the lowest concentration of the peptide that did not allow visible bacterial growth after 24 h ( for assays performed in rich - medium ) or after 48 h ( for assays that were performed in minimal - medium ) .

Unlabeled arrowheads point to protein species present exclusively in the absence ( PhoP null ) or presence ( PhoP constitutive ) of an active PhoP/PhoQ regulatory system .
PgtE is a protein that was sequenced and analyzed in this study .
diffusion assays as described previously ( 23 ) .
Peptide - killing assays were performed with mid - log - phase bacterial cultures grown in rich - medium ( LB ) as described in Miller et al. ( 34 ) .
All experiments were performed two or three times .
To determine the specificity of the protease action in pgtE - mediated CAMP resistance , 2 10 5 bacterial cells were incubated with 2.5 g of C18G peptide per ml for 16 h in 0.5 % tryptone .
Cells were sedimented by centrifugation , and peptide - containing supernatants were collected .
Relative amounts of cleaved and uncleaved peptide were determined by separating the supernatants on a reversed - phase column ( 250 - mm by 1.00 - mm Jupiter column ; 5 - m particle size ; 300 - Å pore size ; C - 18 bonded silica ; Pharmacia , Inc. , Kalamazoo , Mich. ) used with the Shimadzu LC - 10AD VP liquid chromatography system .
A linear gradient of 5 to 95 % acetonitrile in H 2 O was applied over a period of 30 min .
The aqueous and organic buffers contained 0.1 and 0.08 % trifluoroacetic acid , respectively .
The sensitivity of the UV detector at 214 nm was set at 0.1 absorbance unit full scale .
Bacterial chromosomal DNA was isolated as previously described ( 17 ) .
Plasmid DNA was isolated using kits from Promega and Qiagen .
PCR was performed with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) and Taq DNA polymerase ( Gibco - BRL ) according to the manufacturers ' instructions .
A fusion of the pgtE promoter region to the transcriptional reporter f - luc was integrated into the chromosome of different Salmonella phoP strains using the suicide vector pGPLFRO3 ( 30 ) ( Table 1 ) .
Correct chromosomal localization of the pgtE - f-luc fusion was confirmed by Southern blotting and hybridization and also genetically by allelic replacement of a kanamycin resistance marker inserted into pgtE .
Bacteria were grown in LB - medium or in N minimal - medium containing different concentrations of Mg 2 .
Luciferase assays were performed throughout the growth curve of each strain as previously described ( 30 ) .

RESULTS PhoP/PhoQ regulates OMPs .
A variety of studies have identified PhoP/PhoQ - mediated transcriptional regulation of genes that encode predicted envelope proteins and alter outer membrane structure through LPS modifications ( 4 , 16 , 20 , 44 ) .
To further define PhoP/PhoQ - regulated changes in the protein composition of the Salmonella envelope , a method for highresolution analysis of gram - negative OMPs by 2 - D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 2 - D PAGE ) was developed .
Salmonella outer membranes were purified by separation on a sucrose gradient .
Then OMPs were separated from LPS aggregates by heating in the presence of an anionic detergent .
Next , protein separation was accomplished by IEF ( described in Materials and Methods ) .
A large number of Salmonella OMPs were detected by Coomassie staining of 2 - D polyacrylamide gels .
Twenty - six spots corresponding to OMPs that are members of the PhoP/PhoQ regulon were detected by comparing the 2 - D PAGE profiles of strains with PhoP - null and PhoP - constitutive phenotypes ( Fig. 1 and data not shown ) .
Twelve OMP spots were unique to the PhoP - null strain ( CS015 ) , and 14 spots were unique to the strain with increased PhoQ kinase activity ( PhoP constitutive , CS022 ) .
Thus , PhoP/PhoQ mediates significant alteration in the protein content of the outer membrane in addition to LPS structural changes .
Identification of PgtE protease as a PhoP - regulated OMP .
One abundant protein species of approximately 32 kDa and isoelectric point 5.2 localized to the outer membrane of strains that expressed activated PhoP/PhoQ but not to the membrane of the PhoP - null strain ( Fig. 1 ) .
To confirm that this protein was localized to the outer membrane as a result of PhoP/PhoQ activation , OMPs isolated from wild - type serovar Typhimurium grown in a PhoP - repressing ( 1 mM ) or PhoP - inducing 4080 GUINA ET AL. .

( 8 M ) concentration of Mg 2 ( 13 ) were separated by 2 - D PAGE .
A 32 - kDa protein of pI 5.2 was detected in the outer membranes of salmonellae that were grown in PhoP - activating conditions ( 8 M Mg 2 ) , but not in the outer membranes of salmonellae grown in the presence of a high concentration of Mg 2 ( data not shown ) , further indicating that this protein was regulated by PhoP/PhoQ - activating conditions and was not specific to strains with this phoQ mutation .
To begin the characterization of PhoP - regulated OMPs , this protein was excised from the polyacrylamide gel and digested in situ with trypsin , and the resulting peptide mixture was eluted from the gel .
An aliquot of this tryptic peptide mixture was analyzed by on - line microcapillary HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry ( Fig. 2 ) .
Sequences of isolated tryptic peptides were determined by semiautomated tandem mass spectrometry coupled with protein database searching .
Raw - product ion ( MS 2 or MS/MS ) data were searched using the SEQUEST computer program , which is capable of identifying peptides from protein amino - acid sequence data coded in FASTA format , such as that found in the OWL database ( 5 ) , from uninterpreted MS/MS spectra ( 53 ) .
Three peptides ( LSQLDWK , AGVTAGYQETR , and SIHPD TSVNYANEYDLN ) had high SEQUEST cross - correlation scores ( 2.96 , 3.80 , and 7.18 , respectively ) with peptides originating from PgtE , the Salmonella OmpT protease homologue ( 14 ) .
The SEQUEST search results suggested that all three peptides originated from the same protein , based on the gene sequence found in the SWISS - PROT database ( 2 ) , accession number P06185 .
Fragmentation of selected peptide ions by CID ( 24 ) resulted in sufficient partial sequence information to characterize the protein as PgtE ( Fig. 3 ) .
Salmonella pgtE was originally identified as an open reading frame located downstream of the inducible pgtBCA operon , which is involved in phosphoglycerate transport ( 54 ) .
Nucleotide sequence analysis and correction of PgtE sequence .
The genomic region of serovar Typhimurium that contains pgtE was cloned into a plasmid vector ( pTG73 , Table 1 ) , and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed and compared to sequences in GenBank and to sequences available from the Salmonella genome sequencing projects .
Plasmid - derived pgtE sequence was identical to regions of two S. enterica LT2 genomic fragments ( gnl/WUGSC 99287/stmlt2 - .
Contig1497 and gnl/WUGSC 99287/stmlt2 - A 2A .
Contig104 , respectively ) and highly similar to genomic fragments of serovars Typhi ( gnl/Sanger 601/S .
typhi Contig427 ) and Paratyphi ( gnl / WUGSC 32027/spara B SPA .0.1882 ) .
The nucleotide sequences derived from plasmid pTG73 and from the abovementioned Salmonella genome fragments contain several frameshifts within the pgtE open reading frame with respect to a previously reported pgtE sequence ( GenBank accession number M21279 ) .
The newly assigned PgtE sequence exhibits higher similarity to other OmpT - like proteases than the previously reported one ( 72 % identity and 83 % similarity to Y. pestis Pla , 46 % identity and 65 % similarity to E. coli OmpT and OmpP , and 38 % identity and 59 % similarity to Shigella flexneri SopA ) throughout the length of the protein .
Revised PgtE contains a C - terminal phenylalanine residue that is essential for outer membrane insertion of trimeric OMPs ( 46 ) .
E. coli contains two highly homologous genes encoding OmpT - like proteases : ompT on the chromosome ( 15 ) and ompP ( 25 ) on plasmid F ( 29 ) .
OmpP and OmpT have 87 % sequence identity ( 25 ) .
A pgtE - specific probe hybridized to a single Salmonella genomic fragment on a Southern blot ( data not shown ) .
PhoP/PhoQ does not regulate pgtE transcription and export into the periplasm .
Adams et al. ( 1 ) have reported the activity of a PhoP - regulated OmpT - like protease in serovar Typhimurium cellular extracts ( 1 ) .
The 2 - D PAGE analysis described in this study suggested that PhoP/PhoQ might regulate the transcription of pgtE .
Single - copy transcriptional - fusions of pgtE to the firefly luciferase ( f - luc ) gene were constructed by using the pGPLFR03 suicide vector ( Table 1 ) .
The resulting gene fusion contained f - luc inserted into the last third of the VOL .

The nomenclature used for b and y peptide fragment ions has been described by Biemann ( 4a ) .
Low - mass ions that are indicative of amino - acid composition but not sequence are described by the amino - acid single - letter code .
Expression of f - luc was measured throughout the growth curve in bacterial cultures grown in LB and in minimal - medium supplemented with a high ( PhoP - repressing ) or low ( PhoPinducing ) concentration of Mg 2 .
Surprisingly , similar levels of pgtE - f-luc expression were detected in the PhoP - null ( TG172 ) , wild - type ( TG173 ) , and PhoP - constitutive ( TG174 ) strains .
Expression of the pgtE - f-luc fusion increased steadily in all strains during logarithmic growth ( Fig. 4 ) .
These results indicated that transcription of pgtE is constitutive and it is not dependent on PhoP/PhoQ .
Therefore , localization of PgtE to the outer membrane is mediated by a PhoP/PhoQ - dependent mechanism that acts after the transcription of the pgtE gene .
To further analyze PhoP - mediated regulation , pgtE and a 904 - bp upstream region were cloned downstream of the inducible lac promoter on a low - copy - number plasmid ( pTG82 , Table 1 ) .
Random translational fusions of pgtE to the alkaline phosphatase gene ( phoA ) were generated in E. coli by utilizing transposon TnphoA/in delivered by the method of Manoil and Bailey ( 27 ) .
Plasmids containing transposon insertions in pgtE were isolated and analyzed .
Three plasmids , pTG85 , pTG86 , and pTG87 , contained exported PhoA fusions to residues 112 , 152 , and 190 of PgtE , respectively .
These plasmids were transferred to appropriate Salmonella strains , and the alkaline phosphatase activity of the fusion proteins in the presence and absence of phoP expression was measured as previously described ( 6 ) .
Rates of PgtE - PhoA synthesis and export were similar in all strains ( data not shown ) , indicating that the translation initiation and likely Sec - dependent translocation of PgtE across the inner membrane were independent of PhoP/PhoQ .
The results of this study suggested that localization at the 4082 GUINA ET AL. .
pgtE expression does not require PhoP .
The expression of pgtE was measured throughout the growth of bacterial cultures by quantitating the amount of luciferase activity produced by strains containing the pgtE - f-luc transcriptional - fusion .
Bacterial cultures were grown in rich - medium ( LB ) .

FLU , firefly luciferase light units .
outer membrane could be important for the protease activity of PgtE .
It has been demonstrated that proper folding , oligomerization , and insertion of some E. coli OMPs into the outer membrane are dependent on interaction with LPS molecules or specific LPS structures ( 9 , 10 , 40 ) .
Therefore , it is possible that PhoP/PhoQ - mediated modifications of LPS could affect the insertion and localization of some Salmonella OMPs , including PgtE .
To explore this possibility , OMPs from PhoPconstitutive Typhimurium strains containing a mutation in pagP , pagA , or both genes ( CS435 , TG200 , and CS404 , respectively ) , were analyzed by 2 - D PAGE for the presence of PgtE .
PhoP - regulated pagP and pagA mediate additions of palmitate and aminoarabinose , respectively , to Salmonella lipid - A ( 19 , 21 ) .
The absence of these two lipid - A modifications did not affect the localization of PgtE to the outer membrane , as determined by 2 - D PAGE ( data not shown ) , indicating that these modifications are not essential for localization of PgtE to the outer membrane .
PgtE promotes resistance to antimicrobial peptides .
PgtE belongs to the family of outer membrane endopeptidases ( 42 ) that specifically cleave between paired basic residues and after a basic residue that is followed by a nonpolar amino - acid ( 48 ) .
Therefore , CAMPs are potential targets of PgtE .
Recently , Stumpe et al. ( 48 ) have demonstrated that expression of OmpT increases survival of E. coli grown in the presence of protamine , a CAMP isolated from salmon sperm ( 47 ) .
To test whether PgtE plays a similar role in serovar Typhimurium , pgtE mutants were generated by allelic exchange and their ability to survive in the presence of CAMPs that contain predicted OmpT ( PgtE ) cleavage sites was determined .
The ability of pgtE strains to resist the bactericidal action of alpha - helical peptide C18G ( 8 ) was determined in a growth inhibition ( MIC ) assay .
The pgtE deletion strain TG61 showed increased sensitivity to C18G ( Table 2 ) .
The sensitivity of this mutant was increased when bacterial cultures were grown in N minimal medium prior to their incubation with C18G peptide .

Bacterial strains were grown either in N minimal - medium containing 8 M Mg 2 or in tryptic soy broth ( TSB ) prior to incubation with the peptides .
Bacterial cells were diluted in N minimal - medium when incubated with alpha - helical peptides C18G , LL - 37 , and CRAMP and in 1 % TSB in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 7.4 ) when incubated with defensin NP - 1 and protegrin PG - 1 .

High - copy expression of PgtE protease increases Salmonella survival upon exposure to C18G and LL - 37 ( strains were grown in Mueller - Hinton broth ) a MIC ( g/ml ) Strain C18G LL - 37 CS022 ( PhoP C ) 5.00 5.00 TG71 ( PhoP C pgtE vector ) 1.25 2.50 TG73 ( PhoP C pgtE pTG73 ) 40.0 40.0 a See Table 2 footnote a. viously described pagP mutant ( CS435 ) that is sensitive to alpha - helical CAMPs ( - CAMPs ) ( 21 ) had a higher survival rate than TG61 under the same assay conditions .
A strain containing mutations of pagP and pgtE ( TG66 ) showed greater sensitivity to C18G than strains containing single pagP or pgtE mutations ( Table 2 ) .
pgtE mutants also displayed increased sensitivity to human CAMP LL - 37 ( 26 ) and mouse CRAMP ( 3 ) , other naturally occurring alpha - helical CAMPs that contain predicted OmpT cleavage sites ( Table 2 ) .
To observe if the phenotype conferred by deletion of pgtE could be complemented , a high - copy - number plasmid expressing pgtE ( pTG73 ) or a control vector was introduced into mutant strain TG61 .
Bacterial cultures were grown in rich medium prior to incubation with CAMP to ensure high levels of pgtE expression .
As shown in Table 3 , high - level expression of pgtE greatly increases the survival of serovar Typhimurium in the presence of C18G compared to strain CS022 ( PhoP constitutive ) .
In a peptide - killing assay , the number of surviving CFU was determined after 2 10 5 bacteria were exposed to varied amounts of C18G for 2 h. Although the pgtE mutant ( TG61 ) did not display sensitivity to C18G under these conditions , expression of pgtE from a high - copy vector increased the resistance of serovar Typhimurium to C18G ( Fig. 5 ) .
The effect of pgtE deletion on resistance to several betasheet CAMPs was also examined by peptide - killing assays , MIC assays , and radial diffusion assays .
Strains deleted of pgtE did not exhibit increased sensitivity or resistance to HNP - 1 , NP - 1 , cryptidin - 2 , or protegrin PG - 1 under any of the conditions tested ( Table 2 and data not shown ) .
Therefore , pgtE is essential for Salmonella resistance to alpha - helical CAMPs but not to peptides of beta - sheet structure .
A pagP mutant ( CS435 ) did not exhibit sensitivity to protegrin PG - 1 in MIC assays ( Table 2 ) , although it was shown to be sensitive to PG - 1 in a peptide - killing assay ( 22 ) .
Evidence that protease activity is the mechanism of PgtEmediated CAMP resistance .
To determine if peptide cleavage promotes resistance to CAMP , Salmonella strains expressing pgtE were assayed for cleavage of C18G .
C18G is an 18 - residue CAMP ( ALYKKLLKKLLKSAKKLG ) that contains at least three putative PgtE cleavage sites .
In this experiment , supernatants of cultures grown in the presence of C18G were collected , and their contents were separated on a reversed - phase HPLC column .
C18G was completely degraded when incubated with strain TG73 , which expresses high levels of PgtE , while no peptide degradation was observed when it was incubated with the pgtE - null strain TG61 ( Fig. 6 ) .
An intermediate amount ( approximately 40 % ) of C18G was cleaved when incubated with parental strain CS022 ( PhoP constitutive ) ( data not shown ) .
These results indicated that peptide cleavage correlates with the serovar Typhimurium CAMP resistance phenotype .
DISCUSSION Previous studies have demonstrated that PhoP/PhoQ regulates the transcription of over one dozen genes encoding S. enterica envelope and secreted proteins , including ones such as PagC that were predicted to locate to the outer membrane ( 4 , 37 ) .
PhoP/PhoQ also regulates changes in structure of the lipid FIG. 5 .
High levels of pgtE expression increase Salmonella survival in the presence of C18G .
Mid - log - phase bacterial cultures were incubated with the indicated concentrations of C18G , and the number of CFU was determined .
Expression of pgtE from a high - copy plasmid ( in TG73 ) increased survival in the presence of C18G compared to the parental strain ( CS022 ) , while the strain with the pgtE deletion ( TG61 ) did not display significant sensitivity to C18G .
A pagP mutant ( CS435 ) was sensitive to C18G .
Salmonella cells expressing PgtE cleave C18G peptide present in the culture supernatants .
Culture supernatants were collected after an MIC experiment , and their contents were analyzed by reversed - phase HPLC as described in Materials and Methods .
A strain expressing pgtE from a high - copy plasmid ( TG73 ) efficiently cleaved C18G ( B ) , while a strain carrying a mutation in ompT ( TG61 ) did not cleave C18G ( C ) .
The control sample contained C18G in buffer without bacteria present ( A ) .
A component of LPS , which constitutes the outer leaflet of the Salmonella outer membrane ( 16 , 19 , 20 ) .
In recent years , analyses of proteomes by 2 - D gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry have allowed characterization of complex biological processes ( 52 ) .
In this work the technique of 2 - D proteome mapping was utilized to study PhoP/PhoQ regulation of Salmonella outer membrane proteins .
This work indicates that PhoP/PhoQ regulates a significant number of OMP species .
Fourteen species of OMPs that are positively regulated by PhoP/PhoQ were detected , and 12 species were repressed .
Therefore , it appears that in addition to alteration of LPS , a major function of PhoP/PhoQ is to regulate extensive structural changes in both the lipid and protein components of the outer membrane .
A surprising observation of this work was that PgtE is an abundant component of the outer membrane upon PhoP / PhoQ activation , even though pgtE transcription and PgtE export into the bacterial periplasm are not regulated by PhoP / PhoQ .
This finding indicates the utility of searching for posttranscriptionally regulated factors localized to the bacterial envelope .
The results of this study suggested that PgtE insertion into the outer membrane is dependent upon transcription of another PhoP/PhoQ - activated factor ( s ) .
It is possible that PhoP/PhoQ - mediated modifications of LPS could affect the insertion and localization of some OMPs .
Though localization of PgtE was not affected by mutations in pagP and pagA , which mediate some Salmonella PhoP - activated LPS modifications , other regulated LPS modifications or factors might be important for localization of PgtE .
In this study , maximal resistance to CAMPs was observed in strains expressing PgtE , indicating that PgtE is part of the resistance to innate immunity regulated by PhoP/PhoQ .
The PgtE contribution to inducible resistance was significant when bacteria were exposed to peptides with an alpha - helical structure , such as C18G and LL - 37 .
Such resistance correlated with the ability of bacteria to digest this peptide in the culture medium , indicating that PgtE cleavage of such peptides is the likely mechanism of resistance .
The sensitivity of the pgtE mutant was the most obvious in the microbroth dilution ( MIC ) assays , when the bacteria were incubated with the peptide for a longer period of time ( 24 to 48 h ) .
The rate of PgtE - mediated peptide hydrolysis is likely to be the limiting factor for the survival of the bacteria .
Expression of PgtE is likely advantageous for a small number of bacteria that survive the initial exposure to - CAMPs .
Bacteria expressing PgtE can slowly digest the remaining unbound - CAMP that was not bound to the bacterial membranes and replicate more efficiently than the bacteria lacking the protease .
In support of this , the contribution of PgtE to bacterial resistance in a peptide - killing assay was significant only in the presence of high - copy pgtE .
The PgtE protease was not demonstrated to contribute to Salmonella resistance to defensins or protegrin , CAMPs with an amphipathic beta - sheet structure stabilized through intramolecular disulfide bonds ( 35 ) .
Defensin structure could prevent access of PgtE to cleavage sites predicted by amino acid sequence of defensins .
In contrast to - CAMPs , which are produced throughout the animal kingdom , defensins have been found only in higher vertebrates , mammals ( 22 ) , and birds ( 7 ) .
Higher vertebrates might have evolved defensins as an additional component of innate immunity to combat microbial pathogens which acquired the ability to resist peptides of a less complex structure through PgtE ( OmpT ) production .
In this work , mutation of both pgtE and pagP resulted in greater - CAMP sensitivity than in strains containing a single mutation in either gene .
Though mutation of pagP has a minor effect on the beta - sheet CAMP protegrin , it also has been found to have a greater effect on antimicrobial - CAMP resistance .
pagP encodes a PhoP/PhoQ - activated acyltransferase which catalyzes the addition of palmitate to lipid - A and promotes a decrease in the permeability of the Salmonella outer membrane ( 21 ) .
The envelope - preserving function of pagP could contribute to the survival of salmonellae exposed to a variety of environmental stresses or to antimicrobial compounds and CAMPs within the intestinal lumen or phagocyte vacuoles .
The action of a surface protease such as PgtE could further protect bacteria by lowering the concentration of - CAMP to sublethal doses prior to insertion of the cationic peptide into the bacterial envelope .
Synergistic action of PgtE and PagP could significantly decrease the amount of - CAMP inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane and allow increased survival of bacteria during exposure to CAMPs .
Interestingly , the E. coli and Y. pestis homologues of PgtE have been implicated in virulence .
E. coli ompT has been associated with the ability to cause urinary tract infections ( 12 ) .
Additionally , the Y. pestis homologue Pla is essential for virulence in mice when injected subcutaneously but not intravenously ( 43 ) .
It is possible that these effects are a result of OmpT - mediated resistance to innate immunity .
