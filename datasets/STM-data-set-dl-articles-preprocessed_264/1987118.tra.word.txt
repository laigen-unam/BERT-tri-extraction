173 , No. 1 Regulation of Proline Utilization in Salmonella typhimurium : a Membrane - Associated Dehydrogenase Binds DNA In Vitro PAULA OSTROVSKY DE SPICER , KATHRYN O'BRIEN , AND STANLEY MALOY * Department of Microbiology , University of Illinois , 407 South Goodwin Avenue , Urbana , Illinois 61801 The PutA protein is a membrane - associated enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of proline to glutamate .
Genetic evidence suggests that in the absence of proline , the PutA protein also represses transcription of the put4 and putP genes .
To directly determine whether PutA protein binds to the put control region , we analyzed gel - retardation of put control region DNA by purified PutA protein in - vitro .
The put control region is 420 bp .
Purified PutA protein bound specifically to several nonoverlapping fragments of control region DNA , indicating the presence of multiple binding sites in the control region .
Electrophoretic abnormalities and behavior of circularly permuted fragments of control region DNA indicate that it contains a region of intrinsically curved DNA .
To determine whether the multiple binding sites or the DNA curvature are important in - vivo , two types of deletions were constructed : ( i ) deletions that removed sequences predicted to contribute to DNA curvature as well as potential operator sites and ( ii ) deletions that removed only potential operator sites .
Both types of deletions increased expression of the put genes but were still induced by proline , indicating that multiple cis elements are involved in repression .
These data suggest a model for put repression that invokes the formation of a complex between PutA protein molecules bound at different sites in the control region , brought into proximity by a loop of curved DNA .
Proline can be used as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen by Salmonella typhimurium .
Proline utilization requires the two divergently transcribed genes that form the put operon : the putP gene , encoding the major proline permease , and the putA gene , encoding a multifunctional protein that catalyzes the degradation of proline to glutamate ( 12 ) .
The PutA protein has two distinct enzymatic activities : proline oxidase and pyrroline - 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase ( 17 , 21 ) .
The proline oxidase reaction couples proline oxidation to the reduction of a tightly associated flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor , and reoxidation of the reduced - flavin adenine dinucleotide requires association of the enzyme with the electron transport chain in the membrane .
Thus , PutA protein must become membrane associated at this stage in proline catabolism ( 17 , 24 ) .
Expression of the put operon is induced by proline .
The phenotypes of several types of putA mutants indicate that the PutA protein is also involved in the regulation of the put operon ( 16 ) .
( i ) Mutations that disrupt the putA gene cause loss of enzymatic activity and constitutive expression of putP .
Such mutants are designated putA ( A - C - ) , where A - indicates the absence of enzymatic activity and C - indicates the absence of regulatory activity .
( ii ) There are three classes of putA missense mutants : putA ( A - C - ) , which show the same phenotype as the null mutants ; putA ( A - C + ) , which retain only the regulatory activity ; and putA ( A+C - ) , which retain only the enzymatic activity .
These three types of mutations map throughout the putA gene , indicating that both regulatory and enzymatic properties are located in a single polypeptide .
( iii ) Haploid lac operon fusions to the putA gene show constitutive expression of , - galactosidase , but proline - dependent regulation is restored when the putA 211 gene is supplied in trans , demonstrating that repression occurs at the transcriptional level ( 14 ) .
Taken together , these results strongly suggest that the PutA protein negatively regulates transcription of the put operon .
The put control region was identified by isolation of cis - acting regulatory mutants ( 8 ) .
Promoter up mutations for putA and putP map in a region between the two structural genes .
Operator constitutive mutants which overexpress both the putA and putP genes also map in the same deletion intervals .
DNA sequence analysis indicates that the region between the putA and putP structural genes is 420 bp long ( 7 ) .
Immediately upstream of the putA gene is a potential promoter for putA and a potential promoter for putP .
Between these two promoters is a 27 - bp sequence of dyad symmetry that could serve as an operator site ( Fig. 1 ) .
On the basis of these results , a model was proposed to explain how the PutA protein might regulate gene expression .
In the presence of proline , the PutA protein becomes membrane associated and the put genes are fully expressed ; however , in the absence of proline the PutA protein may remain in the cytoplasm , where it is able to bind the operator site between the putA and the putP promoters , precluding expression of both genes .
This model accounts for most of the observations except that it does not explain the function of the approximately 380 - bp untranslated leader sequence for putP .
The regulatory region is highly conserved in S. typhimurium , Escherichia coli , and Klebsiella aerogenes ( 1 , 8 , 19 ) .
Such long untranslated leader sequences without a function are not common in procaryotic systems .
Thus , we expected that additional features of the control region may be involved in regulation of the put operon .
In this study , we demonstrate that PutA protein binds to multiple sites in the put control region in - vitro and that the DNA in the put control region is curved .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and media .
All strains used were derivatives of S. typhimurium LT2 .
Strain MS62 contains a large deletion of the put operon ( Aput - 557 ) that extends from a site within the putP gene to a site within the putA gene , resulting in a PutA - PutP - phenotype ( 12 ) .
Strain MS1210 has a Mu dJ insertion in the putA gene , resulting in a PutA - phenotype and a putA : : lacZ operon fusion .
Nutrient broth ( Difco Laboratories , Detroit , Mich. ) with 0.5 % NaCl ( NB ) was used as a rich - medium .
NCE ( 21 ) was used for the minimal - medium .
Minimal medium was supplemented with 0.6 % sodium succinate ( uninduced ) or 0.6 % sodium succinate and 0.2 % proline ( induced ) .
Plasmid pPC6 , a pBR322 derivative that carries the entire put operon ( 7 ) , was digested to completion with either ClaI or Hindlll ( Bethesda Research Laboratories , Inc. [ BRL ] , Gaithersburg , Md. ) restriction endonuclease .
The linear DNAs were extracted with phenol - chloroform , ethanol precipitated ( 13 ) , and then digested with Bal3l exonuclease as recommended by the supplier ( New England BioLabs , Beverly , Mass. ) .
The reactions were stopped after 1 , 2 , or 3 min by adding ethylene glycol - bis ( P - aminoethyl ether ) - N , N , N ' , N ' - tetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) to a final concentration of 20 ptM .
The resulting deletions were directly religated by using T4 DNA ligase .
Each of the Bal3 deletion plasmids was moved into S. typhimurium MS62 by electroporation .
Cells were grown to mid - log phase , centrifuged at 4,000 x g for 10 min at 40C , washed with 1 volume of 1 mM N - 2-hydroxyethylpiperazine - N ' -2 - ethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) , washed with 1/2 volume of the same buffer , then washed with 1/50 volume of 10 % glycerol .
The washed cells were resuspended in 1/500 of the original volume of 10 % glycerol , and 40 1 ± l of these prepared cells was used for each electroporation .
Electroporation was done by using A Bio - Rad Gene Pulser ( Bio - Rad , Richmond , Calif. ) .
Electroporation conditions were as follows : capacitance , 25 p ~ F ; resistance , 200 fil ; and voltage , 2.5 kV Typical time constants were approximately 4 ins .
After electroporation , the cells were grown in NB for about 30 min , and then transformants containing the plasmid were selected on NB - ampicillin ( 50 jxg/ml ) plates .
The Bal3l deletion plasmids isolated from the transformants were purified , and the DNA sequence of the double - stranded plasmids was determined by using Sequenase ( U.S. Biochemical Corp. , Cleveland , Ohio ) .
173 , 1991 Amplification of labeled DNA fragments .
DNA from the put control region was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , using 32P - end - labeled primers ( 10 ) .
The PCR reaction mix contained 20 pmol of a labeled primer that would anneal to the 5 ' end of one strand and 20 pmol of an unlabeled primer that would anneal to the 5 ' end of the opposite strand of the template .
In addition , the reaction mix contained 200 , uM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate , 0.075 , ug of plasmid template , 20 RI of 5 x PCR buffer ( 50 mM Tris hydrochloride [ pH 8.0 ] , 15 mM MgCl2 , 0.25 % Tween 20 , 0.25 % Nonidet P - 40 ) , and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) in a final volume of 100 Rl .
Thirty cycles of amplification were done , with denaturation of the template at 93 °C for 1 min , annealing of the template to the primer at 45 °C for 2 min , and DNA polymerization at 72 °C for 2 min .
The primers were labeled with [ y - 32P ] ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase .
To label 200 pmol of primer , the following reactants were used : 1.2 mCi [ y - 32P ] ATP ( 5,000 Ci/mmol ; DuPont - New England Nuclear , Wilmington , Del. ) , 10 , ul of 50 mM MgCl2 , 5 , ul of 1 M Tris hydrochloride ( pH - 7.6 ) , 5 , ul of 200 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , and 15 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase ( BRL ) in a total volume of 50 , ul .
The reaction mix was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min .
An additional 15 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase was then added , and the reaction mix was incubated at 37 °C for another 45 min .
The labeled primers were separated from unincorporated [ y - 32P ] ATP by filtration through Sep Pak C18 cartridges ( Waters Millipore , Milford , Mass. ) and resuspended in 10 , u1 of distilled H20 .
The 4X174 , lambda , and pBR322 DNAs used as controls for nonspecific DNA binding were directly end labeled by polynucleotide kinase .
The HindlIl - digested lambda ( lambda/HindIII ) standard ( BRL ) was further digested with the ClaI restriction endonuclease , and the pBR322 DNA was digested with HaeIII ( BRL ) .
Then the three samples of DNA ( 4 ) X174/HaeIII [ BRL ] , lambda/HindIII/ClaI , and pBR322/HaeIII ) were treated with 10 U of bacterial alkaline phosphatase ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , Ind. ) at 60 °C for 1 h prior to end labeling with 300 RCi of [ , y - 32P ] ATP and 15 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase as described above .
The unincorporated labeled phosphate was then removed by ethanol precipitation ( 13 ) .
PutA protein was purified as described previously ( 17 ) .
Purified PutA protein was stored in G buffer ( 30 % glycerol , 70 mM Tris , pH 8.2 ) at -70 °C to maintain its stability .
Different molar ratios of PutA protein in G buffer were mixed with 32P - labeled put control region DNA or nonspecific DNA and excess unlabeled plasmid DNA and were incubated at room temperature for 15 min .
G buffer was added to each reaction to yield a final concentration of 1/10 G buffer ( 3 % glycerol , 7 mM Tris , pH 8.2 ) .
The DNA fragments were then separated by electrophoresis on 10 % polyacrylamide gels with a 30:0.8 acrylamide - tobisacrylamide ratio .
Electrophoresis was carried out in Trisborate - EDTA buffer ( 89 mM Tris , 89 mM boric acid , 2.5 mM EDTA ) at 15 - V/cm constant voltage until the bromophenol blue dye in the 4XX174/HaeIII standard reached the end of the gel .
The gels were dried and autoradiographed .
Gel retardation of DNA fragments from the put control region was identical when the binding assay was done in a 1/10 dilution of G buffer , 1 x medium salt restriction enzyme buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl2 ) , or lx in vitro transcription buffer ( 50 mM Tris hydrochloride [ pH 8.0 ] , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 50 mM KCl , 0.05 mg of gelatin per ml ) .
However , when the binding buffer contained NaCl concentrations of .80 mM , gel - retardation was completely prevented .
In addition , as observed for some PutA PROTEIN BINDS DNA IN VITRO 213 other DNA - binding proteins ( 20 ) , the indicator dyes bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol also inhibit gel - retardation by PutA protein .
A surprising observation was that use of a 38:2 acrylamide - to - bisacrylamide ratio prevented gel - retardation by PutA protein , possibly because a smaller pore size inhibits migration of the large PutA protein .
A similar electrophoresis procedure was used to examine altered electrophoretic mobility due to intrinsic curvature of different subfragments of the put regulatory region .
However , in this case the DNA produced by the PCR was not radioactively labeled , no protein was added , and electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C in 8 and 10 % polyacrylamide gels .
Fragments containing the regions of DNA predicted to curve were amplified from the put control region by using PCR as described above .
The fragments from oligonucleotide 6 to oligonucleotide 8 and from oligonucleotide 5 to oligonucleotide 7 were cloned into the Sall site of plasmid pBEND2 ( 26 ) .
The PCR - amplified fragments and the Sall - digested vector were treated with Klenow fragment ( BRL ) and 50 p.M each dATP , dCTP , dGTP , and dTTP for 1 h at 37 °C , phenol extracted , and ethanol precipitated .
The blunt - ended fragments were then ligated at 25 °C for 18 h with T4 DNA ligase ( BRL ) .
The plasmid DNA was isolated and digested with the following enzymes : BglII , XhoI , EcoRV , PvuII , SmaI , NruI , and BamHI ( BRL ) .
Electrophoresis of the digests was carried out in 10 % polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C .
Cells were grown to mid - log phase in NCE - succinate medium ( uninduced conditions ) and in NCEsuccinate - proline medium ( induced conditions ) .
Proline oxidase was assayed as described by Dendinger and Brill ( 2 ) .
Proline oxidase activity is expressed as nanomoles of proline oxidized per minute per unit of optical density at 650 nm ( OD650 ) of the cell suspension .
Proline transport was assayed as described by Ekena et al. ( 4 ) .
Proline transport activity is expressed as nanomoles of proline transported per minute per milligram of protein .
P - Galactosidase was assayed by using the chloroform - sodium dodecyl sulfate procedure described by Miller ( 18 ) .
P - Galactosidase activity is expressed as nanomoles of o - nitrophenyl - p-D - galactoside ( ONPG ) hydrolyzed per minute per OD650 of the cell suspension .
Computer analysis of put DNA sequences was done with the DNAstar ( DNAstar , Madison , Wis. ) software package .
The predicted DNA bends were found with the BEND program ; this program is based on the wedge model for curved DNA , in which a small bend at ApA dinucleotides distributed with helical periodicity in a DNA sequence is predicted to cause intrinsic curvature ( 22 ) .
For computing the helix trajectory , the tilt angle at the ApA wedge is taken as 2.40 , opening toward the AA dinucleotide , and the roll angle is taken as 8.40 , opening toward the major groove .
The potential secondary operator sites were located by using the ALIGN program , based on the Wilbur - Lipman algorithm ( 23 ) , to find sequences similar to the sequence originally proposed to be the unique put operator .
RESULTS PutA protein is a DNA - binding protein in - vitro .
Although genetic studies suggested that the putA gene encodes a trans - acting repressor for the put operon ( 14 ) , there was no direct evidence that the PutA protein could bind to DNA .
To determine whether purified PutA protein binds to the put control region DNA in - vitro , we assayed DNA binding by using gel - retardation assays ( 5 , 6 ) .

Lanes : 1 through 4 , 0.66 nM 4X174/HaeIII DNA ; 5 through 8 , 0.61 nM pBR322/HaeIII DNA ; 9 through 12 , 0.70 nM lambda/HindIIVClaI DNA ; 13 through 15 , 0.91 nM DNA fragment from the wild - type put control region ; amplified with oligonucleotides 5 and 8 .
Lanes 1 , 5 , 9 , and 13 did not contain any PutA protein .
Subsequent lanes contained increasing concentrations of PutA protein : lanes 2 , 6 , and 10 contained 56 nM PutA protein ; lanes 3 , 7 , 11 , and 14 contained 112 nM PutA protein ; and lanes 4 , 8 , 12 , and 15 contained 224 nM PutA protein .
mobility of a DNA fragment carrying the wild - type put control region was specifically retarded by purified PutA protein ( Fig. 2B , WT6 ,2 ) .
At concentrations of PutA protein that bind to the put control region , PutA protein did not bind to DNA lacking the put control region , including 4X174 DNA , phage lambda DNA , and pBR322 DNA ( Fig. 2C ) .
PutA protein bounds to the wild - type put control region at a molar ratio of approximately 100 : 1 ( Fig. 2B ) .
At molar ratios of PutA protein to DNA of approximately 800:1 , some nonspecific DNA binding was observed ( Fig. 2C ) , and at molar ratios of PutA protein to DNA of 1,600:1 , considerable nonspecific binding was observed ( data not shown ) .
In addition , PutA protein did not bind to a fragment from within the put control region which lacks putative operator sites even at molar ratios of PutA protein to DNA of 800:1 ( Fig. 2C , WT5 ,8 ) .
These results indicate that PutA protein is a DNA - binding protein specific for the put control region .
DNA sequence analysis of the put control region .

Computer - predicted curvature of the put control region .
The sites numbered 200 and 230 correspond to the same sites in Fig. 1 , located at each side of the ClaI site .
prominent features of the put regulatory region are shown in Fig. 1 .
The 27 - bp sequence of dyad symmetry labeled 0 - 1 was originally proposed to be the unique operator site ( 6 ) .
It is possible that the long untranslated leader sequence contains secondary operator sites .
To investigate this possibility , we searched the DNA sequence for similar sequences .
The sequences 0 - 2 through 0 - 5 in Fig. 1 represent additional operatorlike sequences .
Another role of this region may be to promote DNA curvature .
Two major intrinsic bends are predicted by computer analysis to occur at each side of the ClaI site ( Fig. 3 ) , around the positions labeled 200 and 230 in Fig. 1 .
To determine whether these features actually have a role in put regulation , we made small deletions in the regulatory region ( Fig. 4 ) and studied their effect on binding of purified PutA protein in - vitro and on put expression in vivo .
PutA protein binds to multiple sites in the put control region .
To determine whether PutA protein binds to multiple sites in the put control region , we assayed gel - retardation of DNA fragments from each of the deletions by PutA protein .
PutA protein bound to control region DNA from each of the deletion mutants ( Fig. 2 ) .
Since none of the deletions removed the potential operator site 0 - 5 ( Fig. 4 ) , we also tested PutA binding to DNA fragments produced by PCR amplification that contained only that potential operator site .
PutA protein bound to the fragment made from primers 6 to 8 as well as the fragment made from primers 5 to 2 , containing the rest of the put control region ( Fig. 2A ) .
Furthermore , PutA protein also bound to these fragments after digestion with ClaI , eliminating overlapping sequences shared by the fragments ( Fig. 2A ) .
These results indicate that there are multiple binding sites for the PutA protein in the put control region .
DNA from the put control region is curved .
A second feature that may be involved in regulation is the potential bending of the put control region ( Fig. 3 ) .
The presence of curved DNA in the put control region was tested by observing the electrophoretic mobility of different subfragments of the put control region .
As DNA snakes through a gel during electrophoresis , it must constantly reorient to find the gel pores and pass through them .
This rate - limiting step is slower for curved DNA than for typical B - form DNA when the size of the gel pores decreases ( 15 ) .
Different fragments of put control region DNA were obtained by PCR amplification , using primers that annealed to different sites in the control region ( Fig. 4 ) .
The fragments amplified from oligonucleotide 6 to oligonucleotide 2 or to oligonucleotide 4 showed a large decrease in mobility as the polyacrylamide concentration was increased , as expected for curved DNA ( Table 1 ) .
To confirm these results , we carried out circular permutations of put control region subfragments ( 25 ) .
To make the circular permutations , the two PCR - amplified subfragments from oligonucleotide 6 to oligonucleotide 8 and from oligonucleotide 5 to oligonucleotide 7 were cloned into putP .

Circular permutations of the 6 - 8 fragment exhibited equal mobilities ( data not shown ) .
However , circular permutations of the 5 - 7 fragment showed increased retardation as they were cut from the BglII site to the BamHI site , located at the far left and far right , respectively , of the duplicated restriction sites ( Fig .
These results indicate that the DNA to the right of the ClaI site in the put control region is curved .
Plotting and extrapolation of the electrophoretic mobilities of these fragments versus the distance of the cloned 5 - 7 fragment from the left and right ends of the circularly permuted fragments indicated that the curved DNA is located near the region of the computer - predicted curvature labeled 230 in Fig. 1 ( Fig .
Sites throughout the put control region are involved in regulation of the put operon .
To determine whether the removal of potential operator sites or DNA bending sites affected put regulation , we assayed expression of the put genes in each of the deletion mutants .
Expression of putA was assayed by measuring proline oxidase ( Table 2 ) , and expression of putP was assayed by measuring proline transport ( Table 3 ) .
Both the deletions from the ClaI site and those from the HindIlI site affected putA and putP expression , but the effect on expression of the two genes differed as described below .
Each of the ClaI deletions showed a higher basal level of proline oxidase activity , but they were still induced by proline .
The HindlIl deletions removed the putA promoter predicted from sequence analysis ( 7 ) and eliminated proline oxidase activity , indicating that this is the putA promoter used in - vivo .
Oligonucleotide extension analysis further confirmed that this is the functional putA promoter ( 2 ) .
Thus , the ClaI deletions remove sites in the put control region , upstream of the putA promoter , that are involved in repression of the putA gene .
Except for deletion H3 - 7 , expression of the putP gene in all of the deletion mutants was still induced by proline .
Compared with the wild type and other deletions , deletions Cl - S and H3 - 4 caused higher basal levels ofputP expression , C1 - 3 and C3 - 13 caused lower levels of putP expression , and H3 - 6 caused lower levels of putP expression .
These results indicate that multiple sites in the put control region are involved in regulation of putP gene expression in - vivo .
Deletion H3 - 7 , which removed the potential putP promoter P1 , did not express putP .
However , deletion C1 - S , which removed the potential promoter P3 , and deletion H3 - 4 , which removed P2 , still expressed putP .
These data strongly suggest that P1 is the major putP promoter used in - vivo .
Deletions that remove the putA promoter but retain PutA repressor function .
Both deletions H3 - 4 and H3 - 6 remove the putA promoter and therefore lack proline oxidase activity .
No apparent new promoters for putA are created in these deletions .
However , to our surprise , putP expression in both H3 - 4 and H3 - 6 was induced by proline .
This finding raised the question of whether the observed regulation is mediated by the PutA protein .
To answer this question , the putA structural gene was disrupted with Bal31 deletions in plasmids carrying deletion H3 - 4 ( Fig. 6 ) , and their ability to regulate put gene expression in trans was tested .
The original H3 - 4 deletion plasmid , the H3 - 4 plasmids containing the additional deletions in the putA structural gene , and the wild - type pPC6 plasmid were then moved into strain MS1210 .
MS1210 contains a chromosomal putA : : lac operon fusion , and therefore expression of P - galactosidase is regulated from the putA promoter .
Expression of , - galactosidase from each these strains was assayed ( Table 4 ) .
In the absence of a complementing plasmid , P - galactosidase was expressed constitutively from the chromosomal putA : : lac operon fusion .
When pPC6 or H3 - 4 was introduced , expression of f - galactosidase from the putA : : lac operon fusion was regulated by proline .
Thus , H3 - 4 produces a factor that can act in trans to repress the putA : : lacZ fusion .
This repressor either is less efficient than the one made from the wild - type plasmid pPC6 or is produced in lower amounts .
Deletions in the putA structural gene disrupt this trans - acting repressor function .
These results indicate that the trans - acting factor produced by H3 - 4 that represses put expression is encoded by the putA gene .
The PutA protein made by H3 - 4 must be able to bind to the operator site ( s ) and also bind proline since it functions in regulation , but it is defective for proline oxidase activity .
DISCUSSION Genetic analysis of the putA gene suggests that it encodes an unusual multifunctional protein that acts as membraneassociated dehydrogenase and also regulates transcription of the put operon .
Although the phenotypes of putA mutants imply that the putA gene encodes a trans - acting repressor for the put operon , there was no direct evidence that the PutA protein binds to DNA .
Therefore , we determined whether purified PutA protein binds to put control region DNA in vitro by gel - retardation assays .
The electrophoretic mobility of a DNA fragment carrying the put control region was Strain TABLE 2 .

specifically retarded by purified PutA protein .
Several lines of evidence indicate that the gel - retardation is due to PutA protein : ( i ) in every purified PutA preparation , the DNAbinding activity was directly proportional to the PutA enzymatic activity ( 11 ) ; ( ii ) if the PutA protein was removed by immunoprecipitation , the gel - retardation activity was lost ( 11 ) ; ( iii ) when protein was purified from putA deletion mutants in an identical fashion , the DNA - binding activity was absent ( 11 ) ; ( iv ) the concentration of PutA protein required for gel - retardation in - vitro was very similar to the concentration of PutA protein under repressed conditions in vivo ( 12 ) ; and ( v ) extensive genetic evidence indicates that the PutA protein functions as a repressor in - vivo ( 14 , 16 ) .
These results indicate that the putA gene encodes a DNAbinding protein specific for the put control region .
Regulation of the put operon was originally proposed to be the result of interactions between the PutA repressor protein and a single operator site .
The best candidate for this operator site was the sequence labeled 0 - 1 in Fig. 1 .
The reasons for this proposal were ( i ) this sequence is located between the two putative promoters , in agreement with the genetic mapping of operator constitutive mutants ( 7 ) ; ( ii ) the 218 OSTROVSKY DE SPICER ET AL. .

sequence showed dyad symmetry , consistent with the fact that PutA protein forms dimers ; and ( iii ) the position of this sequence suggested a simple single operator model in which binding of PutA protein to this site could preclude transcription from both diverging promoters .
However , if this were the only regulatory site in the put control region , the conserved long untranslated leader that precedes the putP gene would have no apparent function .
Two possible features of this region predicted from computer analysis were the presence of curved DNA and the presence of multiple operator sites .
Evidence for both of these features was obtained : abnormal electrophoretic behavior of put control region DNA and circular permutation data revealed the presence of curved DNA , and the PutA protein was shown to bind to multiple sites in the put control region .
To determine whether these features were involved in regulation of the put operon , we constructed small deletions that removed specific portions of the control region .
These deletions were tested for their ability to bind purified PutA protein and for their effects on put gene expression .
PutA protein bound to DNA from the put control region from each of the deletion mutants .
These in - vitro results suggest that multiple operator sites may be involved in put regulation .
All the deletions affected expression of both putA and putP .
Expression of putA was absent when the promoter PA was removed ( deletions H3 - 4 , H3 - 6 , and H3 - 7 ) .
However , when regions that contain curved DNA were removed ( deletion C1 - 3 ) , or when both regions with potentially curved DNA and potential operator sites were removed ( deletions C1 - 5 and C3 - 13 ) , the basal level of putA expression was higher but still induced by proline .
Thus , the sites containing potential operators or curved DNA are required for full TABLE 4 .

repression of put expression , but removal of these sites does not abolish repression completely , suggesting that more than a single operator site is needed to achieve full repression in vivo .
Except for deletion H3 - 7 , which removes the P1 promoter , expression of the putP gene in each one of the deletion mutants was still induced by proline .
However , in contrast to their effect on putA expression , deletions C1 - 3 and C3 - 13 showed lower levels of expression of putP .
They removed 11.5 and 16.4 turns , respectively , of a helix ; this could cause a change in the phasing of the untranslated leader that favors a more repressed state , even though induction is still possible .
Deletions Cl - S and H3 - 4 showed higher levels of expression than did the wild - type .
Cl - 5 is missing the region predicted to bend and 0 - 4 , while H3 - 4 is missing 0 - 1 , 0 - 2 , and 0 - 3 and the competing putA promoter .
Some or all of these features may account for the increased putP expression .
On the other hand , H3 - 6 showed a lower level of expression of putP .
The deletion created in H3 - 6 is very similar to the one in H3 - 4 in that it takes out the putA promoter and 0 - 2 , but 0 - 1 and 0 - 3 are still present and placed contiguously .
If these two sites actually work as operators , their positioning in this deletion may increase their repressing efficiency .
This may be due to cooperativity between PutA protein molecules bound to both sites or merely increased steric hindrance of RNA polymerase by a greater number of operator sites filled with repressor .
Taken together , the in - vitro and in - vivo results strongly suggest that multiple sites are needed for full repression of the put operon .
These results suggest a more complex model for regulation of the put operon .
In the absence of proline , PutA protein may accumulate in the cytoplasm and bind to multiple operator sites in the put control region .

173 , 1991 bility in the curved untranslated leader .
Under inducing conditions , proline oxidation would reduce the tightly associated flavin adenine dinucleotide coenzyme , inducing the PutA protein to become membrane associated and abandon the operator sites , thus permitting expression of the put genes .
In some respects , regulation of the put operon may be similar to regulation of the ara operon .
The ara control region contains multiple operator sites that regulate transcription of the divergent araC and araBAD genes .
Proper contact between AraC proteins bound at different operator sites is facilitated by looping of the long stretch of DNA that separates them ( 9 ) .
Likewise , the put operon also has multiple operator sites separated by a long untranslated sequence containing curved DNA that could facilitate DNA looping .
Although the mechanism of regulation of the put operon may share some features with regulation of the ara operon , the PutA repressor is unique .
The molecular size of the PutA protein monomer is 132 kDa , much larger than other characterized repressor proteins .
Furthermore , the PutA protein functions both as a repressor protein and as an enzyme that catalyzes two different catabolic steps in the oxidation of proline , one of which requires membrane association .
Therefore , the PutA protein must bind proline , flavin adenine dinucleotide , NAD , the membrane , and DNA .
Since PutA protein is quite different from other known repressors , we are now trying to determine precisely how it interacts with DNA .
