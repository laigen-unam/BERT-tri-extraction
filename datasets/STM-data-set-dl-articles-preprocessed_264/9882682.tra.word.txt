181 , No. 2 0021 - 9193/99 / $ 04.00 0 NAD - Dependent DNA - Binding Activity of the Bifunctional NadR Regulator of Salmonella typhimurium THOMAS PENFOUND † AND JOHN W. FOSTER * Department of Microbiology and Immunology , College of Medicine , University of South Alabama , Mobile , Alabama 36688 NadR is a 45 - kDa bifunctional regulator protein .
In vivo genetic studies indicate that NadR represses three genes involved in the biosynthesis of NAD .
It also participates with an integral membrane protein ( PnuC ) in the import of nicotinamide mononucleotide , an NAD precursor .
NadR was overexpressed and purified as a His - tagged fusion in order to study its DNA - binding properties .
The protein bound to DNA fragments containing NAD box consensus sequences .
NAD proved to be the relevant in - vivo corepressor , but full NAD dependence of repressor activity required nucleotide triphosphates .
DNA footprint analysis and gel shift assays suggest that NadR binds as a multimer to adjacent NAD boxes .
The DNA - repressor complex would sequester a potential RNA polymerase binding site and thereby decrease expression of the nad regulon .
The pyridine - nucleotides NAD and NADP play central roles in cellular metabolism .
Because of the broad impact of NAD cellular physiology , maintenance of optimal levels of this pyridine nucleotide is critical for efficient cell growth .
Genes involved in the recycling ( pncB ) and biosynthesis ( nadB and the nadA - pnuC operon ) of NAD are transcriptionally repressed in Salmonella typhimurium by the product of nadR ( 7 ) , also referred to as nadI ( 34 ) .
Regulation by NadR presumably occurs in response to internal NAD concentrations , although this has never been shown directly ( 16 , 32 ) .
In addition to its role as a transcriptional regulator , NadR is also important in the transport of nicotinamide mononucleotide ( NMN ) as an exogenous precursor of NAD ( 8 , 19 , 23 , 32 ) .
The transport of this phosphorylated compound requires both NadR and PnuC , an apparent integral membrane protein .
PnuC transporter activity is modulated by NadR in response to internal pyridine nucleotide levels ( 23 , 32 , 33 ) .
The cloning and sequencing of this locus confirmed that a single gene complements both transport and transcriptional regulator functions , establishing NadR as a unique bifunctional regulator ( 8 ) .
Other known bifunctional transcriptional regulators , such as the biotin holoenzyme synthetase , BirA ( 1 ) , and the PutA proline dehydrogenase , have enzymatic activities as their second function ( 21 , 22 ) .
NadR , in contrast , does not appear to have an enzymatic activity but regulates the activity of the PnuC transporter .
Single - strand conformational polymorphisms of PCR - amplified regions from various nadR mutants have shown that both transport and regulatory phenotypes map within the nadR open reading frame ( 9 ) .
Those studies also established that repressor function primarily resides within the amino - terminal half of the protein while transport function is associated with the carboxyl end .
In this study , wild - type NadR and a His - tagged NadR fusion protein were purified to provide in - vitro DNA binding evidence for the regulatory function of this protein .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and media .
The bacterial strains used in this work are listed in Table 1 .
Plasmid pGP1 - 2 was a gift from S. Tabor ( 25 ) .
The medium used was the minimal E medium , containing 0.4 % glucose and Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium , of Vogel and Bonner ( 29 ) .
Ampicillin ( Ap ) ( 60 g/ml ) , chloramphenicol ( Cm ) ( 30 g/ml ) , and kanamycin ( Km ) ( 50 g/ml ) were added as needed .
pFW38 - 46 was used to produce wild - type NadR for purification .
It contains an intact , wild - type nadR gene controlled by its natural promoter and a T7 promoter ( 8 ) .
To produce His - tagged NadR , a 1.2 - kb nadR fragment was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b ( Novagen , Madison , Wis. ) .
The nadR fragment was produced by PCR amplification from the chromosome of S. typhimurium by using oligonucleotide primers oligo 40 ( GAGGCTCATATGTCATCGTTC ; overlaps the nadR start codon ) and oligo 41 ( GCTGGATCCGAAGCGTATC ; starts at nucleotide 1392 [ 8 ] ) .
The primers were designed ( see underlined bases ) to incorporate restriction sites for NdeI ( oligo 40 ) and BamHI ( oligo 41 ) .
Cleaving the PCR product with NdeI and BamHI removes the nadR Shine - Dalgarno sequence .
The resulting plasmid , pFP129 , will not express nadR without specific induction by isopropyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) , a feature that allowed stable maintenance of this plasmid in EF258 and EF270 .
Plasmid pTF23 containing nadA on a 1.9 - kb insert was described previously ( 26 ) .
A 1.4 - kb HincII fragment from pTF23 was subcloned into pTZ19R ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) , producing pFP79 .
A 354 - bp HaeIII - HpaII fragment from pFP79 containing the predicted nadA operator was subcloned into pTZ19R , producing pFP80 .
A 377 - bp KpnI - PstI fragment from pFP80 was used for some gel - retardation experiments .
A 174 - bp Fnu4HI fragment from pFP80 containing both NAD boxes of the nadA operator was blunt ended with T7 DNA polymerase and ligated to HincII - digested pBluescript SK ( ) , producing plasmid pFP108 .
A 200 - bp XhoI - HindIII fragment from pFP108 , also containing both NAD boxes , was subcloned into pSP70 ( Promega , Madison , Wis. ) , producing pFP132 .
This plasmid was used to amplify and label the nadA operator by using the SP6 and T7 primers that flank the insert .
The product was a 225 - bp fragment .
For pncB - NadR interactions , a 300 - bp SalI - NdeI fragment of pRM18 .1 ( 28 ) carrying the pncB operator was gel purified and ligated into pSP70 to generate pFP204 .
Strains of Escherichia coli and galE mutants of Salmonella were transformed by a rapid CaCl 2 method ( 12 , 27 ) .
Purification of wild - type NadR .
Wild - type NadR was purified from cells ( JF1947 ) grown to late log phase in E glucose with Ap , Km , and 0.1 mM NMN by established methods ( 25 ) .
35 S - labelled NadR , used as a tracer during purification , was prepared from a 100 - ml culture .
Rifampin was added to 300 g/ml to inhibit host RNA polymerase , and after 30 min 10 Ci of 35 S - Trans label ( ICN ) per ml was added and the culture was then incubated for 5 min before harvesting .
A small amount of labelled [ 35 S ] NadR - containing cells ( 0.1 g , wet weight ) was added to 20 g ( wet weight ) of unlabelled NadR - overproducing cells in two volumes of buffer A ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA , and 1.0 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] ) with 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) added just before sonication .
Crude sonicate is shown in Fig. 1A , lane 2 .
Cleared lysate obtained after centrifugation at 20,000 g for 20 min ( 4 °C ) is shown in Fig. 1A , lane 3 .
Cleared lysate was subjected to precipitation with polyethylenimine ( PEI ; Sigma ) ( 10 % [ wt/vol ] , pH 8.0 ; 35 l/ml of lysate ) ( 3a ) .
The pellet was washed in buffer A containing 0.4 M NaCl , collected by centrifugation , and homogenized in buffer A with 1.0 M NaCl to extract NadR .
The NadR - containing supernatant was brought to 60 % saturation with solid ammo - 648 VOL .

Precipitated proteins , including NadR , were recovered by centrifugation and redissolved in buffer A , and the solution was clarified by centrifugation ( Fig. 1A , lane 4 ) .
The clarified solution was subjected to chromatography through an Affi - Gel Blue column ( 1 cm wide by 15 cm long ; Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , Calif. ) .
NadR eluted at 0.7 M NaCl in a0to1 .0 MNaCl linear gradient .
NadR - containing radioactive fractions were combined and brought to 55 % saturation with ammonium sulfate , and the precipitate was dissolved in 20 ml of buffer A ( Fig. 1A , lane 5 ) .
This material was loaded onto a DE - 52 column ( Whatman ) ( 1 cm wide by 8 cm long ) , and NadR eluted at 0.2 M NaCl in a0to 0.5 M NaCl linear gradient in buffer A. Radioactive fractions containing NadR were precipitated with ammonium sulfate ( 60 % saturation ) and resuspended in buffer A ( Fig. 1A , lane 6 ) .
Partially purified NadR was stored as an ammonium sulfate suspension at 4 °C .
Purification of His - tagged NadR .
EF270 containing pFP129 was grown to an optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of 0.5 in 100 ml of LB - medium containing Ap and Cm and induced with 1.0 mM IPTG for 2 h. Cells were harvested , lysed , and purified from a Ni 2 - charged metal chelate column per the recommendations of the manufacturer ( Novagen ) .
Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio - Rad protein assay ( 2 ) .
Sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) was performed by using 11.5 % acrylamide ( gels 18 ) .
Since the His - tagged NadR performed as well as wild - type NadR in gel - retardation assays ( data not shown ) , the 20 - amino - acid tag was not removed for this study .
When needed , radiolabelled His - tagged NadR was produced by growing EF270 in E medium to an OD 600 of 0.5 .
Expression was induced with 1.0 mM IPTG for 0.5 h , after which 20 Ci of 35 S - Trans label ( ICN ) per ml was added for 1.5 h and the culture was harvested .
Band shift or gel - retardation assays were performed in 3 % polyacrylamide gels ( 10 , 11 ) .
The acrylamide gels were aged for 24 to 96 h or prerun ( 10 V/cm for 1 h ) .
Radiolabelled DNA fragments were prepared by using pFP132 , containing the nadA promoter , in a standard PCR protocol employing SP6 and T7 oligonucleotide primers , with one of the primers being end labelled with 32 P by using T4 polynucleotide kinase .
After PCR amplification , the labeled fragment ( 225 bp ) was purified ( Promega Wizard PCR cleanup resin ; direct extraction technique ) .
The same PCR strategy was used for the pncB operator with the substitution of pFP204 as the template , producing a 370 - bp labelled fragment .
Band shift assays were performed in 30 - l reaction volumes that included approximately 5,000 cpm of labelled operator DNA , 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 50 mM KCl , 1.0 mM DTT , 75 g of acetylated bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) per ml , 1.0 mM EDTA , and 10 mM MgCl 2 .
Additions made to the core binding mix were NadR , NAD , and ATP at 6.4 nM , 600 M , and 60 M , respectively , unless indicated otherwise .
When used , competitor DNA ( pTZ19R ) was added to 25 g/ml .
Wild - type or His - tagged NadR was added to the reaction mixture last , in a small volume ( less than 5 % of the total reaction volume ) .
The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min .
Eight microliters of ice - cold gel loading buffer ( stock solution ; 33 % glycerol and 0.03 % bromphenol blue ) was added , and the sample was mixed by gentle stirring to avoid shearing .
The samples were immediately loaded onto polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 4 °C and 10 V/cm in Tris - borate - EDTA -- 3 % polyacrylamide gels .
Stoichiometry and gel filtration .
To determine the molar ratio of NadR protein bound to DNA , gel - retardation assays were performed by using 3 H - labelled NadR and 32 P - labelled nadA operator fragments ( 225 - bp fragments ; see above ) .
The specific activities of the DNA and His - tagged NadR samples were determined to be 1.7 10 10 and 1.2 10 9 mol/dpm , respectively .
The gel was sliced into 1 cm by 1 cm squares and digested for 24 h at 42 °C in 100 l of21 % H 2 O 2 with 16 % perchlorate before addition of scintillant .
Differential counts were performed in a Beckman LS6800 scintillation counter and an LKB 1219 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter .
To determine its molecular weight in solution , His - tagged NadR was loaded onto Sephacryl S - 300 columns equilibrated with Novagen 0.1 eluate buffer with 1 % dimethyl sulfoxide .
His - tagged NadR was loaded at several concentrations ( ranging from 0.05 to 2.0 mg/ml ) onto a 1.5 cm ( inside diameter ) by 45 cm ( outside diameter ) column at a flow rate of 0.17 ml/min .
Primer pair T7 and SP6 , with one primer end labelled with 32 P , was used in standard PCRs to generate NAD box - containing target fragments from pFP132 ( nadA ) or pFP204 ( pncB ) .
DNA - binding reactions for footprinting were carried out in 130 - l reaction volumes containing 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7.9 ) , 50 mM KCl , 1.0 mM DTT , 75 g of acetylated BSA per ml , 1.0 mM EDTA , 10 mM MgCl 2 ,25 g of pTZ19R competitor DNA per ml , 32 P - labelled operator DNA fragment at 175 cpm / l , and ATP at 60 M. Histagged NadR and NAD were added as indicated in a given experiment .
The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min , and 30 l was removed for a gel - retardation assay .
The remaining 100 l was treated with 0.1 U of DNase I ( BRL ) and incubated at room temperature for 4 min .
A 46 - l aliquot of DNase stop solution ( 55 mM EDTA , 6.8 M NH 4 CH 3 COOH , and 440 g of tRNA per ml ) was added , and the DNA was ethanol precipitated .
The DNA pellet was dissolved in formamide gel loading buffer ( Promega ) , heated for 5 min at 75 °C , and loaded onto a 6 % Long Ranger sequencing gel ( FMC , Rockland , Maine ) .
Determination of dissociation constants .
The apparent affinities between NadR and the nadA and pncB operators were determined from DNase - I-protection studies .
Binding isotherms were generated from points calculated at different NadR concentrations from the following equation : p i 1 ( OD n , site / OD n , std ) / ( OD r , site / OD r , std ) In this equation , p i represents the fractional protection of the DNA backbone against nuclease cleavage at a specific NadR concentration ( DNase - I-protection ) .
Two types of bands were chosen for comparison within each experimental ( n ) and reference ( no DNase ) ( r ) lane .
One band or set of bands represented NadRprotected regions ( site ) .
The second set of bands ( control bands ) was those located in unprotected regions ( std ) .
Each site and std band was quantified by densitometric analysis .
RESULTS Purification of wild - type and His - tagged NadR .
Wild - type NadR was found to be overexpressed in S. typhimurium when examined using a two - plasmid system in which one plasmid ( pFW38 - 46 ) carried the nadR gene under the control of a T7 phage promoter and a second plasmid ( pGP1 - 2 ) encoded an 650 PENFOUND AND FOSTER J. BACTERIOL .

Molecular mass markers are shown in lanes 1 and 4 .
inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene ( 25 ) .
Wild - type NadR produced in this strain ( JF1947 ) was purified to approximately 70 % ( Fig. 1A ) .
Although this preparation performed well in gel - retardation experiments ( see below ) , attempts to further purify wild - type NadR failed .
Consequently , a His - tag fusion to nadR was constructed in the pET15b vector ( Novagen ) .
Histagged NadR was easily purified to approximately 95 % ( Fig. 1B ) and functioned similarly to wild - type NadR preparations .
NadR specifically binds to nad regulon operator regions .
Previous DNA sequencing studies identified an inverted repeat in the predicted operator of each NadR - regulated gene ( 6 , 8 , 28 , 31 ) .
Subsequent comparisons between these putative operator regions revealed a consensus sequence , referred to as the NAD box , consisting of TGTTTA and its inverted repeat separated by 5 to 6 base pairs , or approximately one - half of a helical turn .
The nadA and nadB operators contain two NAD boxes overlapping potential RNA polymerase binding sites ( box 1 ) and ribosome binding sites ( RBS ) ( box 2 ) , whereas the pncB loci contain only one complete NAD box which overlaps an RBS .
Because of this conservation , the NAD box sequence was predicted to define the NadR binding site .
Gel retardation assays performed using NadR protein and nadA operatorcontaining fragments from pFP79 revealed that NadR specifically bound to a 354 - bp HaeIII - HpaII region that included the putative NAD box region ( Fig. 2 ) .
His - tagged NadR preparations bound to the same fragment ( data not shown ) .
NTPs diminish NAD - independent binding of NadR to operator DNA .
Although the preliminary gel - retardation results suggested that NadR must interact with NAD to effectively bind the operator region ( Fig. 2 ) , we observed that wild - type NadR exhibited NAD - independent binding to operator DNA after extended storage ( for more than 1 month ) of the enzyme at 4 °C ( data not shown ) .
The same phenomenon was observed with freshly purified His - tagged NadR ( Fig. 3A , lane 1 ) .
This result suggested that an effector molecule associated with NadR may have been inactivated during storage ( wild - type NadR ) or lost during purification ( His - tagged NadR ) .
DNA sequence analysis of nadR revealed the presence of a consensus sequence , starting at amino - acid position 237 , that is indicative of a mononucleotide binding site ( 8 , 20 ) .
Because of this observation , various nucleotides were tested for their ability to maintain NadR as an NAD - dependent DNA - binding protein .
DNA band shifts of specific nad operator - containing fragments .
Plasmids pTF23 ( A ) and pFP79 ( B ) contain multiple bacterial promoters , including that of nadA ( hatched box ) .
Each plasmid was digested with the restriction enzymes shown ( bottom ) .
The wild - type NadR preparation exhibited specific binding to DNA fragments containing the nadA promoter/operator .
Gel retardation assays were performed by incubating 100 nM DNA with 200 nM wild - type NadR with or without 666 M NAD ( as indicated in upper panels ) in the gel - retardation mix ( 20 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 50 mM KCl , 1.0 mM DTT , 1.0 mM EDTA , 75 g of acetylated BSA [ Promega ] per ml , 10 mM MgCl 2 ) .
Arrowheads indicate free DNA and NadR - DNA complexes for nadA operator - containing fragments .
Gels were stained with ethidium bromide .

Effects of ribonucleotides ( A ) and pyridine - nucleotides ( B ) on NadR DNA binding .
Panels present band shift results obtained by using His - tagged NadR and radiolabelled nadA operator DNA fragments ( 225 - bp PCR product from pFP132 ) .
Basic assay conditions were as described in Materials and Methods , with 6.5 nM NadR being used in each reaction mixture .
Panel A shows the effect of ribonucleotides on NAD - independent DNA binding by NadR .
NAD and various ribonucleotides were added as indicated .
Panel B shows the identity of the NadR corepressor .
Basic assay conditions were the same as for panel A except that 60 M ATP was added to all binding reaction mixtures .
The indicated pyridine nucleotide cycle intermediates ( nucleotide ) were all added at 660 M. QA , quinolinic acid ; NA , nicotinic acid ; NAMN , nicotinic acid mononucleotide ; NAm , nicotinamide ; NAAD , nicotinic adenine dinucleotide .
ATP prevented the NAD - independent binding of NadR to operator DNA ( Fig. 3A ; compare lanes 1 and 2 ) but did not diminish the effectiveness of NAD as a corepressor ( Fig. 3A ; compare lane 2 with lane 7 and lane 6 with lane 7 ) .
This result was the same whether wild - type or His - tagged NadR preparations were tested .
We also examined whether other nucleotide triphosphates ( NTPs ) could inhibit NAD - independent binding .
GTP , CTP , and UTP all reversed NAD - independent DNA binding ( Fig. 3A , lanes 3 , 4 , and 5 ) while not interfering with NAD - dependent binding ( Fig. 3A , lanes 8 , 9 , and 10 ) .
Mononucleotides had no effect , while dinucleotides did have a slight effect ( data not shown ) .
As a result of this finding , all subsequent gel - retardation assays contained ATP unless indicated otherwise .
NAD is the corepressor for NadR .
There are several compounds within the pyridine nucleotide cycle that could fill the role of corepressor for this system .
Indirect genetic evidence implicating NAD as the corepressor of the NAD regulon has been reported ( 32 ) .
However , no direct evidence has been reported .
Consequently , in - vitro DNA band shift assays were used to prove that NAD , and no other pyridine nucleotide cycle intermediate , is the corepressor for NadR .
The results indicated that only NAD serves as a corepressor at relevant in vivo levels ( Fig. 3B , lane 8 ) .
All other pyridine nucleotide intermediates were invalidated as potential candidates .
While quinolinic acid , nicotinic acid , nicotinic acid mononucleotide , nicotinamide , and nicotinic adenine dinucleotide showed no detectible corepressor activity , NMN , NADH , and NADP were slightly active at 660 M , a concentration 10 - to 100 - fold higher than their measured in - vivo levels .
At physiological levels they had no effect ( data not shown ) .
Thus , the data suggest that NAD is the in - vivo corepressor for this system .
Column chromatography was used to determine the oligomeric state of NadR in solution .
The majority ( 80 % ) of NadR ( 45 kDa ) migrated with an M r of 90 kDa under native conditions on a Sephacryl ( Pharmacia ) S - 300 column , suggesting that , in solution , NadR exists as a dimer ( data not shown ) .
3 H - or 35 S - labelled NadR and 32 P - labelled operator DNA were utilized to determine the number of NadR molecules present in a protein - DNA complex .
Gel slices from one dual - label gel - retardation experiment produced 575 dpm from [ 32 P ] DNA and 281 dpm from [ 3 H ] NadR .
This represented 9.6 10 8 mol of DNA and 3.4 10 7 mol of protein , for a 1:3.5 molar ratio .
A second experiment with 35 S - labelled NadR displayed 429 dpm from 32 P ( 7.3 10 8 mol of DNA ) and 486 dpm from 35 S ( 3.2 10 7 mol of protein ) .
The average from these experiments is four NadR molecules per nadA operator .
This agrees with a model in which a dimer of NadR binds to each NAD box within the operator region .
The results of DNase I footprinting experiments are shown in Fig. 4 ( nadA ) and Fig. 5 ( pncB ) .
Each figure shows the sequence protected by NadR in the nontemplate ( i.e. , coding ) and template strands .
Two regions were protected in nadA , while only one was protected within pncB .
Each protected sequence was centered around the NAD boxes .
The presence of DNase I - hypersensitive sites ( Fig. 4 ) between the two protected NAD box regions in nadA - O is indicative of torsional strain placed on the DNA by bending ( 15 ) .
This finding provides additional support for the idea that NadR forms a DNA loop within the nad operator .
In contrast , the pncB operator , which only has only one complete NAD box , did not display any hypersensitive sites .
In addition to locating the regions within nad operators that bind NadR , DNase - I-protection also provided a means for determining NadR - DNA binding constants in solution ( 3 ) .
Results presented in Fig. 6 indicate that the NadR/nadA - O apparent dissociation constant is 3 nM in solution ( in the presence of 660 M NAD ) .
In the absence of NAD , no protection of the nadA operator was observed , even at 4,000 nM NadR .
The apparent dissociation constant for NadR/pncB - O was 18 nM , reflecting a sixfold - lower affinity of this operator for NadR as predicted from earlier results ( 16 , 17 ) .
No evidence of cooperativity was observed .
Both NAD boxes were equally affected at the nadA operator upon dilution of the NadR preparation .
DISCUSSION The simplest working model for NadR function as supported by the available data is that NadR undergoes a reversible conformational shift between repressor and transport facilitator in response to NAD levels .
The in - vitro studies prove that , in the presence of NTPs , NAD is required for NadR to effectively bind appropriate operator DNA sequences .
Once in its repressor conformation , NadR will bind to an NAD box consisting of TGTTTA and its inverted repeat .
The nadA and nadB operators contain two NAD boxes overlapping potential 10 RNA polymerase binding sites ( box 1 ) and RBS ( box 2 ) .

The data are percent saturation of NadR bound to DNA based on the percent protection from DNase I cleavage ( midpoint of each curve approximates K d ( app ) ) .
Data points were generated by titrating His - tagged NadR on the nadA and pncB operators in solution and determining relative band intensities in protected and unprotected regions by using phosphor screen technology and autoradiograms .
DNA binding conditions were the same as described in the legend for Fig. 4 with the addition of NAD .

dimers would create an NadR tetramer and a DNA loop structure that sequesters the 10 RNA polymerase binding site .
The data also offer a possible explanation for the variable degrees of repression observed when the nadA and nadB genes ( 15 - to 30 - fold [ 16 ] ) are compared to the pncB gene ( 2 - to 4 - fold [ 17 ] ) .
DNA sequence analyses of these genes reveal that nadA and nadB each contain two complete NAD boxes , separated by 42 and 20 bp , respectively .
However , the pncB operator contains only one complete and one incomplete NAD box , separated by 24 bp .
The results shown in Fig. 5 suggest that in pncB , NadR binds only to the complete NAD box .
Thus , NadR would only weakly block RNA polymerase movement on pncB .
This is supported by the higher dissociation constant of NadR for pncB compared to nadA ( Fig. 6 ) .
NadR appears to be compartmentalized into several functional domains .
The repressor and transport activities are located within the amino - and carboxyl - terminal ends , respectively ( 9 ) .
The central region appears important for signaling the transition between the two proposed forms of this protein .
A consensus sequence diagnostic for mononucleotide binding sites ( GGESSGKSTL ) occurs within the central region of NadR ( position 237 [ 8 ] ) and may form part of the binding site for NTPs and/or NAD .
The classic dinucleotide binding site , Gly - X-Gly - XX - Gly , does not occur within NadR , nor is there significant sequence similarity to the NAD binding sites of ADP - ribosylating toxins ( 5 ) .
However , there is a family of NAD - dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases where NAD utilizes a consensus sequence , ( GLIVMFA ) E ( SILMTAC ) ( GS ) G ( KNLM ) ( SADN ) ( TAPFV ) , as part of its binding site ( GCG version 9.1 ; Motifs Software , Madison , Wis. ) ( 4 , 13 , 14 , 24 , 30 ) .
NadR may utilize a similar strategy since the sequence within NadR starting at amino - acid 238 matches this consensus ( GESSGKST ) and , in fact , overlaps the mononucleotide site noted above .
