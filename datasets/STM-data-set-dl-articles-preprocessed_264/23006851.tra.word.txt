In addition to metabolic functions , the ADI system has been implicated in the virulence of certain pathogens .
The pathogenic intracellular bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses the STM4467 , STM4466 , and STM4465 genes , which are predicted to encode ADI , CK , and OTC , respectively .
Here we report that the STM4467 gene encodes an ADI and that ADI activity plays a role in the successful infection of a mammalian host by S. Typhimurium .
An STM4467 deletion mutant was defective for replication inside murine macrophages and was attenuated for virulence in mice .
We determined that a regulatory protein encoded by the STM4463 gene functions as an activator for STM4467 expression .
The expression of the ADI pathway genes was enhanced inside macrophages in a process that required STM4463 .
Lack of STM4463 impaired the ability of S. Typhimurium to replicate within macrophages .
A mutant defective in STM4467 - encoded ADI displayed normal production of nitric - oxide by macrophages .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a facultatively intracellular bacterium that can cause a diverse spectrum of diseases .
In the course of systemic infection of a mammalian host , S. Typhimurium can survive within the macrophage phagosome ( 13 ) .
For this purpose , S. Typhimurium expresses gene products to avoid killing by microbicides that are produced inside the phagosome ( 25 , 39 ) .
Previous studies have also revealed that purine , pyrimidine , and amino - acid auxotrophs of S. Typhimurium are unable to survive inside macrophages ( 18 , 27 ) .
In addition , S. Typhimurium appears to activate an alternative metabolic pathway for the utilization of carbon sources during - growth inside macrophages ( 15 ) .
These findings demonstrate that bacterial metabolism is a crucial determinant for the successful pathogenesis of S. Typhimurium ( 7 , 32 ) .
In general , three enzymes -- arginine deiminase ( ADI ) , ornithine transcarbamoylase ( OTC ) , and carbamate kinase ( CK ) -- constitute the ADI system , which catalyzes the conversion of L - arginine into ornithine , ammonia , and carbon dioxide with the formation of ATP ( 44 ) .
This enzymatic pathway is widely distributed in various bacterial species and is known to provide cellular energy , particularly under oxygen - limited conditions ( 4 , 9 , 20 , 44 ) .
In addition to its metabolic function , the ADI system is also employed to protect some bacteria from stressful conditions .
In oral streptococci and Streptococcus pyogenes , the ADI system helps the bacteria resist acidity by generating ammonia and thus neutralizing an acidic pH ( 4 , 11 ) .
Moreover , the ADI system sometimes , though rarely , plays a role in bacterial pathogenesis .
ADI is necessary for S. pyogenes to invade and survive inside epithelial cells ( 11 ) .
Additionally , a lack of ADI has been found to impair the survival of Listeria monocytogenes in the spleen during infection in a mouse model ( 41 ) .
The STM4467 , STM4466 , and STM4465 genes of S. Typhimurium are predicted to encode ADI , CK , and OTC , respectively .
The ADI pathway of S. Typhimurium appears to be functional , because the expression of the putative ADI cluster increased OTC activity ( 43 ) .
In the present study , we investigated the role of the ADI system in S. Typhimurium pathogenesis .
We found that an S. Typhimurium strain lacking the STM4467 - encoded ADI was defective in its ability to replicate inside macrophages and was attenuated for virulence in mice .
We also revealed that the STM4463 - encoded regulator contributes to S. Typhimurium virulence , at least in part , by upregulating the expression of the ADI gene cluster within macrophages .

The PCR product was introduced between the HindIII and SphI restriction sites of pACYC184 ( 5 ) .
The sequences of the STM4467 and STM4463 coding regions on the recombinant plasmids were verified by nucleotide sequencing .
Determination of ADI activity .
The ADI activities of cell extracts were measured using a chemical colorimetric method based on the production of L - citrulline from L - arginine ( 3 ) .
A total of 50 ml of a bacterial culture grown in LB - medium was harvested , and the cell pellet was suspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris [ pH 8.0 ] containing 0.3 M NaCl ) and was disrupted by sonication .
After removal of the cellular debris by centrifugation , 0.4 ml of 10 mM L - arginine in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 7.2 ) was added to 1 ml of cell extract .
After a 60 - min incubation at 37 °C , 250 l of a 1:3 ( vol/vol ) mixture of 95 % sulfuric acid and 85 % phosphoric acid and 250 l of a 3 % diacetyl monooxime solution were added , and the mixtures were boiled for 15 min .
The development of an orange color was monitored at 490 nm .
- Galactosidase assays were performed in duplicate , and the activity was determined as described previously ( 36 ) .
The gentamicin protection assay was conducted as described previously ( 7 ) .
J774A .1 macrophage cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , penicillin ( 50 U/ml ) , and streptomycin ( 50 U/ml ) .
Prior to bacterial infection , a monolayer of 1 10 5 J774A .1 cells was prepared in a 24 - well tissue culture plate and was incubated in DMEM -- 10 % FBS without antibiotics at 37 °C for 1 h under 5 % CO 2 .
A bacterial culture grown to stationary - phase with aeration was applied to the cell monolayer at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 .
After 1hofincubation , the wells were washed three times with prewarmed phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) to remove extracellular bacteria and were then incubated for 1 h with the prewarmed medium supplemented with 100 g/ml of gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria .
Afterward , the wells were washed three times with PBS , lysed in 1 % Triton X - 100 for 30 min , and then diluted in PBS .
A dilution of the suspension was plated on LB agar medium to enumerate the CFU .
Bacterial cells grown overnight in LB - medium were pelleted , washed , and resuspended in PBS .
Eight - week - old C3H / HeN female mice were used to assess the virulence of S. Typhimurium strains .
Approximately 10 4 bacterial cells in 200 l of PBS were injected intraperitoneally into groups of mice ( 5 mice/group ) , and the survival of the mice was recorded over 3 weeks .
To analyze bacterial colonization in organs , the mice were sacrificed at 5 days after infection , and the spleens and livers were removed aseptically .
The organs were homogenized in 1 ml of ice - cold PBS and were serially diluted .
Bacterial loads were determined by plating the diluents on LB agar plates .
Determination of nitrite concentration .
J774A .1 macrophages were infected with bacteria as described above in triplicate .
The supernatants were harvested at 18 h after infection .
The nitrite concentration was measured using the Griess assay ( 21 ) .
Briefly , 50 l of culture supernatants was mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent ( Promega ) .
The absorbance was measured after 10 min at 550 nm in an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) microreader ( Sunrise Basic ; Tecan ) .
NaNO 2 was used to establish the standard nitrite concentration in the supernatants .
RNA isolation and qRT - PCR analysis .
For the extraction of RNA from S. Typhimurium growing inside J774A .1 macrophages , an infection experiment was conducted as described above except for the increased volume of macrophage cultures ( 50 ml in a 75 - cm 2 T - flask ) .
At 1 h , 6 h , and 18 h after infection , the macrophage monolayers were washed , lysed in 1 % Triton X - 100 , and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min to pellet the lysed macrophages .
From the supernatant that contained the intracellular bacteria , RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) .
The RNA samples were then treated with RNase - free DNase ( Ambion ) , and cDNA was synthesized using Omniscript reverse transcription reagents ( Qiagen ) and random hexamers ( Invitrogen ) .
The cDNA was quantified by using the 2 iQ SYBR green Supermix ( Bio - Rad ) , and real - time amplification of the PCR products was performed using the iCycler iQ realtime detection system ( Bio - Rad ) .
The calculated threshold cycle ( C T ) corresponding to a target gene was normalized to the C T of the control gene , rpoD .
The sigma factor gene rpoD was chosen as a control because no significant variation in rpoD expression was observed inside macrophages ( 17 ) .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The STM4467 gene encodes ADI in S. Typhimurium .
In the S. Typhimurium genome , the STM4467 , STM4466 , and STM4465 genes are clustered into an operon - like structure ( Fig. 1A ) and are predicted to encode enzymes of the ADI system : ADI , CK , and OTC , respectively ( Fig. 1A ) .
It has been reported that when Salmonella is grown in LB - medium containing 0.4 M NaCl without agitation , the expression of this gene cluster is induced to promote OTC activity ( 43 ) .
Although this finding suggests that the ADI pathway might be functional in S. Typhimurium , the genes responsible for the enzymatic activities of the ADI pathway have remained unknown .
Therefore , we compared the ADI activity of wild - type Salmonella with that of its isogenic STM4467 deletion mutant .
When the ADI activity assay was conducted using a cell extract prepared from the wild - type strain , an orange color developed ( Fig. 1B ) , which indicated the ADI - catalyzed production of citrulline from arginine ( 3 , 41 ) .
However , in the STM4467 deletion mutant , the enzyme activity was poorly detected ( Fig. 1B ) and was only 40 % of that present in the wild - type strain ( Fig. 1C ) .
Expression of the STM4467 gene from a plasmid enabled the STM4467 deletion mutant to produce citrulline at levels even higher than those of the wild - type strain ( Fig. 1B and C ) .
Thus , these results indicate that the STM4467 gene either encodes ADI or is required for full ADI activity .
The STM4467 gene contributes to Salmonella virulence .
ADI is necessary for S. pyogenes to invade and survive inside epithelial cells ( 11 ) .
Wild - type L. monocytogenes survived longer in the spleen during a mouse infection than did a mutant lacking ADI ( 41 ) .
These findings suggested a role for ADI in bacterial pathogenesis .
To explore whether the STM4467 - encoded ADI contributes to Salmonella virulence , we initially compared the replication abilities of the wild - type and STM4467 deletion strains within murine macrophages .
The gentamicin protection assay revealed that the CFU count of the STM4467 deletion mutant within the macro - FIG 1 The STM4467 gene is required for ADI activity .

FIG 2 The STM4467 gene contributes to S. Typhimurium virulence .
( A ) J774A .1 macrophage cells were infected with the wild - type ( WT ) strain ( 14028s ) , the STM4467 deletion mutant ( CH102 ) , or strain CH102 harboring the p4467 plasmid ( STM4467/p4467 ) .
The numbers of intracellular bacteria were determined at 1 and 18 h after infection by using the gentamicin protection assay .
Means and standard deviations from at least three independent experiments are shown .
Triple asterisks indicate that the numbers of bacteria were significantly different ( P 0.001 ) from those of the WT strain at 18 h postinfection ; ns , not significantly different .
( B ) Groups of C3H/HeN mice ( 5 mice/group ) were injected intraperitoneally with 10 4 cells of the WT or STM4467 deletion strain .
The survival of the mice was monitored daily for 3 weeks .
The results of one of two independent experiments ( P 0.001 ) , which yielded similar results , are shown .
The results of the other experiment are shown in Fig .
S1 in the supplemental material .
( C ) Groups of C3H/HeN mice ( 5 mice/group ) were infected with the WT strain , the STM4467 deletion mutant , or strain CH102 harboring plasmid p4467 as described for panel B .
At 5 days after infection , the numbers of bacteria in the liver and spleen were determined .
An asterisk indicates that the numbers of bacteria were significantly different ( P 0.05 ) from those of the WT strain .
phages at 18 h postinfection was only 30 % of that of the wild type ( Fig. 2A ) .
This result was not due to differences in the phagocytosis of the two strains , because the intracellular numbers of the two strains were similar at an earlier time point ( i.e. , 1 h ) after infection ( Fig. 2A ) .
The phenotypic defect of the STM4467 deletion strain was due to the absence of STM4467 function , as evidenced by the fact that expression of the STM4467 gene from a plasmid enabled the STM4467 deletion mutant to replicate within the macrophages at a level similar to that of the wild - type strain ( Fig. 2A ) .
To test whether the STM4467 deletion mutant might be attenuated for virulence in mice , we injected Salmonella intraperitoneally into groups of 5 mice .
As shown in Fig. 2B , all of the mice inoculated with the wild - type strain died within 10 days , whereas 90 % of the mice that received the STM4467 mutant survived over 3 weeks postinfection .
We further verified the virulence phenotype of the STM4467 deletion mutant by determining the numbers of bacterial cells in organs of mice .
In both the liver and the spleen , the numbers of STM4467 deletion mutant cells were 10 - fold lower than those of wild - type cells at 5 days postinfection ( Fig. 2C ) .
This phenotypic difference was due to the absence of STM4467 function , as evidenced by the fact that the STM4467 deletion strain carrying the STM4467 expression plasmid was able to colonize the liver and spleen as efficiently as the wild - type strain ( Fig. 2C ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that in the absence of the STM4467 - encoded ADI activity , S. Typhimurium can not avoid killing by macrophages and thus is attenuated for virulence .
Expression of the ADI pathway genes is enhanced inside macrophages .
The attenuation of the virulence of the STM4467 mutant suggested that expression of the STM4467 gene might increase when Salmonella cells are inside macrophages .
To test this hypothesis , we isolated RNA from wild - type Salmonella cells grown within macrophages and determined the transcription levels of genes via qRT - PCR .
We found that STM4467 transcription was enhanced in Salmonella cells growing inside macrophages : the STM4467 mRNA levels increased 4 - fold at 18 h over those at 1 h after bacterial entry into the macrophages ( Fig. 3A ) .
In agreement with the hypothesis that the ADI system genes constitute an operon that produces a polycistronic mRNA ( 2 , 22 ) , the transcript levels of the STM4466 and STM4465 genes , which putatively encode CK and OTC , respectively ( Fig. 1A ) , were also elevated at 18 h after phagocytosis ( Fig. 3A ) .
In response to environmental cues inside the phagosome , Salmonella expresses a series of genes from Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI - 2 ) , which mediates its survival within macrophages ( 7 , 24 , 29 , 31 ) .
Therefore , the induction of the SPI - 2 gene ssaG under our experimental conditions ( Fig. 3A ) reflects the possibility that upregulation of the ADI pathway could occur in response to environmental cues inside the phagosome .
Induction of the ADI pathway was observed only at 18 h after phagocytosis 4294 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity STM4467 Contributes to Salmonella Virulence FIG 3 Expression of the ADI system is enhanced inside macrophages in an STM4463 - dependent manner .
The transcription levels of the STM4467 , STM4466 , STM4465 , STM4463 , and ssaG genes in S. Typhimurium growing inside macrophages were determined via qRT - PCR .
J774A .1 macrophages were infected with the wild - type strain ( 14028s ) ( A ) or the STM4463 deletion strain ( CH201 ) ( B ) , and bacterial RNA was isolated at 1 h , 6 h , and 18 h after infection .
To obtain the relative mRNA expression values on the y axis , the mRNA levels of each gene were divided by those of the rpoD gene , which were further normalized by the transcription levels displayed at 1 h after infection .
Means and standard deviations from three independent experiments are shown .
Asterisks indicate significant differences ( ** , P 0.01 ; * , P 0.05 ) in mRNA levels between the 1 - h and 18 - h samples .
( Fig. 3A ) ; this timing was slower than that of SPI - 2 gene induction , which occurred at 6 h after bacterial entry into macrophages ( Fig. 3A ) ( 8 ) .
Thus , given that the environment within the Salmonellacontaining phagosome is dynamically changing , the expression of the ADI system might be important at a stage of infection later than the onset of expression of the SPI - 2 genes .
The STM4463 protein promotes the transcription of the STM4467 gene .
As in the structures of other known ADI operons ( 38 , 44 ) , the STM4463 gene encodes a transcriptional regulator downstream of the ADI gene cluster ( Fig. 1A ) .
This gene was formerly known as rosE , and the STM4463 protein was identified as a regulator that directly represses the expression of the std fimbrial operon ( 6 ) .
However , since homologs of STM4463 have been reported to regulate the expression of the ADI operon in other bacteria ( 12 , 33 , 34 ) , we reasoned that the STM4463 protein might act as a regulator of Salmonella ADI expression .
To examine STM4467 transcription , we constructed a strain that carried a transcriptional - fusion of lacZ to the STM4467 gene .
A - galactosidase assay determined that in the STM4467 - lacZ strain , the lack of STM4463 reduced STM4467 expression levels by 30 % ( Fig. 4 ) .
To further investigate the regulatory role of STM4463 , we constructed plasmid p4463 , in which expression of the STM4463 gene is under the control of the lac promoter .
The - galactosidase assay revealed that in the STM4467 - lacZ strain lacking the STM4463 gene and harboring p4463 , STM4467 transcription was restored FIG 4 The STM4463 protein promotes transcription of the STM4467 gene .
Transcription levels of the STM4467 gene were determined using a - galactosidase assay on S. Typhimurium strains carrying an STM4467 - lacZ fusion .
Strain CH110 ( wild type [ WT ] ) , its isogenic STM4463 deletion mutant ( CH111 STM4463 ) , and strain CH111 harboring plasmid p4463 ( STM4463/p4463 ) were grown in LB - medium with ( ) or without ( ) 0.5 mM IPTG .
Means and standard deviations from three independent experiments are shown .
Asterisks indicate that the - galactosidase levels of bacteria are significantly different ( *** , P 0.001 ; ** , P 0.01 ) from those of the wild - type strain .
to wild - type levels , which further increased 5 - fold when the strain was grown with IPTG to induce STM4463 ( Fig. 4 ) .
Salmonella ADI activity was also enhanced by STM4463 in a process that required STM4467 : the overexpression of STM4463 increased ADI activity 5 - fold in the wild - type strain but failed to do so for the STM4467 deletion mutant ( Fig. 1B and C ) .
Cumulatively , these results suggest that the STM4463 protein is a regulator that positively controls the ADI pathway of S. Typhimurium .
The STM4463 regulator is necessary for Salmonella to express the ADI gene cluster and replicate inside macrophages .
Since the STM4463 protein appeared to enhance ADI expression ( Fig. 4 ) , we reasoned that the STM4463 regulator might be responsible for intramacrophage induction of the ADI system .
To test this possibility , we examined the transcription of the STM4467 , STM4466 , and STM4465 genes within macrophages .
qRT - PCR analysis revealed that in contrast to the wild - type strain , the STM4463 deletion mutant failed to induce the expression of these three genes at 18 h after phagocytosis ( Fig. 3B ) .
The failure of the STM4463 mutant to induce the ADI gene cluster is not due to a general expression defect , because the intraphagosomal induction of the SPI - 2 gene ssaG was unaffected by the STM4463 deletion ( Fig. 3B ) .
We then hypothesized that the STM4463 regulator could contribute to Salmonella virulence by activating ADI expression within macrophages .
Indeed , a lack of STM4463 impaired the ability of Salmonella bacteria to replicate inside macrophages .
The numbers of intracellular Salmonella bacteria with the STM4463 deletion were 3 - fold lower than those of wild - type bacteria at 18 h after phagocytosis ( Fig. 5 ) .
This defective phenotype was due to the function of STM4463 , as evidenced by the fact that the replication ability of the STM4463 deletion mutant was recovered by expression of the STM4463 gene from a plasmid ( Fig. 5 ) .
The numbers of bacteria of the wild - type strain and the STM4463 deletion strain inside the macrophages were similar at 1 h after infection , indicating that the STM4463 regulator did not interfere with phagocytosis .

FIG 5 The STM4463 regulator is necessary for S. Typhimurium replication inside macrophages .
J774A .1 macrophages were infected with the wild - type ( WT ) strain ( 14028s ) , an STM4463 mutant ( CH201 ) , or strain CH201 carrying plasmid pPM4463 ( STM4463/pPM4463 ) .
The numbers of intracellular bacteria were determined at 1 h and 18 h after infection .
Means and standard deviations from at least three independent experiments are shown .
Asterisks indicate that the numbers of bacteria are significantly different ( ** , P 0.01 ) from those of the WT strain at 18 h postinfection ; ns , not significantly different .
In the wild - type strain , transcription levels of the STM4463 gene increased 2 - fold at 18 h after phagocytosis ( Fig. 3A ) , concurrently with ADI pathway induction ( Fig. 3A ) .
In addition , induction of the STM4463 regulator greatly increased the expression of the STM4467 gene ( Fig. 4 ) .
Therefore , although the precise mechanism of control of STM4463 expression within macrophages is presently unclear , we propose that levels of the STM4463 regulator are enhanced by unknown signals present inside the phagosome and , in turn , activate expression of the ADI system .
It is possible that the failure of expression of the ADI gene cluster partially contributes to the defective survival of the STM4463 mutant within macrophages .
The STM4463 regulator repressed the expression of the fimbrial operon std , which appeared necessary for full Salmonella virulence in mice ( 6 ) .
However , because the effects of STM4463 and std mutations on Salmonella virulence were assessed by bacterial colonization of organs of mice that were infected via an oral route ( 6 ) , it remains unknown whether STM4463 regulation of the std operon could affect the survival of Salmonella inside macrophages .
STM4467 does not affect the levels of nitric - oxide production inside macrophages .
After phagocytosis , bacterial cells are killed inside the phagosome by the actions of microbicidal products ( 19 , 23 ) .
Of these antimicrobials , nitric - oxide ( NO ) is synthesized from arginine by NO synthase ( NOS ) , and the availability of arginine is one of the rate - limiting factors in cellular NO production ( 1 , 16 , 37 ) .
S. Typhimurium appears to have a means to control host arginine metabolism by which it can avoid NO toxicity .
A recent study demonstrated that in Salmonella - infected macrophages , the upregulation of arginase II quenches arginine and reduces NO production ( 30 ) .
On the basis of these observations , we hypothesized that the enhanced ADI activity within the phagosome might reduce NO levels by consuming arginine , thus helping Salmonella to avoid NO - mediated killing by macrophages .
To test this hypothesis , we measured NO levels within macrophages with or without Salmonella infection .
The results indicated that infection by wild - type Salmonella dramatically increased the NO levels in macrophages ( Fig. 6 ) , in accordance with the observation that NOS activity is inducible upon bacterial infection ( 26 ) .
We found FIG 6 The STM4467 - encoded ADI has no effect on NO 2 generation by macrophages .
J774A .1 macrophage cells were infected with the wild - type ( WT ) strain ( 14028s ) , an STM4467 deletion mutant ( CH102 STM4467 ) , or strain CH102 harboring plasmid p4467 ( STM4467/p4467 ) .
At 18 h after infection , levels of NO 2 production in the supernatants of macrophages were determined by using the Griess reaction .
Note that NO 2 was nearly absent from macrophages without ( ) S. Typhimurium infection .
Means and standard deviations from three independent experiments are shown .
`` ns '' indicates that the nitrite levels of bacteria are not significantly different from those of the WT strain .
that the levels of NO production stimulated by Salmonella bacteria with the STM4467 deletion were comparable to those occurring upon infection with the wild - type strain ( Fig. 6 ) .
Therefore , this result suggests that the STM4467 - encoded ADI activity contributes to the intramacrophage survival of Salmonella via an alternative mechanism that is unrelated to NO production .
In the present study , we established that the ADI pathway contributes to Salmonella pathogenesis .
The ADI gene cluster was induced inside macrophages in a process that required the STM4463 regulator , the lack of which impaired the ability of Salmonella to replicate inside macrophages .
To our knowledge , this is the first report to demonstrate the regulation of the ADI genes and their role in a pathogen growing inside host cells .
Our findings raise important questions .
First , how do levels of the STM4463 regulator increase within macrophages ?
Since the STM4463 gene appears to have its own promoter , an unknown trans - acting factor might act on the STM4463 regulatory region in response to environmental cues within the phagosome .
Second , how does the ADI pathway contribute to Salmonella virulence ?
We were able to exclude the possibility that the ADI pathway reduced NO toxicity .
In L. monocytogenes and S. pyogenes , ADI enzymes appeared to protect bacteria from acidic stress ( 4 , 11 , 43 ) .
Since Salmonella experiences an acidic pH within the phagosome ( 13 , 40 ) , we tested whether the ADI pathway is also implicated in the survival of Salmonella at acidic pHs .
However , we found that the STM4467 deletion did not inhibit the growth of Salmonella at pH 5.5 ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , as proposed in a recent study ( 43 ) , the ADI system might provide energy for intracellular Salmonella bacteria by producing ATP or might protect it from oxidative stress within the phagosome via production of the polyamine putrescine .
