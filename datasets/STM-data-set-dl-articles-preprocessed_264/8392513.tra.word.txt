175 , No. 14 A PhoP - Repressed Gene Promotes Salmonella typhimurium Invasion of Epithelial Cells IRMGARD BEHLAU AND SAMUEL I. MILLER * Infectious Disease Unit , Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02114 The Salmonella typhimurium transcriptional regulators , PhoP/PhoQ , induce phoP - activated gene ( pag ) expression to promote virulence and intracellular survival within macrophages .
This response to the macrophage intracellular environment is simulated by phoPlphoQ constitutive mutations ( phenotype PhoPr ) that increase the expression of pag genes and repress the synthesis of approximately 20 proteins encoded by phoP - repressed genes ( prg genes ) ( S. I. Miller and J. J. Mekalanos , J. Bacteriol .
PhoPc bacteria are attenuated for mouse virulence , suggesting that prg genes are virulence genes .
We now report the identification of five unlinked prg loci by use of the transposon TnphoA .
In general , medium conditions ( i.e. , starvation ) that activate pag expression repress prg expression .
However , variable effects on the PhoP regulon were observed when bacteria were grown under different oxygen tensions ( pag andpMg genes ) or exposed to low pH ( prg genes ) , suggesting heterogenous control of the regulon .
One prg locus , prgH , was demonstrated to contribute to mouse virulence by both the oral and the intraperitoneal routes .
prgH was located at 59 min on the Salmonella chromosome , a region where other genes essential to invasion of epithelial cells are clustered .
TheprgH locus was highly linked to one invasion locus , hi ( C. A. Lee , B. D. Jones , and S. Falkow , Proc .
USA 89:1847 - 1851 , 1992 ) , although transcription ofprgH was opposite that of the Tn5B50 - encoded promoters that result in a hyperinvasive or hil phenotype .
Both PrgH and PhoP ' mutant S. typhimurium were found to be defective in induction of endocytosis by Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) epithelial cells .
The invasion defect of PrgH but not that of PhoP ' mutant bacteria was complemented by plasmids containing prgH ( hil ) DNA .
Therefore , two virulence properties of Salnonella species , induction of endocytosis by epithelial cells and survival within macrophages , are oppositely modulated by the PhoP/PhoQ virulence regulators .
Salmonella species cause a spectrum of diseases , including gastroenteritis , enteric fever , and septicemia ( 15 ) .
After oral ingestion , Salmonella typhimurium crosses the small intestinal mucosa and disseminates to colonize the spleens , livers , and bone marrow of mice ( 6 ) .
The exposure of Salmonella species to these different extracellular ( stomach , intestine , lymphatic system , and bloodstream ) and intracellular ( epithelial cell , polymorphonuclear leukocyte , and monocyte - macrophage ) environments should expose the bacterium to varied pH and oxygen tensions and other complex environments .
These environments stimulate the bacterium to express genes that encode proteins which facilitate coexistence .
Such virulence - factors in a wide number of gram - positive and - negative bacteria are controlled by environmentally responsive regulators ( 26 , 29 ) .
In S. typhimurium , one such regulon is modulated by the PhoP ( transcriptional activator ) and PhoQ ( sensor kinase ) proteins , which are essential to S. typhimurium pathogenesis and survival within macrophages ( 9 , 32 ) .
PhoP/PhoQ are similar to other known two - component systems in which signal transduction is accomplished by a phosphotransferase mechanism ( 14 , 31 , 32 ) .
Previously reported phenotypes of phoP and phoQ mutants include attenuated mouse virulence , decreased survival within macrophages , and sensitivity to low pH and defensins ( 9 , 10 , 32 - 34 ) .
A number of loci that require an intact phoP locus for transcriptional activation have been defined previously ( 14 , 31 , 32 ) .
The transcription of phoP - activated genes ( pag genes ) is induced when * 4475 Salmonella species are within acidified macrophage but not epithelial cell phagosomes ( 3 ) .
The induction of pagC transcription results in the synthesis of an 18 - kDa envelope protein that promotes virulence and survival within macrophages ( 32 , 37 ) but is not required for epithelial cell invasion ( 35 ) .
Therefore , the regulation and virulence function ofpag genes may be limited to survival within macrophages ( 31 ) .
Constitutive mutations in the phoP locus ( phenotype PhoPc ) that result in increased expression ofpag genes in an unregulated fashion also markedly attenuate S. typhimurium virulence and survival within macrophages ( 33 ) .
The virulence defect of PhoPc strains may be explained by their decreased expression of approximately 20 polypeptides encoded byphoP - repressed genes ( prg genes ) ( 33 ) .
prg loci are expected to be repressed when Salmonella species are within acidified macrophage phagosomes ( pH < 5.0 ) and maximally expressed in environments where pag genes are repressed .
Therefore , we undertook to identify phoP - repressed loci to further define the virulence defect of PhoPc strains and to identify new genes essential to Salmonella pathogenesis .

chromogenic substrate BCIP ( 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolylphosphate [ p - toluidine salt ] ) was used to detect phosphatase activity on agar at a final concentration of 40 , ug/ml .
p - Nitrophenyl phosphate was used as a substrate for quantitative measurement of alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) activity .
Media were buffered to various pH ranges with 1 M sodium citrate .
E medium ( Vogel - Bonner minimal ) was prepared as described previously ( 7 ) .
Nitrogen - , carbon - , and phosphatefree medium ( N - C-P - ) was prepared as described by Kier et al. ( 17 ) .
This starvation medium was supplemented with 0.04 % ( wt/vol ) glucose as the carbon source , 10 mM NH4C1 as the nitrogen source , and 1 mM NaH2PO4 .
H20 as the phosphate source .
The carbon concentration is 1 log less than that described by Kier et al. ( 17 ) and was likely the most growth limiting .
Measurement of AP activities .
AP activities of strains which were isogenic except for mutations in the phoP locus were measured in cultures grown from a single - colony inoculum under various oxygen tensions with or without shaking at 37 °C .
Anaerobic cultures were grown in an anaerobic chamber ( Coy Laboratory Products , Inc. ) with a gas mixture of 80 % N2 , 10 % 02 , and 10 % CO2 at 37 °C .
For acid regulation , aliquots of mid - logarithmic cultures were removed to measure initial pH and AP activity .
Sodium citrate ( 1 M ; pH > 6.0 ) or citric acid ( 1 M ; pH 4.7 ) was added to equivalent amounts of culture to a final concentration of 50 mM citrate .
Cultures were grown aerobically for 2 h at 37 °C , and then pH and AP measurements were taken .
AP activity was measured as described previously ( 27 ) .
AP units were calculated by the following formula : units = -LCB- OD420 / [ time ( minutes ) x volume x OD600 ] -RCB- x 1,000 as defined by Miller for 3 - galactosidase ( 30 ) , where OD420 and OD6 .
are the optical densities at 420 and 600 nm , respectively .
Bacteriophage P22HTint - mediated transduction was performed as described previously ( 7 ) .
TnphoA mutagenesis was performed with a broad - hostrange plasmid ( pRT291 ) to deliver TnphoA ( 49 ) .
Transpositions of TnphoA into Salmonella DNA were identified by use of the incompatibility plasmid pPH1JI ( 49 ) .
Screening for phoP - repressed genes was performed with CS031 , the donor strain of the pho - 24 allele .
CS031 was constructed by a P22 bacteriophage transductional cross between strains AD154 and CS022 , which contain the purB : : TnlO allele and the pho - 24 allele , respectively .
The linkage of pho - 24 and purB : : TnlO was - 70 % , similar to the linkage ofpurB to other phoP alleles .
Therefore , when P22 bacteriophage transductional crosses were performed between CS031 and the strains containing active gene fusions to phoA , strains could be screened for loss of fusion protein activity upon acquisition of tetracycline resistance .
The initial screening involved detection of a loss of AP activity in approximately 70 % of colonies that acquired tetracycline resistance , as they were presumed to contain the pho - 24 allele .
In addition , controls were performed with strain AD154 , which contains the samepurB : : TnlO allele linked to a phoP null allele , phoP12 .
Plasmid DNA was transformed into S. typhimurium LB5010 by the calcium chloride and heat - shock procedures ( 24 ) .
Linkage analysis of phoP - repressed genes .
The chromosomal location of TnphoA insertions in phoP - repressed genes ( prg : : TnphoA ) was determined by linkage analysis to a bank of strains with TnlOA16A17 insertions ( 19 ) .
Cells with TnphoA insertions were spread on LB agar plates containing 10 pg of tetracycline per ml and 40 , g of BCIP per ml .
Then P22 lysates grown on strains with TnJOA16A17 insertions were spotted onto plates with a multiprong inoculator .
After being inoculated overnight , plates were reviewed for linkage by looking for mixed blue - and - white colonies .
Linkage was confirmed and quantitated by carrying out individual transductional crosses between the strains containing TnJOA16A17 and the strain with the TnphoA insertion .
After selection for the TnlOA16A17 - encoded tetracycline resistance , strains were scored for a loss of blue color and TnphoA - encoded kanamycin resistance .
Some TnphoA strains were found to be linked to TnJOA16A17 strains with no known map location .
Two of these TnJOA16A17 insertions were physically mapped by Liu and Sanderson by pulsed - field gel electrophoresis following XbaI restriction endonuclease digestion ( 23 ) .
On the basis of physical mapping , linkage analysis to other transposon insertions by P22 bacteriophage transduction was determined as necessary .
Chromosomal DNA was prepared as described by Mekalanos with proteinase K instead of pronase 4478 BEHLAU AND MILLER ( 25 ) .
Purification of plasmid DNA was performed by standard methods ( 40 ) .
Restriction endonuclease digestion was performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs ) .
DNA , size fractionated in agarose gels , was transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes ( New England Nuclear/Dupont , Boston , Mass. ) for blot hybridization by the method of Southern ( 44 ) .
DNA probes were purified from agarose gels by the freeze - squeeze method ( 48 ) and radiolabelled with [ 32P ] dCTP by the random primer method ( 8 ) .
Sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) was performed by the method of Laemmli ( 20 ) .
Acid sensitivity was tested by the method of Foster and Hall ( 10 ) .
Strains were grown aerobically in E medium - 0.4 % glucose at 370C to an OD6o0 of 0.5 .
The pH of the bacterial culture was decreased to nearly 3.3 by the addition of 1 M hydrochloric acid .
An aliquot was taken immediately ; the remainder of the culture was incubated further at 370C , with subsequent aliquots removed at 40 - and 80 - min time points .
The pH of the cultures remained near 3.3 .
The aliquots were diluted 1:10 in cold phosphatebuffered saline ( PBS ) , washed , and resuspended in normal saline prior to serial dilutions being plated for CFU .
Growth of tissue culture cells .
J774 .2 macrophages were cultured in Dulbecco 's minimal essential medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( DMEM - 10 % FBS ) as previously described ( 11 , 38 , 47 ) .
Cultured bone marrow macrophages were harvested from BALB/c mice purchased from the Charles River Breeding Laboratories ( Wilmington , Mass. ) and cultured as described previously ( 46 ) .
Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) epithelial cells were used between passages 40 to 58 to maximize bacterial adherence and invasion ( 21 ) .
Epithelial cell lines were cultured in DMEM - 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin solution at 370C in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere as described previously ( 11 , 38 , 47 ) .
Bacterial survival within macrophages .
Experiments were performed as previously described ( 5 ) .
Bacteria grown to stationary - phase were opsonized for 30 min in normal mouse serum before being exposed to cultured bone marrowderived macrophages harvested from BALB/c mice .
One hour after infection , gentamicin ( 10 , ug/ml ) was added to kill extracellular bacteria .
Procedures at all time points ( 1 , 4 , and 24 h ) were done in triplicate and were repeated on three separate occasions .
Bacterial adherence and uptake by epithelial cells .
Bacterial strains were grown at 37 °C without shaking ( microaerophilic conditions ) to a final density of approximately 2 x 108 CFU/ml .
Assays were performed by seeding 105 MDCK cells per well in 24 - well tissue culture plates .
Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5 % C02 - 95 % air atmosphere in DMEM - 10 % FBS without antibiotics until they were > 80 % confluent .
The adherence and invasion assays are modified versions of the protocol of Lee and Falkow ( 21 ) .
The confluent MDCK monolayers were washed three times with PBS , and then 0.9 ml of cold DMEM - 10 % FBS was added to each well .
Bacteria were washed in LB broth and resuspended in an equivalent volume of DMEM - 10 % FBS .
Approximately 5 x 107 bacteria per well was added .
The plates were spun at 500 rpm in a Sorvall RT6000B at 4 °C for 10 min and then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min .
Adherent bacteria were recovered by washing the plates three times with PBS , lysing the epithelial cells in 0.5 ml of 1 % Triton X - 100 - PBS , and plating for CFU/ml on LB agar .
A morphologic assessment of adherence was also performed by staining bacterially infected epithelial cell monolayers grown J. BACTERIOL .
overnight on coverslips for 7 min in 1 , ug of 4 ' ,6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole .
These 4 ' ,6 - diamidino - 2-phenylindole - stained coverslips were examined by both fluorescence and phasecontrast microscopy with a Leitz Laborlux 12 microscope .
Invasion or bacterium - mediated endocytosis ( BME ) was assessed by allowing bacteria to adhere as described above .
Plates containing bacteria and epithelial cells were incubated for 2 h at 370C in a 5 % C02 - 95 % air atmosphere .
Each well was washed three times with PBS to remove non - cellassociated bacteria .
DMEM - 10 % FBS supplemented with 10 pug of gentamicin per ml was then added to kill extracellular bacteria ( 50 ) .
After 90 min of incubation , the cell monolayers were washed three times with PBS and the viable intracellular bacteria were released by vigorous pipetting with 0.5 ml of 1 % Triton X - 100 - PBS .
Viable bacteria were quantitated by plating for CFU/ml on LB agar medium .
All assays were done in triplicate and were repeated on at least three different occasions .
SM7 , an invasion - deficient Salmonella enteritidis mutant , and CDC5 , an invasive clinical wild - type isolate of S. enteritidis ( gifts from V. Miller ) , were used as controls for BME ( 45 ) .
NP - 1 defensin was purified from rabbit peritoneal neutrophils ( gift from M. Selsted ) as described previously ( 42 , 43 ) .
Typically , 105 bacteria in 0.5 % tryptone in a 100 - pl volume ( 9 , 43 ) was exposed to 50 to 100 pug of defensin per ml at 370C for 2 h .
The reactions were stopped by diluting the reaction mixture with 0.9 % NaCl ( 43 ) .
Appropriate dilutions were plated to determine the CFU of surviving bacteria per ml .
Assays were performed in duplicate at least twice for each strain .
Appropriate assays with sensitive ( PhoP - ) and resistant ( wild - type ) strains were performed as controls .
Bacteria were grown aerobically at 37 °C to stationary - phase , washed with LB broth , and diluted in normal saline .
Thirty - five - day - old ( 16 - to 18 - g ) female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Charles River Breeding Laboratories , Inc. .
Diluted bacterial samples in saline were injected intraperitoneally with an inoculum of 0.1 to 0.15 ml .
Bacteria were administered orally as a 0.5 - ml bolus to mice that had fasted for 2 h via a 2 - in .
( ca. 5.1 - cm ) straight , 18 - gauge , stainless - steel animal oral feeding needle ( Harvard Apparatus , Inc. , South Natick , Mass. ) under mild 2 - bromo - 2-chloro - 1,1,1 - trifluoroethane ( Halothane ) anesthesia .

RESULTS Isolation of strains with TnphoA insertions in phoP - repressed genes .
phoP - repressed genes were expected to be highly expressed in strains deleted forphoP/phoQ and grown in pag - repressing conditions ( rich - medium ) .
A PhoP - PhoN - strain ( IB001 ) was constructed by a P22 transductional cross between CS019 and CS003 .
IB001 was chosen for TnphoA mutagenesis so that background acid phosphatase , encoded by phoN , would not interfere with the measurement of fusion protein activity upon alteration of the phoP locus .
A total of 1,800 individual blue colonies with PhoA fusion protein activity were isolated on LB agar plates containing BCIP .
These colonies were the product of 18 separate matings , with approximately 20 pools in each .
These strains were tested for reduction of fusion protein activity upon acquisition of the pho - 24 allele ( CS031 ) , which resulted in a PhoPc phenotype .
AP assays were then performed on strains which were isogenic except for the phoP locus ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The PhoPc phenotype was confirmed in these strains by preparation of whole - cell protein extracts and SDS - PAGE analysis .
All strains with a PhoPc phenotype demonstrated the expected distinctive pattern of protein expression in PhoP ' strains , i.e. , repressed protein species of specific sizes ( data not shown ) ( 33 ) .
Eight strains with gene fusions to phoP - repressed genes were identified .
As shown in Table 2 , the synthesis of most prg : : TnphoA fusion proteins was fully repressed by the pho - 24 allele ; however , some were only partially repressed .
Of note , values for prgB - phoA fusions in strains with a wild - type phoP locus ( Table 3 ) lower than those in PhoPstrains ( Table 2 ) may represent some degree of repression in the presence of PhoP .
Chromosomal location of pM - : : TinphoA loci .
prg : : TnphoA linkage analysis was performed with a bank of strains with randomly spaced TnJOA16A17 insertions ( 19 ) to determine chromosomal locations and whether prg : : TnphoA alleles were unlinked loci .
Theprg : : TnphoA insertions were in five distinct linkage groups .
Three alleles , prgEl - 3 : : TnphoA , were identically linked to the TnJOA16A17 insertion of AK3091 ( 26 % ) , and two other alleles , prgBl - 2 : : TnphoA , were similarly linked to the TnJOA16A17 insertions of AK3190 ( 94 % ) , AK3249 ( 89 % ) , and AK3186 ( 50 % ) .
Another allele , prgHl : : TnphoA , was found to be 37 % linked to the TnJOA16A17 insertion of strain AK3304 .
The other two prg alleles did not demonstrate linkage to the bank of strains PhoP REGULATION OF SALMONELLA INVASION 4479 tested .
The chromosomal DNA of these two strains was analyzed by Southern hybridization analysis with a portion of TnphoA as a probe , and a rough physical map of the sites located adjacent to the TnphoA insertion was determined .
These alleles , prgA and prgC , had different restriction endonuclease sites surrounding the TnphoA insertions ( data not shown ) .
In addition , the repression of prgA and prgC fusion protein activity in strains with the pho - 24 mutation was different ; prgC was completely repressed , while prgA was only partially repressed .
These data suggested that these loci are different .
Therefore , we identified five unlinked loci encoding envelope proteins repressed in the PhoPc phenotype .
Although three prg loci that were linked to transposon insertions were identified , none of the TnJOA16A17 insertions had a known map location .
The physical map locations of two of these transposon insertions , AK3249 and AK3304 , were graciously analyzed by S. Liu and K. Sanderson by use of XbaI restriction endonuclease digestion and pulsed - field gel electrophoresis .
Since TnJOA16A17 contains a single XbaI site , these TnJOA16A17 insertions can be assigned to a specific XbaI fragment with a known map location ( 23 ) .
AK3249 was assigned to 28 to 32 min , while AK3304 was assigned to either end of the 58 - to 70 - min fragment .
Further P22 transduction to known markers in those regions was performed .
The TnJOA16A17 insertion of strain AK3249 and prgB1 : : TnphoA were found not to be linked to the TnlO insertion of strain TN3061 ( 6 % linked to dcp ) , which has a transposon insertion at 28 min , or to the ompD : : TnS insertion of strain SH7782 at 32 min .
Therefore , we are unable to assign a map location more definite than the 28 - to 32 - min region .
prgHl : : TniphoA was found to be very weakly linked to the srl202 : : TnlO insertion of strain TT520 ( < 0.1 % ) at 59 min .
Therefore , pig genes are widely located and unlinked on the Salmonella chromosome , consistent with the function of PhoP/PhoQ as global regulators .
Environmental regulation ofprg loci .
Since PhoP/PhoQ are environmentally responsive regulators , the effects of different growth - conditions on prg : : TnphoA expression were tested .
The growth - rate of strains with prg : : TnphoA insertions was comparable to that of wild - type organisms under all conditions ( data not shown ) .
The expression of allprg loci was maximal in late logarithmic growth phase , when bacteria were grown in rich ( LB ) medium ( data not shown ) .
An example of this is the comparison of values of prgH : : TnphoA expression in Table 3 .
Since the expression ofpag loci was maximal in starvation conditions ( which only reaches a maximal OD6w of 0.5 ) and stationary - growth phase , this was consistent with a reciprocal relationship between the expression of pag and prg genes .
Further analysis ofprg locus expression under starvation conditions confirmed this reciprocal relationship ( Table 3 ) .
prgH expression was repressed ( Table 3 ) and other pig genes were minimally affected under starvation conditions ( data not shown ) , in contrast to the induction ofpag expression when bacteria were starved ( Table 3 ) ( 16 ) .
The effects of oxygen tension in rich - medium on pag and prg expression were also tested ( Table 3 ) , as these have recently been defined as an important signal for BME ( 21 ) .
Interestingly , different but not reciprocal regulation of pag and prg loci was found upon growth at different oxygen tensions .
Although pagA and pagB loci were minimally affected by growth at different oxygen tensions ( data not shown ) , the pagC virulence locus was approximately fivefold repressed when bacteria were grown anaerobically rather than aerobically ( Table 3 ) .

`` The effect of starvation onpig andpag expression .
Starvation medium ( N - C-P - ) ( 17 ) contained 0.04 % glucose , 10 mM NH4Cl , and 1 mM NaH2PO4 .
The fusion protein activity for starvation medium was measured after 48 h of growth ( OD6w = 0.5 ) , while that in rich - medium ( LB ) was measured in late - logarithmic - growth phase ( OD6w = 1.0 ) .
All cultures were grown aerobically .
c The effect of oxygen tension on expression of phoP - activated and phoP - repressed genes .
Expression in rich - medium under aerobic conditions at stationary phase ( OD6w > 1.4 ) and microaerophilic ( OD6 , = 0.8 ) and strict anaerobic conditions with 80 % N2 - 10 % 02 - 10 % CO2 ( OD6w = 0.6 ) after 24 h of growth is compared .
d The effect of pH on the expression of fusion protein activity ofpag andpag loci .
Expression was measured from cultures grown to logarithmic phase ( OD6W = 0.5 ) in LB - medium buffered to various pHs with sodium citrate .
was also noted in the expression of prg loci in response to growth - conditions in the absence - of - oxygen .
One locus , prgH , was repressed 3 - fold in anaerobic - growth , while another locus , prgB , was induced almost 50 - fold when grown anaerobically ( Table 3 ) .
Other prg loci had minimal changes in fusion protein expression as a result of different oxygen tensions in the growth media ( data not shown ) .
Low pH conditions also had a variable effect on pig expression ( Table 3 ) .
The expression ofpagC fusion protein activity was induced under acid conditions , as previously known ( 3 , 33 ) .
When bacteria were grown to mid - logarithmic phase , no significant induction of the relative repression of prgH expression was noted in media of low pH , while prgB expression was induced upon exposure of bacteria to low pH ( Table 3 ) .
Hence , loci maximally expressed under diverse environmental conditions can all be repressed by the PhoPc phenotype .
prgH is a virulence locus for S. typhimurium .
Since the PhoPc phenotype resulted in virulence attenuation and repressed the synthesis of approximately 20 proteins , we wished to test the virulence of strains with single mutations in pig loci ( Table 4 ) .
Strains with prg : : TnphoA insertions were screened for virulence defects by intraperitoneal injection of approximately 150 organisms into BALB/c mice .
Control experiments were also performed with wild - type bacteria .
When strains containing theprgHl : : TnphoA insertion were injected into mice intraperitoneally , it took signif - TABLE 4 .

More extensive testing of the LD50s of strains containing prgH mutations was performed .
prgH mutants were determined to have an LD50 of approximately 60 organisms , compared with a value of < 10 for wild - type bacteria .
Because of the difficulty of accurately delivering organisms in small doses to mice , we constructed a strain with a mutation in both prgH and phoP .
The PrgH - PhoPstrain had a greater than 10 - fold increase in LD50 compared with that for CS015 , an isogenic PhoP - strain ( Table 4 ) .
This additive effect further documented that the prgHl : : TnphoA mutation attenuated S. typhimurum virulence .
This also indicated that mutations which affected two phases of PhoP / PhoQ - regulated gene expression were additive in their effects on virulence .
Strains with prgHl : : TnphoA insertions were also tested for virulence when administered by the oral route .
A 10 - fold decrease in virulence ( increase in LD5O ) was observed ( Table 4 ) .
Further analysis of the efficiencies of strains with prgHl : : TnphoA insertions in crossing the mucosal barrier was by competition experiments with wild - type bacteria .
During the first 72 h after oral inoculation , prgHl : : TnphoA mutants were never found in the bloodstream of mice , while wild - type organisms always were ( data not shown ) .
Other strains with prg mutations were also tested for virulence defects by the oral route , but none were dramatically changed in virulence ( data not shown ) .
Mutations in oxygen - induced genes do not affect mouse virulence .
The findings that both prgH and pagC loci were repressed by anaerobic - growth and required for full virulence suggested that a shift from anaerobic to aerobic conditions might serve as a general signal for virulence gene induction .
Therefore , we constructed strains with mutations in loci previously described as induced by oxygen ( 2 ) .
ATCC 14028s derivatives with oxiA , axiC , and oxiE mutations were constructed ( CS032 , CS033 , and CS034 ) , and they had virulence similar to that of wild - type bacteria ( data not shown ) .
Although these gene fusions could still mark operons containing virulence genes , these data suggest that these loci are not essential to full virulence and that oxygen induction is not always correlated with virulence function .
prgH mutants have normal survival within macrophages .
175 , 1993 Since the PhoPc phenotype resulted in a defect in bacterial survival within macrophages , we tested whether this defect was due to a lack of synthesis of aprgH - encoded protein .
A strain with the prgHl : : TnphoA insertion , was tested for intracellular survival within bone marrow - derived macrophages from BALB/c mice and J774 .2 cells , a macrophagederived cell line .
No defect in intracellular survival was observed ( data not shown ) , indicating either that this assay was insensitive to defects in intracellular survival that result in modest mouse virulence defects or that prgH functions in a different site to promote virulence .
A strain with a prgBl : : TnphoA insertion was also tested and found not to have a defect in survival within macrophages ( data not shown ) .
prg : : TnphoA insertions do not suppress the phenotypes of PhoP mutants .
Several phenotypes ofphoP mutants , including defensin and acid sensitivities as well as mouse virulence attenuation , were tested for suppression upon the addition of a prg : : TnphoA mutation .
It was reasoned that some of the effect of a phoP mutation could be due to an inability to suppress the synthesis of pig products .
Therefore , PhoP mutant strains which were isogenic except for prg : : TnphoA mutations were constructed and tested for mouse virulence , for which suppression would involve an increase in virulence , or decreased acid and defensin sensitivities .
However , pig : : TnphoA insertions had no effect on the virulence phenotypes of PhoP - bacteria ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , we concluded that the prg : : TnphoA mutations that we have identified did not , as single mutations , suppress the PhoP null phenotype .
PrgH and PhoPc mutants are defective in BME by cultured epithelial cells .
The following several observations led us to test for BME of strains withpig : : TnphoA insertions : ( i ) Lee and Falkow have previously demonstrated that factors necessary for bacterial uptake by epithelial cells were induced upon anaerobic - growth ( 21 ) and that the expression of one prg locus , prgB , was dramatically induced under these growth - conditions , ( ii ) prgH mutants were defective in competition with wild - type organisms upon reaching the bloodstream of mice in the first 72 h after oral ingestion , and ( iii ) prgHl : : TnphoA was located at 59 min on the bacterial chromosome , a location where other genes essential to invasion are clustered .
Therefore , the BME ofprg : : TnphoA and PhoPc S. typhimurium strains was tested .
Strains with prgH and pho - 24 mutations had a significant reduction ( P < 0.01 ) in their abilities to induce uptake by MDCK polarized epithelial cells compared with wild - type bacteria .
Otherprg strains with TnphoA insertions did not demonstrate a statistically significant defect in BME by epithelial cells ( Table 5 ) .
The adherence of strains defective in BME was unaffected by the prgH : : TnphoA insertion when determined by cellassociated CFU/ml before the administration of gentamicin ( Table 5 ) and by microscopy ( data not shown ) .
prgH is within the hil locus .
With the findings that prgH was located at 59 min and that prgHl : : TnphoA insertions resulted in decreased BME , we wished to determine the location ofprgH relative to those of other invasion loci at 59 min .
P22 transduction linkage analysis indicated that the TnJOA16A17 of strain AK3304 had linkage similar to those of invA ( 40 % ) ( 12 ) and prgH ( 37 % ) ; however , invA was not linked to sorbitol .
The prgHl : : TnphoA insertion was found to be highly linked ( 99.6 % ) to the transposon insertion of EE517 , a strain with an 8.5 - kb deletion adjacent to the TnSB50 - 378 insertion of hil ( 22 ) .
This demonstrated that prgH was highly linked to hil .

Adherence was determined as the percentage of bacteria adhered to the cells after centrifugation and 30 min of incubation at 4 °C / total number of bacteria added to each well .
Invasion was determined as the percentage of bacteria that had invaded after a 2 - h incubation with gentamicin/total number of bacteria added to each well .
There was no difference between S. typhimurium wild - type and S. enteritidis CDC5 wildtype strains with respect to adherence and invasion frequencies .
Asterisks represent statistical significance by variance analysis of the invasion data done in triplicate compared with those for the wild type ( P < 0.01 ) .
surrounding the TnphoA insertion of strain IB037 was constructed ( Fig. 1 ) .
The published restriction endonuclease map of the invA - E region did not indicate any similarities .
Plasmids containing the cloned inv and hil DNA were then used as probes in Southern hybridization analysis of chromosomal DNA from wild - type ATCC 10428s and IB040 bacteria containing the prgHl : : TnphoA insertion .
When plasmid pSB300 , which contains other invasion loci highly linked to invA - E ( invH , invF , and part of invG ) ( lla ) , was used as a probe , no differences in hybridization patterns between wild - type bacteria and strain IB040 were found .
This indicated that prgH was not located within the inv region .
However , when plasmid pVB3 ( kindly provided by C. Lee and V. Bajaj ) , comprising a 5 - kb region immediately downstream of the TnSB50 - 380 insertion of hil , was used as a probe , the prgHl : : TnphoA insertion was demonstrated to be located within this region ( data not shown ) .
By use of the known restriction map of the hit locus ( 22 ) and the known restriction endonuclease sites of TnphoA , the physical map of this area and the relationship of prgHl : : TnphoA within it were further defined ( Fig. 1 ) .
Interestingly , the prgHI : : TnphoA insertion was oriented so that the direction of transcription of thephoA fusion protein was opposite that of the TnSB50 insertions that confer the hil phenotype and contain a constitutive neomycin promoter that is transcribed out of the transposon ( Fig. 1 ) .
Since it was possible that a protein whose expression was altered by the TnSB50 - 380 insertion might alter the expression of prgH , strains containing both insertions were constructed and the prgH - phoA fusion protein activities were compared under different environmental conditions .
Interestingly , derepression of fusion protein activity when bacteria were starved or grown anaerobically was observed ( Fig. 1 ) .
This demonstrated that the TnSB50 - 380 insertion increased prgH expression , even though prgH transcription was opposite that of the TnSBS0 - 380 - encoded neomycin promoter .
To rule out the possibility that the BME defect of theprgH mutant was an artifact of the PhoA fusion protein produced , complementation analysis was performed with plasmid 4482 BEHLAU AND MILLER J. BACTERIOL .

All of the numbers represent activity in units of AP as defined by Miller for 13 - galactosidase ( 30 ) .

Plasmid pWKSH5 was crossed into PrgH ( IB040 ) and PhoPc ( CS022 ) mutant bacteria to create strains IB043 and IB044 , respectively .
The BME phenotype of the PrgH mutant was similar to that of the wild type with the insertion of pWKSH5 , while that of the PhoPc mutant was not complemented by pWKSH5 ( Table 5 ) .
Therefore , we conclude that a gene product altered in synthesis as a result of theprgH : : TnphoA insertion was necessary for BME .
DISCUSSION Pathogenic bacteria possess regulatory mechanisms to control the expression of virulence - factors in response to environmental signals ( 26 , 29 ) .
In S. typhimurium , the synthesis of virulence - factors encoded byphoP - activated genes ( pag genes ) is induced by the PhoP/PhoQ regulators in response to the acidic environment of macrophage phagosomes ( 3 ) .
In this work , by the use of a strain with a phoP/phoQ locus mutation that constitutively simulates the environmental activation of pag genes ( phenotype PhoPc ) , five unique phoP - repressed loci encoding envelope proteins were defined .
Consistent with PhoPIPhoQ functioning as global transcriptional regulators , phoP - repressed genes ( prg genes ) were found to be widely spaced on the chromosome .
One would predict that prg genes will be repressed in environmental conditions that activatepag expression .
Consistent with this prediction , the expression of prg loci was repressed under starvation conditions , when pag loci were induced ( Table 6 ) .
Some variability in repression of prg : : TnphoA activity was observed with strains with the PhoPc phenotype .
While two loci demonstrated complete repression of fusion protein activity , others demonstrated only partial repression ( Table 2 ) .
It is possible that the degree of repression of some pig loci may be greater whenpag genes are maximally activated within acidified macrophage phagosomes .
Consistent with this possibility is the observation that the expression ofpag genes in PhoPc strains is 5 - to 10 - fold less than that observed after bacteria are phagocytosed by macrophages ( 3 ) .
One prg locus , prgH , was found to contribute to mouse virulence when S. typhimurum was administered by both the oral and the intraperitoneal routes .
PrgH as well as PhoPc mutants were further found to be defective in bacterium - mediated uptake by epithelial cells , suggesting that an inability to cross epithelial barriers might contribute to the attenuation of virulence observed .
Competition studies with mice after oral ingestion of bacteria further supported the hypothesis thatprgH mutants were defective in transcytosis across the intestinal epithelial barrier .
Therefore , this work defined at least two phases of PhoP/PhoQ - regulated protein expression essential to bacterial virulence .
In one phase , prg expression promotes BME by epithelial cells ( Table 6 ) , while in another phase , pag expression promotes survival within macrophages ( 32 ) .
Other virulence regulators with two alternating phases of protein expression have been described previously ( 18 , 36 ) .
In Vibrio cholerae , growth - conditions that maximize the expression of the major ToxR - regulated virulence - factors , cholera toxin and the toxin - coregulated pili , also repress the expression of a number of proteins , including the major TABLE 6 .

175 , 1993 outer membrane protein OmpT ( 36 ) .
In Bordetella pertussis , mutations in BvgS , the environmental sensor component of the vir two - component system which activates the syntheses of pertussis toxin , adenylate cyclase , and filamentous hemagglutinin , can also repress the expression of flagellin ( 1 , 28 ) and virulence - factors encoded by vir - repressed genes ( vrg genes ) ( 4 ) .
Although the many microenvironments that an organism experiences are likely to be complex and constantly changing , the concept of two alternating phases of expression of virulence determinants has not only resulted in the isolation of virulence - factors but also provided a working model for the study of in - vivo regulation .
For systemic pathogens such as Salmonella species , the environments the organism experiences may be more complex and varied than those encountered by mucosal pathogens .
The achievement of intermediate states ofpag andprg expression could be essential to virulence at some stage of the infectious cycle .
Consistent with this possibility was the lack of uniformity in the expression ofpag andptg genes on growth observed at different oxygen tensions and pH conditions .
This may also indicate that not all regulation of pag and pig genes is mediated directly through PhoP and PhoQ .
Regardless of this possibility , it seems likely , given the function of PhoP as a transcriptional regulator , thatprg locus repression occurs at the level of transcription .
However , all prg loci were defined as protein fusions to AP , and posttranscriptional effects could be responsible for the regulation which we have observed .
Regardless of the mechanism of repression ofprg loci , the approach of defining genes repressed by the pho - 24 mutation has led to the discovery of at least one virulence locus , prgH .
The attenuation ofprgH mutants was much less than that observed in strains with the PhoPc phenotype , in which many proteins are repressed simultaneously .
Therefore , it seems likely that other prg virulence loci remain to be identified and that a loss of pag and prg regulation contributes to the defect of the PhoPc strain .
Nevertheless , the discovery of prgH demonstrates that virulence genes are oppositely regulated by PhoP/PhoQ and further documents thatpag andprg regulation in an appropriate environment is necessary for virulence .
prgH was found to be located at 59 min on the Salmonella chromosome ; this is a site where a number of other loci essential to epithelial cell invasion have been defined .
Linkage analysis and Southern hybridization data indicate that prgH is highly linked to the hyperinvasive locus ( hil ) .
This locus was defined by Lee et al. as TnSB50 insertions that result in strains that do not require microaerophilic growth to be invasive ( 22 ) .
We have demonstrated that prgH lies between two of these Tn5B50 insertions that confer a hil phenotype ( Fig. 1 ) .
Since deletion mutants in this region have been previously demonstrated to also have defects of BME ( 22 ) and since we have been able to complement the BME defect ofprgH mutants with a plasmid containing this locus , this further supports the hypothesis that a protein not synthesized as a result of the prgHl : : TnphoA insertion promotes BME ( Fig. 1 ) .
One would predict that genes essential to the hil phenotype would be induced under microaerophilic conditions ( 22 ) , similar to what was found for prgB .
Paradoxically , prgH expression was maximal during aerobic - growth , and the TnSB50 - 380 insertion , which results in a hil phenotype , derepressed expression ofprgH .
In addition , the direction of transcription predicted by the prgHl : : TnphoA insertion is opposite that of the Tn5B50 - 380 - encoded neomycin promoter associated with the hil phenotype .
Although other PhoP REGULATION OF SALMONELLA INVASION 4483 interpretations of this result are possible , this could mean that a regulatory protein interrupted by or transcribed from the TnSB50 - 380 insertion affects the expression of prgH .
It will be interesting to see whether other invasion genes are also regulated by PhoP/PhoQ .
In this respect , the observation that pWKSH5 , a plasmid containing prgH ( hil ) , did not complement PhoPc bacteria for BME is interesting .
If prgH were expressed from pWKSH5 , despite the presence of the pho - 24 mutation , this would support the possibility that other genes repressed as part of the PhoPc phenotype are necessary for BME .
In this work , the identification and characterization of prgH have shown that PhoP/PhoQ oppositely regulate factors necessary for bacteria to enter or to survive within mammalian cells .
This further documents the importance of gene regulation to bacterial virulence .
The identification of pig loci will allow us to further study the regulation of bacterial genes after infection of mammalian cells .
Understanding the regulation of virulence genes should aid in the development of new live vaccines for typhoid fever and increase our knowledge of the complex interactions between bacteria and mammalian cells .
