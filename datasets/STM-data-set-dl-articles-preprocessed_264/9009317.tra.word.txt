65 , No. 2 0019 - 9567/97 / $ 04.00 0 Simultaneous Prevention of Glutamine Synthesis and High - Affinity Transport Attenuates Salmonella typhimurium Virulence KARL E. KLOSE 1 AND JOHN J. MEKALANOS 1,2 * Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics 1 and Shipley Institute of Medicine , 2 Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 In Salmonella typhimurium , transcription of the glnA gene ( encoding glutamine synthetase ) is under the control of the nitrogen - regulatory ( ntr ) system comprising the alternate sigma factor 54 ( NtrA ) and the twocomponent sensor - transcriptional activator pair NtrB and NtrC .
The glnA , ntrB , and ntrC genes form an operon .
We measured the virulence of S. typhimurium strains with nitrogen - regulatory mutations after intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) or oral inoculations of BALB/c mice .
Strains with single mutations in glnA , ntrA , ntrB , orntrC had i.p. 50 % lethal doses ( LD 50 s ) of < 10 bacteria , similar to the wild - type strain .
However , a strain with a ( glnA - ntrC ) operon deletion had an i.p. LD 50 of > 10 5 bacteria , as did glnA ntrA and glnA ntrC strains , suggesting that glnA strains require an ntr - transcribed gene for full virulence .
High - level transcription of the glutamine transport operon ( glnHPQ ) is dependent upon both ntrA and ntrC , as determined by glnHp - lacZ fusion measurements .
Moreover , glnA glnH and glnA glnQ strains are attenuated , similar to glnA ntrA and glnA ntrC strains .
These results reveal that access of S. typhimurium to host glutamine depends on the ntr system , which apparently is required for the transcription of the glutamine transport genes .
The ( glnA - ntrC ) strain exhibited a reduced ability to survive within the macrophage cell line J774 , identifying a potential host environment with low levels of glutamine .
Finally , the ( glnA - ntrC ) strain , when inoculated at doses as low as 10 organisms , provided mice with protective immunity against challenge by the wild - type strain , demonstrating its potential use as a live vaccine .
Glutamate and glutamine serve as the primary nitrogen donors for all cellular metabolites in Salmonella typhimurium and other enteric bacteria ( for a review , see reference 51 ) .
The enzyme glutamine synthetase ( encoded by the glnA gene ) is the sole means for synthesis of glutamine .
Additionally , glutamine synthetase is responsible for all ammonia assimilation under conditions of low external nitrogen concentrations ( 57 ) .
Both the synthesis and the activity of glutamine synthetase are regulated in response to the availability of nitrogen .
Transcription of glnA is under the control of the nitrogenregulatory ( ntr ) system ( for a review , see reference 49 ) .
The major promoter ( P2 ) ( Fig. 1 ) is recognized by an alternate holoenzyme form of RNA polymerase containing 54 ( encoded by the ntrA gene ) , which requires an activator protein to form transcriptionally active open promoter complexes ( 19 , 54 ) .
The NtrC protein is a 54 transcriptional activator ; it binds cooperatively to two upstream sites and activates transcription under nitrogen - limiting conditions by directly contacting 54 - holoenzyme bound at the P2 promoter ( 48 , 50 , 52 , 60 ) .
NtrC must be phosphorylated to activate transcription ; the NtrB protein causes phosphorylated NtrC ( NtrC - P ) to be formed only under nitrogen - limiting conditions ( 24 , 43 ) .
The ntrB and ntrC genes lie downstream within the glnA operon ( 39 ) .
A secondary 70 - dependent promoter ( P1 ) ( Fig. 1 ) lies between the two NtrC binding sites ; the binding of NtrC at these two sites represses transcription from P1 ( 38 , 46 ) .
The high - affinity glutamine transport system , encoded by the glnHPQ operon , is also under the control of the ntr system : levels of the glutamine periplasmic binding protein ( GlnH ) are coordinately regulated with levels of glutamine synthetase ( 4 , and Molecular Genetics , Harvard Medical School , 200 Longwood Ave. , Boston , MA 02115 .
31 , 61 ) , as well as those of transport proteins for glutamateaspartate , histidine , and lysine - arginine - ornithine ( 31 ) .
In Escherichia coli , the major glnH promoter has been shown to be transcribed by 54 - holoenzyme and NtrC in - vitro .
At this promoter , contact between NtrC - P and 54 - holoenzyme is enhanced by the binding of integration host factor ( IHF ) at a site between the NtrC sites and the promoter ( 6 ) .
S. typhimurium is a bacterial pathogen which causes gastroenteritis in humans ( for a review , see reference 14 ) .
In mice , oral administration leads to a lethal systemic disease and serves as an animal model for human typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi .
After being ingested , salmonellae typically invade enterocytes of the small intestine , transcytose through the epithelium , and enter the lamina propria , where they are phagocytosed by macrophages ( 5 ) .
Salmonellae survive within macrophages and are transported to the liver and spleen , where they replicate and eventually cause systemic infection .
Little is known about the metabolic and nutritional activities required by salmonellae during infection .
We tested the effect of mutations altering glutamine synthesis and/or high - affinity glutamine transport on the pathogenic properties of S. typhimurium .
Our studies show that simultaneously preventing both glutamine synthesis and high - affinity transport attenuates S. typhimurium virulence .
Furthermore , strains defective for both glutamine synthesis and high - affinity transport provided protective immunity to mice subsequently challenged with a wild - type S. typhimurium strain , demonstrating the utility of this general approach for the construction of live oral vaccines .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Media .
Luria broth ( LB ) , in both liquid medium and agar plates , was routinely supplemented with 2 mM glutamine to allow the growth of strains with reduced levels of glutamine synthetase and was supplemented with antibiotics when appropriate .
Nutrient broth ( NB ) was used for the determination of glutamine auxotrophy ( Gln mutants can not grow on this medium unless it is supple - 587 588 KLOSE AND MEKALANOS INFECT .
Schematic representation of the S. typhimurium glnA promoter .
The major 54 - dependent promoter for the glnA gene is designated P2 , and the 70 - dependent promoter is designated P1 ( arrows ) .
54 - holoenzyme ( E - 54 ; core RNA polymerase associated with the ntrA gene product ) binds in a closed complex to a site with conserved elements centered at 12 and 24 with respect to the start site of 54 - dependent transcription ( dark box ) .
NtrC binds to two sites centered at 108 and 140 ( white boxes ) with respect to the 54 - dependent start site .
70 - dependent transcription is repressed when NtrC is bound at these two sites , and thus an ntrA strain is a glutamine auxotroph while an ntrC strain is a glutamine prototroph .
A glnAp356 mutation increases transcription from P1 and provides glutamine prototrophy to ntrA strains ( this mutation changesaGto an A at position 134 with respect to the 54 - dependent start site , which presumably lies in the 10 recognition sequence for 70 - holoenzyme ) .
Morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ( MOPS ) - based minimal - glucose ( 0.4 % ) medium ( 37 ) with 20 mM NH 4 Cl and 3 mM glutamine was used for - galactosidase assays ( see below ) .
Evans blue - uranine indicator plates ( 37 ) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine were utilized to purify all constructed strains free of P22 .
Minimal - glucose ( 0.4 % ) agar plates with 10 mM glutamate as the sole nitrogen source were overlaid with 100 l of 100 mM - glutamyl hydrazide ( ICN Biochemicals ) to assess the growth phenotype of strains with mutations in the glnHPQ operon ( colonies of glnHPQ mutants grow larger on this medium [ 31 , 61 ] ) .
LB agar , made without NaCl and supplemented with 10 % sucrose , was used to select for second recombinational events during construction of chromosomal deletions or insertions with vectors containing the sacB gene ( see below ) .
Degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on the amino - acid sequence of the E. coli glnHPQ genes ( 45 ) were used for PCR amplification of internal fragments from the S. typhimurium glnH , glnP , and glnQ genes .
The primers used to amplify the glnH internal fragment glnH were GLNH1 ( GCGGATCCTTYGTNCCNTTYGARTTYAA ) and GLNH2 ( GCG GAATTCARYTCCATRTANGCRTTRTC ) ; the underlined nucleotides represent restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI , respectively .
The primers used to amplify the glnP internal fragment glnP were GLNP1 ( GCGAATTCGGNAC NCCNATNGTNGTNCA ) and GLNP2 ( GCAAGCTTAGNGANGTRTCYTT NATRCT ) ; the underlined nucleotides represent restriction sites for EcoRI and HindIII , respectively .
The primers used to amplify the glnQ internal fragment glnQ were GLNQ1 ( GCGGAATTCCGGNATGGTNTTYCARCARTT ) and GLNQ3 ( GGCGAAGCTTACYTGNGGRTTNCCRTCYCTC ) ; the underlined nucleotides represent restriction sites for EcoRI and HindIII , respectively .
In the above - described primers , N represents any nucleotide , Y represents any pyrimidine , and R represents any purine .
Only one fragment was produced from strain ATCC 14028 chromosomal DNA with each pair of primers : a glnH fragment of approximately 400 bp in length , corresponding to the coding sequence for amino acids 35 to 168 of GlnH ; a glnP fragment of approximately 300 bp in length , corresponding to the coding sequence for amino - acids 64 to 164 of GlnP ; and a glnQ fragment of approximately 430 bp in length , corresponding to the coding sequence for amino - acids 80 to 222 of GlnQ .
PCR was performed for 30 cycles of45sat92 C , 1 min at 42 C , and 1 min 30 s at 72 C with TaqPlus DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) .
The oligonucleotides used to amplify a 461 - bp internal argT fragment , based on the published sequence of the argT gene of S. typhimurium ( 18 ) and corresponding to the coding sequence for amino - acids 15 to 168 of ArgT , were ARGT1 ( GCGGATCCGGCGCGACGGCGGCCAGTTAC ) and ARGT2 ( GC GAATTCGATAAGATCCTGGTTGGCATA ) ; the underlined nucleotides represent restriction sites for BamHI and EcoRI , respectively .
The oligonucleotides used to amplify a 1.05 - kbp fragment containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene from pACYC184 ( 53 ) were CAT1 ( GCAATTGCGGAAGATCAC TTCGCAGAA ) and CAT2 ( GCCAATTGTTTGAGAAGCACACGGTCAC ) ; the underlined nucleotides represent restriction sites for MfeI .
The oligonucleotides used to amplify a 730 - bp fragment containing the glnH promoter from ATCC 14028 ( based on the derived sequence ; see below ) were GLNHP6 ( GC TCTAGAGGAGATCTAAAGAACTGCCCGATCGCTACGCTGTTGTC ) and GLNHP7 ( GCGGTACCGGAGATCTAACGGAACGAACGCCGTATC GGTTGC ) ; the underlined nucleotides represent restriction sites for KpnI , BglII , XbaI , and BglII , respectively ( KpnI and XbaI sites were introduced for other purposes ) .
PCR was performed for 30 cycles of 45 s at 92 C , 1 min at 50 C , and 1min30sat72 C with Vent DNA polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) .
Plasmid pJES89 ( kindly provided by S. Kustu ) contains the 8.9 - kbp HindIII S. typhimurium chromosomal fragment containing the entire glnA ntrBC operon ligated into the HindIII site of pBR322 ( 59 ) from which the SalI site had been removed .
The in - frame glnA1 was made in the following manner : the 1.8 - kbp EcoRI fragment of pJES89 containing the glnA promoter and the aminoterminal coding sequence for glnA ( glnA ) was ligated into the EcoRI site of the temperature - sensitive suicide vector pMAK705 ( 15 ) to form pKEK3 .
The 4.1 - kbp EcoRI fragment of pJES89 containing the carboxyl - terminal coding sequence for glnA ( glnA ) and the entire coding sequence for ntrB and ntrC was ligated into pKEK3 which had been partially digested with EcoRI , resulting in pKEK4 , in which the EcoRI fragments are correctly oriented to produce an in - frame deletion within glnA ; the resulting construct was predicted to encode a glutamine synthetase lacking amino - acids 41 to 130 .
To create a deletion of ntrB and ntrC , pJES89 was digested with SalI and religated , removing a 2.6 - kbp SalI fragment which extends from within the coding sequence for the amino terminus of ntrB ( at the codon for amino - acid 23 ) to the SalI site downstream of the coding sequence for ntrC ( 155 bp downstream of the stop codon ) , forming pKEK9 [ ( ntrB - ntrC ) 1 ] .
The 1.6 - kbp partial EcoRI - HindIII fragment of pKEK9 containing the carboxyl - terminal portion of glnA ( starting at the codon for amino - acid 131 ) and ( ntrB - ntrC ) 1 was ligated into pBR322 ( 59 ) that had been digested with EcoRI and HindIII , forming pKEK10 .
pKEK9 was also digested with SalI , partially digested with BglII , made bluntended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase , and then religated to form pKEK34 , from which all coding sequence for glnA , ntrB , and ntrC has been removed [ ( glnA - ntrC ) 1 ] ; the deletion begins at the BglII site within the glnA promoter ( centered at 28 with respect to the start site of transcription from the 54 - dependent promoter ) and extends to the SalI site downstream of ntrC .
The BglII - HindIII fragment from pKEK34 containing ( glnA - ntrC ) 1 was ligated into pMAK705 ( 15 ) digested with BamHI and HindIII , forming pKEK55 .
To make plasmids for insertion mutations , the PCR - amplified fragments of S. typhimurium glnH and argT ( see above ) were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into pBR322 ( 59 ) digested with BamHI and EcoRI , forming pKEK11 ( glnH ) and pKEK56 ( argT ) , respectively ; the PCR - amplified fragments of S. typhimurium glnP and glnQ ( see above ) were digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into pBR322 ( 59 ) digested with EcoRI and HindIII , forming pKEK37 ( glnP ) and pKEK12 ( glnQ ) , respectively .
pKEK11 and pKEK56 were digested with BamHI , made blunt - ended with the Klenow fragment , digested with EcoRI , and then ligated into the suicide vector pGP704 ( 42 ) that had been digested with EcoRI and EcoRV , resulting in pKEK13 and pKEK57 .
pKEK12 was digested with HindIII , made blunt - ended with the Klenow fragment , digested with EcoRI , and then ligated into pGP704 ( 42 ) that had been digested with EcoRI and EcoRV , forming pKEK14 .
The ( glnH - P ) : : Cm r mutation was made as follows : the BamHI ( made bluntended with Klenow fragment ) - EcoRI fragment from pKEK11 ( see above ) was first ligated into pKEK37 that had been digested with AatII , made blunt - ended with mung bean nuclease , and then digested with EcoRI , forming pKEK58 , which contains glnH and glnP in the same orientation to form ( glnH - P ) 1 , which removes amino - acids 169 to 248 from the coding sequence of GlnH , the glnHQ intergenic region , and amino - acids 1 to 63 from the coding sequence of GlnP .
The PCR - amplified chloramphenicol resistance gene from pACYC184 ( 53 ) ( see above ) was digested with MfeI and ligated into pKEK58 that had been digested with EcoRI , forming pKEK59 [ ( glnH - P ) 1 : : Cm r ] .
pKEK59 was used as a template in PCR amplification with GLNH1 and GLNP2 ( see above ) and ligated into the suicide vector pCVD442 ( 8 ) digested with SmaI , forming pKEK60 .
For sequencing the glnHPQ operon , chromosomal DNA from strain KK110 ( see below ) was purified , digested to completion with HindIII , and then ligated into pWSK30 ( 58 ) , with selection for a plasmid conferring chloramphenicol resistance .
The resulting plasmid , pKEK61 , contains ( glnH - P ) 1 : : Cm r within an approximately 15 - kbp chromosomal fragment .
To make a chromosomal glnHp - lacZYA fusion , the PCR - amplified glnHp67 fragment ( see above ) was digested with BglII and ligated into pRS551 ( 56 ) digested with BamHI .
A plasmid containing the correct glnHp - lacZ fusion was named pKEK69 .
E. coli DH5 ( 16 ) was used for all cloning manipulations unless the vector being used was a derivative of pGP704 ( 42 ) or pCVD442 ( 8 ) , which contain the R6K origin of replication and therefore require the product of the pir gene for replication , in which case E. coli DH5 pir or SM10 pir ( 42 ) was used .
For construction of the glnHp - lacZ chromosomal fusion , E. coli TE2680 and TE1335 ( 10 ) were used in intermediate steps ( see below ) .
S. typhimurium strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
All S. typhimurium strains used are isogenic with strain ATCC 14028 , referred to as the wild type .
Mutant strains were constructed utilizing the high - transducing phage P22 HT int ( 55 ) , and their construction is outlined in Table 1 , the paternal donor upon which the P22 lysate was made being listed first , followed by the recipient .
P22 phage lysate from SK811 ( zig214 : : Tn10 hisF645 [ 29 ] ) or SK2899 ( zig : : Kan r hisF645 [ 27 ] ) was used to transduce strain SK35 [ ( glnA - ntrC ) 60 hisF645 ] ( 29 , 39 ) to tetracycline or kanamycin resistance , respectively , while retaining glutamine auxotrophy , thus linking the deletion to an antibiotic resistance marker ; the resulting strains were used as donors to transduce ATCC 14028 to tetracycline or kanamycin resistance and glutamine auxotrophy , forming strains KK4 [ ( glnA - ntrC ) 60 zig214 : : Tn10 ] and KK38 [ ( glnA - ntrC ) 60 zig : : Kan r ] , respectively .
The zig214 : : Tn10 insertion has been precisely mapped to a location lying in the promoter region of hemN ( 21 ) , which lies downstream of ntrC ; because strains with this insertion maintain a HemN phenotype , strain KK14 ( zig214 : : Tn10 ) was used as the wild type in competition assays ( see below ) .

SK840 ( glnAp356 hisF645 [ 38 ] ) was used to transduce KK4 [ ( glnA - ntrC ) 60 zig214 : : Tn10 ] to glutamine prototrophy on NB agar ; a tetracycline - sensitive transductant ( KK6 ) , which was shown to contain the glnAp356 mutation by a transductional backcross , was used as a recipient in a cross with phage lysate from SK284 ( ntrA209 : : Tn10 hisF645 [ 29 ] ) to form strain KK8 ( glnAp356 ntrA209 : : Tn10 ; the glnAp356 mutation is a suppressor of glutamine auxotrophy in an ntrA background ) .
Strain KK27 ( glnA1 ) was made by first transforming ATCC 14028 with pKEK4 ( see above ) and selecting for a Cm r colony at 30 C , the permissive temperature for replication of this plasmid .
This 14028 strain harboring pKEK4 was grown in LB with 2 mM glutamine to mid - log phase at 30 C , then plated on LB supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 20 g of chloramphenicol per ml and allowed to grow overnight at 42 C , at which temperature the plasmid can not replicate , thus selecting for cointegrants .
Several Cm r colonies were restreaked , allowed to grow on the same medium at 42 C , inoculated into LB plus 2 mM glutamine , and grown for two rounds at the replication permissive temperature of 30 C to saturation .
This culture was diluted and plated on LB plus 2 mM glutamine at 30 C ; colonies were then patched onto NB and LB plus 2 mM glutamine and 20 g of chloramphenicol per ml to identify a Gln Cm s strain , indicating that a second recombinational event had occurred to create a chromosomal deletion .
Strain KK27 was shown to contain the correct chromosomal glnA1 by PCR and sequence analysis .
Strains KK44 , KK49 , and KK82 were constructed by first electroporating plasmids pKEK13 , pKEK14 , and pKEK57 , respectively , into SL4213F pir ( 35 ) to obtain protective methylation ; then these plasmids were electroporated into ATCC 14028 and plated on LB plus 2 mM glutamine and 100 g of ampicillin per ml at 37 C .
These plasmids contain internal gene fragments in a vector which requires the pir gene product for replication , so the resulting strains have insertions caused by the cointegration of pKEK13 ( glnH1 : : pGP704 [ Amp r ] ) , pKEK14 ( glnQ1 : : pGP704 [ Amp r ] ) , and pKEK57 ( argT1 : : pGP704 [ Amp R ] ) ; the mutations were moved by P22 - mediated transduction into ATCC 14028 to form strains KK44 , KK49 , and KK82 , respectively .
Strains KK44 and KK49 were confirmed to have insertions in the glnHPQ operon by growth phenotype ( see above ) , and KK82 was shown to have an insertion in argT by transductional linkage ; insertions were also confirmed by Southern blot analysis .
Strain KK85 , which contains a complete deletion of all coding sequence of the glnA ntrBC operon [ ( glnA - ntrC ) 1 ] , was constructed in several steps .
First , pKEK10 ( see above ) was electroporated into SK35 [ ( glnA - ntrC ) 60 hisF645 ] ( 29 , 39 ) , and colonies were selected by growth on NB agar , on which only glutamine prototrophs can grow ; SK35 contains a partial deletion that extends from the C - terminal coding region of glnA to the amino - terminal coding region of ntrC , and pKEK10 lacks the amino - terminal coding region of glnA .
This selection resulted in the formation of KK79 by a double - crossover event [ ( ntrB - C ) 1 hisF645 ] .
The ( ntrB - C ) 1 mutation was moved into the ATCC 14028 background by P22 - mediated transduction into KK38 with selection for Gln on NB agar ; a Kan s transductant was chosen , indicating that zig : : Kan r had been replaced during the transduction , to give KK80 [ ( ntrB - C ) 1 ] .
pKEK55 was then electroporated into KK80 , with selection for Cm r at 30 C and subsequent selection at 42 C followed by growth at 30 C as outlined above for KK27 , resulting in strain KK85 [ ( glnA - ntrC ) 1 ] .
The correct chromosomal deletion was confirmed by both PCR and Southern blot analysis .
Strains containing the ( glnH - P ) : : Cm r mutation were made by performing the following steps .
pKEK60 was mated into KK14 ( zig214 : : Tn10 ) from E. coli SM10 pir ( 42 ) by streaking the two strains together on LB plus 2 mM glutamine , incubating them overnight , and then streaking for single colonies on LB supplemented with 2 mM glutamine , 100 g of ampicillin per ml , and 12 g of tetracycline per ml .
Single colonies were grown overnight in LB plus 2 mM glutamine at 37 C and then diluted 1:1,000 in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and 100 l was plated on LB plus 2 mM glutamine and 10 % sucrose and grown overnight at 30 C .
The integrated plasmid contains the sacB gene ( 8 ) , the expression of which is lethal on this medium ; thus , there is selection for a second recombinational event .
Sucrose - resistant colonies were tested for antibiotic resistance ; a Cm r Amp s strain was used as the donor for P22 - mediated transduction into ATCC 14028 and KK27 , forming strains KK111 and KK110 , respectively .
Confirmation of correct chromosomal integration into the glnHPQ operon was obtained by sequencing the flanking DNA ( see below ) , and the nature of the mutation was confirmed by phenotypic characterization ( see above ) .
The creation of the glnHp - lacZ chromosomal fusion cassette inserted into the putPA locus is briefly outlined here ; the technique is more thoroughly explained elsewhere ( 10 , 22 ) .
pKEK69 was linearized by cleavage with PstI and electroporated into E. coli TE2680 ( 10 ) .
A Kan r Cm s Lac strain was chosen , indicating that the glnHp - lacZ fusion had been correctly integrated into the chromosome .
This E. coli intermediate strain was then mated with E. coli TE1335 ( which contains lysogenized P22 [ 9 ] ) to form a P22 lysate by zygotic induction , which was then used to transduce S. typhimurium SL4213 ( r m [ 11 ] ) to Kan r , forming KK116 .
This strain thus contains the insertion putPA1303 : : [ Kan r - glnHp - lacZYA ] .
As a control , plasmid without insert , pRS551 ( 56 ) , was inserted into the S. typhimurium SL4213 chromosome in the same manner to form KK139 .
The glnHp - lacZ fusion from KK116 and the promoterless insertion in KK139 , as well as the glnAp - lacZ fusion from SK3041 and lacUV5p - lacZ fusion from SK3082 ( 22 ) , were transferred by P22 - mediated transduction to all other S. typhimurium strains listed in Table 1 .

The competitive index is reported as the ratio of output bacteria ( mutant/wild type ) recovered from the spleen divided by the ratio of input bacteria ( mutant/wild type ) inoculated i.p. Numbers are the averages of values for two mice per inoculum .
The closer the mutant resembles the wild type , the closer the index is to 1 .
b Strain KK14 ( zig214 : : Tn10 ) was used as the wild type ( see Materials and Methods ) in competition with 14028 ; input and output were thus scored for Tet r .
Cycle dideoxynucleotide sequencing was carried out with an ABI sequencing kit and an ABI model 373AStretch sequencer .
The complete nucleotide sequence of the S. typhimurium glnHPQ operon was determined from both strands of pKEK61 by using specific oligonucleotide primers ; the portion of glnH - glnQ sequence not contained in this plasmid was determined from a PCR product derived from amplification of ATCC 14028 chromosomal DNA with specific primers , utilizing Vent DNA polymerase ( New England BioLabs ) to virtually eliminate any mispriming .
Strains were grown overnight in MOPS ( 0.4 % glucose ) minimal - medium ( 37 ) with 20 mM NH 4 Cl and 3 mM glutamine , then reinoculated into the same medium and grown at 37 C. Samples were assayed at an optical density at 600 nm of approximately 0.2 to 0.4 , permeabilized with chloroform and sodium dodecyl sulfate , and assayed for - galactosidase activity according to the method of Miller ( 40 ) .
J774 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 buffered with 25 mM HEPES ( Cellgro/Mediatech ) and supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; GIBCO/BRL ) , penicillin - streptomycin ( 50 U/ml and 50 g/ml , respectively ; GIBCO/BRL ) , and 2 mM glutamine .
HEp - 2 cells were grown without antibiotics in minimal essential medium ( Cellgro/Mediatech ) supplemented with 5 % FBS and 2 mM glutamine .
Wells of 24 - well ( 16 - mm ) microtiter culture dishes were seeded with 5 10 5 J774 cells or HEp - 2 cells for macrophage survival and invasion assays , respectively , and incubated overnight at 37 C in5 % CO 2 .
The macrophage survival assay ( see Fig. 3 ) was carried out essentially as described previously ( 34 ) , with the following alterations .
J774 cells were washed three times with PBS and overlaid with RPMI 1640 containing 5 % FBS , with or without 2 mM glutamine ( no antibiotics ) .
Bacteria were grown aerobically to stationary - phase , washed once with PBS , diluted in PBS containing 1 % mouse immune serum ( from mice that survived inoculation with strain KK4 and subsequent challenge with 14028 ; opsonization of S. typhimurium enhances uptake into macrophages ) , and incubated for 30 min at 37 C. Bacteria ( 5 10 6 ) were added to each well ; the culture dish was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 rpm and then incubated for 30 min at 37 C in5 % CO 2 .
Wells were washed three times with PBS , overlaid with RPMI 1640 containing 5 % FBS plus 5 g of gentamicin per ml ( an empirically derived minimum bactericidal concentration ) with or without 2 mM glutamine , and incubated at 37 C in5 % CO 2 .
At various time points , the wells to be assayed were washed three times with PBS , lysed with 500 l of 0.5 % sodium desoxycholate , and then rinsed with 500 l of PBS ; the lysate and rinse were combined , diluted , and plated on LB agar supplemented with 2 mM glutamine to determine CFUs .
For the HEp - 2 invasion assay , bacteria were grown under oxygen - limited conditions as previously described ( 32 ) , and the invasion assay was carried out as previously described ( 2 ) .
Female 6 - to 8 - week - old BALB/c mice ( Charles River Breeding Facility ) were used in all studies .
S. typhimurium strains were grown overnight at 37 C to stationary - phase in LB plus 2 mM glutamine , washed once , diluted to an appropriate concentration in PBS ( for intraperitoneal inoculations ) or 0.1 M NaHCO 3 ( for peroral inoculations ) , and administered to animals in 100 - l inocula ; control animals received either PBS or NaHCO 3 alone .
Inocula were plated on LB plus 2 mM glutamine to determine CFUs .
For 50 % lethal dose ( LD 50 ) studies , groups of five mice were inoculated per dilution ; survival was measured for 4 weeks postinoculation .
For vaccine studies , mice that survived 4 weeks past administration of the initial inoculum were then challenged with ATCC 14028 ( wild type ) administered either intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) or perorally .
For competition assays , strains were mixed to give inocula with a 1:1 or 100:1 ratio of mutant to wild type ( the actual numbers of organisms inoculated VOL .

RESULTS Single mutations in genes involved with glutamine synthesis do not affect the virulence of S. typhimurium .
S. typhimurium strains with single mutations in either glnA ( glutamine synthetase ) or one of the genes that regulate glnA transcription ( ntrA , ntrB , orntrC ) were tested for virulence properties in BALB/c mice .
We utilized both a competition assay , to determine a mutant 's fitness relative to that of the wild - type strain , and an LD 50 assay to determine the effect of these mutations on S. typhimurium virulence ( Table 2 ) .
An ntrB or ntrC strain ( KK10 or KK2 , respectively ) showed no significant defect in virulence either in a competition assay or in an i.p. LD 50 assay ( the Tn10 insertion in ntrB is polar on ntrC , and these strains are thus ntrBC ) .
A glnA strain ( KK27 ) was approximately 10 - fold less competitive and an ntrA strain ( KK1 ) was approximately 100 - fold less competitive than an isogenic wild - type strain , and yet both these strains had i.p. LD 50 s identical to that of wild - type .
The average number of days until death at an i.p. inoculum of 10 bacteria was also noticeably longer in mice infected with the ntrA strain than in mice infected with the wild - type strain ( 10.6 vs. 6.2 ) ( data not shown ) .
The ntrA strain had an oral LD 50 comparable to that of the wild - type strain .
The competitive defect in an ntrA strain was significantly overcome by the introduction of glnAp356 , a suppressing mutation which makes an ntrA strain a glutamine prototroph ( strain KK8 [ Table 1 ] ) ( this mutation increases transcription from the 70 - dependent glnA promoter P1 [ Fig. 1 ] [ 38 ] ) .
These results indicate that the competitive defect in an ntrA strain is primarily due to low levels of glnA transcription and not to the absence of some other gene transcribed by 54 - holoenzyme .
Combination of glnA with ntrA or ntrC attenuates S. typhimurium virulence .
We combined the in - frame glnA deletion mutation with mutations in the regulatory gene ntrA or ntrC and tested these strains for virulence properties in BALB/c mice .
glnA ntrA ( KK30 ) and glnA ntrC ( KK34 ) strains were more than 10 4 - fold less competitive than an isogenic wild - type strain and had i.p. LD 50 values at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild - type strain ( Table 3 ) .
Moreover , partial and complete deletions of the glnA ntrBC operon [ ( glnA - ntrC ) 60 and ( glnA - ntrC ) 1 ; KK4 and KK85 , respectively ] were also more than 10 4 - fold less competitive and had i.p. LD 50 values at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild - type strain ( Table 3 ) .
KK4 also had an oral LD 50 at least 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild - type strain .
These levels of attenuation are similar to those seen in a strain carrying a mutation in the virulence regulatory gene phoP ( KK16 ) ( Table 3 ) .
The high - affinity glutamine transport operon glnHPQ is transcribed by the ntr system .
The data presented above indicate that in a glnA strain , ntrA and ntrC are required to transcribe a gene ( s ) for glutamine acquisition to allow full virulence .
We suspected that the high - affinity glutamine transport operon glnHPQ might fulfill this role because the glnH gene product has been shown to be coregulated along with glutamine synthetase by the ntr system in S. typhimurium ( 31 ) and because the glnH promoter from E. coli is transcribed by 54 ( NtrA ) and NtrC in a purified in - vitro system ( 6 ) .
To investigate this possibility , we first cloned and sequenced the entire S. typhimurium glnHPQ operon : the predicted gene TABLE 4 .

Strain KK140 ( putPA : : lacZ ) grown in this medium has 8 Miller units of activity , which can be considered background activity .

e Krajewska - Grynkiewicz and Kustu reported 10 - fold increases in glutaminebinding protein ( GlnH ) over that of wild - type in glnA strains ( 29 ) ; we suspect that our failure to see a 10 - fold increase in this assay is due to one of the following : ( i ) differences in strain background , ( ii ) differences in assay conditions ( e.g. , log versus stationary - phase , media used ) , or ( iii ) difference in measuring glnH transcription versus GlnH antigen .
f We are unable to explain this reproducible decrease in glnA transcription in a himD background ; the effect of IHF on glnA transcription has never been studied .

Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the glnH promoters from S. typhimurium and E. coli .
The top line depicts the nucleotide sequence of the S. typhimurium glnH promoter ( S.t. ) , and that from E. coli is on the bottom line ( E.c. ) ( 45 ) .
Two transcription start sites have been mapped in the E. coli promoter ( 44 ) and are indicated by vertical bars and labeled 1 .
The second transcription start site is 54 dependent ( 6 ) , and the bases are numbered with respect to this start site ; gaps have been introduced between 2 and 3intheE .
coli sequence and between 33 and 34 in the S. typhimurium sequence to enhance alignment .
54 - holoenzyme ( E 54 ) bound in a closed complex protects the E. coli sequence shown with a dark box .
NtrC binds to two overlapping high - affinity sites in the E. coli sequence ( marked 2 and 3 [ black boxes ] ) at low concentrations and to two additional low - affinity sites ( marked 1 and 4 [ white boxes ] ) at higher concentrations .
IHF binds to a site marked with a stippled gray box in the E. coli sequence .
Potential half - sites for NtrC binding which resemble the consensus GGTGCA ( 50 ) have been underlined in the S. typhimurium sequence ; two half - sites appear to overlap ( within sites 2 and 3 ) .
products are highly homologous to the E. coli glnHPQ gene products ( 96 , 95 , and 95 % amino - acid identity , respectively ; 86 , 83 , and 85 % nucleotide identity , respectively ) and lie downstream of the pexB gene , as do the E. coli homologs .
The S. typhimurium glnH promoter shares 66 % nucleotide identity with that from E. coli ( Fig. 2 ) .
Moreover , the putative 54 - holoenzyme ( E 54 ) binding site in the S. typhimurium sequence matched that in the E. coli sequence at 15 of 17 nucleotides , and several reasonably good sequence motifs could be matched to the optimal S. typhimurium NtrC binding site TGCACCN 5 GGTGCA ( 50 ) .
We made a chromosomal glnHp - lacZ - transcriptional - fusion cassette and measured - galactosidase activities in the various strains with glnA and ntr mutations ( Table 4 ) .
glnAp - lacZ and lacUV5p - lacZ - transcriptional - fusion cassettes were assayed in the same strains as ntr - dependent and ntr - independent controls , respectively .
Growth conditions for all strains was in ammonia - excess minimal - medium ( 20 mM NH 4 , 3 mM glutamine ) .
Relatively high - level glnH transcription was seen in the wild - type strain , as well as in strains with glnA or glnH mutations .
However , a mutation in ntrC reduced glnH transcription by approximately 5 - fold while an ntrA mutation reduced glnH transcription more than 10 - fold , and these reductions were also seen in the attenuated double - mutant strains KK4 and KK30 [ ( glnA - ntrC ) and glnA ntrA , respectively ] .
Approximately 8 - to 30 - fold reductions were seen in these ntrA and ntrC strains at the well - characterized ntr - regulated glnA promoter , while lacUV5 transcription remained relatively constant .
These results indicate that the glnH promoter is indeed regulated by the ntrA and ntrC gene products in S. typhimurium .
Combination of glnA with mutations in the high - affinity glutamine transport operon attenuates S. typhimurium virulence .
Single insertion mutations in either glnH ( KK44 ) or glnQ ( KK49 ) , or a deletion - insertion ( glnH - P ) : : Cm r mutation ( KK111 ) , have no effect on S. typhimurium virulence , as determined by both a competition assay and i.p. LD 50 measurements ( Table 2 ) .
Combination of the in - frame glnA deletion mutation with mutations in glnH ( KK45 ) or glnQ ( KK50 ) or with ( glnH - P ) : : Cm r ( KK110 ) caused at least a 10 4 - fold decrease in competitiveness and increased the i.p. LD 50 values by at least 4 orders of magnitude ( Table 3 ) .
This effect was specific to mutations in the glnHPQ operon ; we combined glnA with mutations in two other ntr - regulated transport genes ( 31 ) , hisJ ( KK76 ) and argT ( KK83 ) , and both strains had i.p. LD 50 values similar to that of the wild - type strain ( Table 3 ) .
Furthermore , ntr - mediated transcription remains high in the highly attenuated glnA glnH strain ( Table 4 ) , indicating that no other ntr - regulated gene besides the glnHPQ operon is sufficient for the glutamine acquisition necessary for full virulence .
The E. coli glnH promoter has an IHF binding site ; when bound to this site , IHF serves to facilitate contact between NtrC and 54 - holoenzyme and thus to increase glnH transcription ( 6 ) .
If IHF serves the same function at the S. typhimurium glnH promoter , we predict that a mutation in himD , the subunit of IHF , combined with glnA might increase the i.p. LD 50 , similar to mutations in ntrA or ntrC .
However , the himD mutation alone ( KK26 ) attenuates S. typhimurium similar to the other attenuated strains , as measured by both competition assay and i.p. LD 50 ( Table 3 ) , such that the contribution of this mutation in a glnA strain ( KK32 ) is unclear .
The himD mutation has only a slight negative effect ( approximately twofold ) on glnH transcription ( Table 4 ) under our assay conditions , so it remains unclear from our data whether IHF is involved in expression of this operon .
A ( glnA - ntrC ) strain is defective for survival in the macrophage cell line J774 .
Strains KK1 ( ntrA : : Tn10 ) , KK10 ( ntrB : : Tn10 ) , KK4 [ ( glnA - ntrC ) ] , KK8 ( ntrA : : Tn10 glnAp356 ) , and KK16 ( phoP ) and the wild - type strain 14028 were tested for their ability to survive in the murine macrophage cell line J774 ( Fig. 3 ) ; in this assay , the culture medium contained 2 mM glutamine .
An ntrB : : Tn10 strain ( KK10 ; ntrBC Gln ) grows to levels in the macrophage similar to those of the wild - type VOL .

An ntrA : : Tn10 strain ( KK1 ) was equally defective for intramacrophage survival .
This defect is specifically caused by low - level glutamine synthesis and/or transport , because the addition of the suppressing glnAp356 mutation to the ntrA strain ( KK8 ) restores intramacrophage survival to the wildtype level .
Similar results were obtained when glutamine was not added to the culture medium ( data not shown ) .
These results potentially identify the macrophage phagolysosome as a low - glutamine host environment in which S. typhimurium must grow .
These same strains were tested for their ability to invade HEp - 2 cells , a characteristic of pathogenic S. typhimurium ( 32 ) .
All strains were equally able to invade HEp - 2 cells ( less than 3 - fold differences in bacterial recovery resulted ) , while a control strain carrying a mutation in the essential invasion gene invA ( KK13 ) was more than 150 - fold defective for invasion ( data not shown ) .
Strains with simultaneous defects in glutamine synthesis and high - affinity transport provide protective immunity against S. typhimurium .
Mice were inoculated with various doses of attenuated S. typhimurium strains , and survivors were challenged 4 weeks later with the wild - type strain ( Table 4 ) .
A strain with a ( glnA - ntrC ) 60 mutation ( KK4 ) served remarkably well as a vaccine .
Doses as low as 10 organisms delivered i.p. provided protection against i.p. challenge with 10 5 wildtype cells .
In large inocula ( 10 5 i.p. , 10 9 oral ) , this strain is protective against both i.p. and oral wild - type challenges .
Survival of S. typhimurium strains within J774 macrophages .
Macrophages ( 5 10 5 / well ) were infected ( see Materials and Methods ) with S. typhimurium strains 14028 ( wild type ) ( ■ ) , KK10 ( ntrB : : Tn10 ) ( ) KK8 ( ntrA : : Tn10 glnAp356 ) ( -RCB- ) , KK1 ( ntrA : : Tn10 ) ( E ) , KK4 [ ( glnA - ntrC ) ] ( Ç ) , and KK16 ( phoP ) ( F ) .
The number of viable bacteria at each time point was determined by lysing the macrophages and plating .
Results are expressed as the averages of values for three wells .
The values with standard deviations for the 24 - h time point were as follows : 14028 ( wild type ) , 1.5 10 6 3.8 10 5 ; KK10 ( ntrB : : Tn10 ) , 9.1 10 5 2.0 10 5 ; KK8 ( ntrA : : Tn10 glnAp356 ) , 7.2 10 5 1.2 10 5 ; KK1 ( ntrA : : Tn10 ) , 6.0 10 4 4.0 10 3 ; KK4 [ ( glnA - ntrC ) ] , 5.9 10 4 1.0 10 4 ; and KK16 ( phoP ) , 3.3 10 4 9.5 10 3 .
complete operon deletion ( glnA - ntrC ) 1 ( KK85 ) also protected against wild - type i.p. challenge at the single large initial inoculum ( 10 5 ) tested .
A glnA ntrA double mutant ( KK30 ) gave full protection against wild - type i.p. challenge when administered in small ( 10 ) and large ( 10 5 ) i.p. inocula , whereas a glnA ntrC double mutant ( KK34 ) was not as effective in a small initial inoculum ( 10 ) but gave good protection when inoculated at 10 5 organisms .
As a comparison , a strain with a mutation in the virulence - regulatory gene phoP ( KK16 ) did not work well as a vaccine ; although the strain was highly attenuated , protective immunity resulted in only two of five mice which received a large ( 10 5 ) initial inoculum .
In large inocula ( 10 5 i.p. ) , glnA glnH ( KK45 ) , glnA glnQ ( KK50 ) , and glnA ( glnH - P ) ( KK110 ) double - mutant strains provided full protection against wild - type i.p. challenge .
A glnA glnH strain ( KK45 ) was fully protective against wild - type i.p. or oral challenge when administered either i.p. or orally .
glnA glnH and glnA glnQ double - mutant strains were less effective when delivered in doses smaller than 10 3 i.p. Strains with a single IHF mutation , himD ( KK26 ) , were attenuated but provided only partial protection against wild - type challenge at a large ( 10 5 ) inoculum ; a glnA himD strain provided no protective immunity against subsequent wild - type challenge at the single large i.p. inoculum ( 10 5 ) .
DISCUSSION Our studies have shown that neither prevention of glutamine synthesis nor prevention of high - affinity glutamine transport alone attenuates S. typhimurium virulence .
Both a glutamine auxotroph ( glnA ) and mutants defective for high - affinity glutamine transport ( glnH and glnQ ) have the same low i.p. LD 50 s ( 10 ) as that of a wild - type strain .
However , double mutations of glnA and glnH or of glnA and glnQ increase the i.p. LD 50 to 10 5 , similar to a strain defective for the virulence - regulatory protein PhoP .
These results demonstrate that an S. typhi - 594 KLOSE AND MEKALANOS INFECT .
murium glutamine auxotroph must acquire glutamine from the host by utilizing the high - affinity glutamine transport system .
A glnA strain can be similarly attenuated by mutation of either ntrA or ntrC or by deletion of the entire glnA ntrBC operon .
Mutations in ntrA and ntrC result in decreased transcription of the glnHPQ operon , consistent with the attenuated phenotype of these strains resulting from decreased high - affinity glutamine transport .
Kustu et al. have previously shown that levels of the periplasmic high - affinity glutamine - binding protein ( GlnH ) are coregulated with levels of glutamine synthetase , as well as several other amino - acid transport systems , through the ntr system ( 31 ) .
NtrC and 54 - holoenzyme have further been shown to transcribe the glnH promoter of E. coli in - vitro ( 6 ) .
Our results have extended the characterization of high - affinity glutamine transport in S. typhimurium to show that ( i ) the sequence of the S. typhimurium glnH promoter is homologous to that from E. coli and shares a consensus 54 - holoenzyme binding site as well as several apparent NtrC binding sites ; and ( ii ) high - level transcription of the S. typhimurium glnH promoter requires both 54 and NtrC , as measured by transcriptional glnHp - lacZ - fusions .
The E. coli glnH promoter has also been shown to contain an IHF binding site ; IHF facilitates contact between enhancerbound NtrC and promoter - bound 54 - holoenzyme ( 6 ) .
Although the defined IHF binding site in the E. coli glnH promoter and the corresponding sequence in the S. typhimurium glnH promoter share only 14 of 27 nucleotides , the consensus binding site for IHF is actually quite small ( WATCAAN 4 TTR , where W represents A or T and R represents A or G [ 7 , 20 , 33 ] ) , and the potential site in the S. typhimurium sequence has only one mismatch to the consensus .
A mutation in himD , which encodes the subunit of IHF , reduced glnH transcription only twofold under our assay conditions , and all strains carrying this mutation were highly attenuated regardless of glnA status .
Thus , himD mutations could not be used in combination with glnA deletions to independently assess the role of glnH transcription in compensating for the loss of glnA function during pathogenesis .
Interestingly , the subunit of IHF ( encoded by himA ) lies in an operon which was previously identified as being induced within the host during S. typhimurium pathogenesis ( 36 ) , and a polar mutation in this operon also causes attenuation of S. typhimurium .
S. typhimurium has a low - affinity glutamine transport system with a K m of 10 M , in addition to the high - affinity transport system , which has a K m of 0.2 M ( 4 ) ; hence , a glnA glnH mutant can grow in - vitro when supplemented with high levels of glutamine .
We presume the attenuation of the glnA glnH mutant ( as well as the glnA ntrA and glnA ntrC mutants ) is due to slow - growth within the host because of limiting amounts of glutamine .
As an example , the glnA1 mutant grows with the same doubling time ( 60 min ) in minimal NH 4 medium whether supplemented with 2 mM or 200 M glutamine .
This growth - rate is only slightly slower than that of the wild type in the same medium ( 55 min ) .
In contrast , glnA ntrA , ( glnAntrC ) , and glnA glnH strains grow more slowly in 200 M glutamine ( doubling times of 155 , 135 , and 160 min , respectively ) than in 2 mM glutamine ( doubling times of 110 , 90 , and 110 min , respectively ) .
The requirement for higher levels of glutamine to sustain faster growth of these three strains explains their virulence defect if in fact the level of glutamine available in animal tissues and fluids is low .
S. typhimurium is known to reside within the phagolysosome of macrophages , and macrophage survival is essential for virulence ( 3 , 12 ) .
Notably , the ( glnA - ntrC ) strain is defective for survival within J774 macrophages , similar to a strain carrying a mutation in the virulence - regulatory gene phoP which is known to cause a defect in macrophage survival .
An ntrA strain is similarly defective for macrophage survival , but this defect is completely overcome by an increase in glnA transcription with the addition of a glnAp356 mutation .
The growth - rate of S. typhimurium under nitrogen - limiting conditions is determined by the internal pool size of glutamine ( 21 ) , indicating that the defect in these strains is due to slow - growth caused by low internal levels of glutamine and thereby demonstrating that the phagolysosome of the cultured J774 macrophage is a lowglutamine environment .
If we extrapolate from these in - vitro results , we would predict that the phagolysosomes of host macrophages also contain low levels of glutamine , thus explaining the attenuation of strains with simultaneous defects in glutamine synthesis and high - affinity transport .
The phagolysosome containing S. typhimurium acidifies to a pH of 5.0 ( 1 ) .
Since glutamine is known to be acid labile , acidification of the phagolysosome may result in a decrease in available glutamine , making the phagolysosome particularly glutamine deficient .
Alternatively , glutamine may be actively excluded from the phagolysosome .
Harms et al. determined the amount of in - vivo free amino - acids within lysosomes of whole rat liver ( 17 ) but were unable to distinguish between glutamate and glutamine due to the acid lability of glutamine .
Thus , it remains to be determined whether all host compartments or just some important subset , like the phagolysosome , has such low levels of available glutamine that high - affinity transport is required to scavenge it .
54 is required for the transcription of virulence genes in a number of organisms .
In Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoeae , it transcribes pilin genes necessary for adherence to host epithelial cells ( 23 , 25 ) ; in Vibrio anguillarum , itis required for colonization of the fish host , which may be partially due to its required role in the motility of this organism ( 47 ) ; and in Vibrio cholerae , it is required for normal colonization and also for motility , which in turn probably plays a role in colonization and dissemination of this pathogen ( 26 ) .
Our results preclude the involvement of 54 in the transcription of any essential Salmonella virulence gene ; rather , the role of 54 in the pathogenesis of S. typhimurium is to coordinate the transcription of glutamine synthesis and high - affinity transport genes to ensure an adequate supply of this crucial amino - acid .
The only virulence defect of an ntrA strain was seen in a competition assay , and this effect was almost completely overcome in an ntrA glnAp356 strain , indicating that the only virulence defect in an ntrA strain is low glnA transcription .
The same effect was seen in intramacrophage survival ; an ntrA strain appears as defective for survival within the phagolysosome as a ( glnA - ntrC ) strain , which might suggest that an ntrA strain should be attenuated in a manner similar to a ( glnAntrC ) strain .
However , the ntrA strain showed no defect in an LD 50 assay , even though this strain is a glutamine auxotroph under laboratory conditions , suggesting that the secondary promoters upstream of the 54 - dependent promoters of glnA and glnH may be expressed at higher levels during in - vivo growth in the host .
Strains with the glnA mutation combined with mutations in either ntrC , ntrA , orglnH provided protection against subsequent challenge with wild - type S. typhimurium and show promise as live attenuated vaccine strains .
The ( glnA - ntrC ) mutation provided the best protection at both low and high doses when delivered both i.p. and perorally .
This type of metabolic attenuating mutation has the benefit of not affecting virulence gene expression , which may provide useful antigens for recognition by the immune system .
Moreover , although the glnA glnH strain needed to be inoculated in slightly higher doses for full protection against wild - type challenge , the ntr system is VOL .
65 , 1997 GLUTAMINE SYNTHESIS - TRANSPORT VIRULENCE REQUIREMENT 595 unaffected by these mutations and could be used to drive high - level transcription of heterologous antigens in a live vaccine strain simply by the provision of an ntr - regulated promoter .
In principle , attenuating an auxotroph by disrupting the transport mechanism needed to supply the auxotrophy could be a useful approach to developing vaccines for other pathogenic organisms .
The specific example of mutations affecting glutamine synthesis and high - affinity transport should be investigated in different organisms ( e.g. , intracellular and extracellular pathogens ) .
The general concept can be studied by constructing other biosynthesis - transport paired mutations or , alternatively , by disrupting transport genes in naturally occurring auxotrophic pathogens which rely on scavenging host nutrients .
