177 , No. 7 0021 - 9193/95 / $ 04.00 0 Characterization of a Second MetR - Binding Site in the metE metR Regulatory Region of Salmonella typhimurium WHI - FIN WU , MARK L. URBANOWSKI , AND GEORGE V. STAUFFER * Department of Microbiology , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa 52242 Transcription of the metE gene in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli is positively regulated by the MetR protein , with homocysteine serving as a coactivator .
It was shown previously that MetR binds to and protects from DNase I digestion a 24 - bp sequence in the metE metR regulatory region from nucleotides 48 to 71 relative to the metE transcription initiation site ( designated as site 1 ) .
In this study , we show that purified MetR protein also binds to and protects a second 24 - bp sequence adjacent to the original site , from nucleotides 24 to 47 relative to the metE transcription initiation site ( designated as site 2 ) .
Single and multiple base changes were introduced into sites 1 and 2 in a metE - lacZ fusion .
Base pair changes in site 1 or site 2 away from the MetR consensus binding sequence resulted in decreased metE - lacZ expression , suggesting that both sites are necessary for expression .
DNase I footprint analysis showed that MetR bound at the high - affinity site 1 enhances MetR binding at the low - affinity site 2 .
A 2 - bp change in site 2 toward the MetR consensus binding sequence resulted in high metE - lacZ expression ; the increased expression was MetR dependent but homocysteine independent .
Regulation of the genes that make up the met regulon of both Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli are under positive and/or negative control ( 17 , 18 ) .
Transcription of all the met genes , except metH , is negatively regulated by the MetJ repressor , with S - adenosylmethionine serving as a corepressor ( 17 , 18 ) .
Transcription of metE ( 3 , 14 , 29 ) , metA ( 12 ) , metF ( 7 ) , and metH ( 3 , 14 , 29 ) requires an activator , the MetR protein , for full expression .
The pathway intermediate homocysteine serves as a coregulator for MetR - mediated regulation of these genes and has a negative effect on metA and metH expression ( 4 , 12 , 28 ) and a positive effect on metE and metF expression ( 4 , 6 , 28 ) .
Homocysteine is the end product of the reactions catalyzed by the metA , metB , and metC gene products in the nonfolate branch of the pathway and serves as the acceptor for the methyl group donated by the folate branch of the pathway .
The role of homocysteine as coregulator for MetR - mediated activation may thus serve to balance the two branches of the methionine pathway .
The promoters for the metE and metR genes overlap and are divergently transcribed from a shared regulatory region ( 16 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
Previous genetic and biochemical data identified a binding site for MetR protein in the metE metR regulatory region ( site 1 in Fig. 1 ) that is necessary for MetR - mediated activation of the metE gene ( 27 ) .
We show here that a second MetR - binding site , with a lower affinity for MetR protein than that of site 1 , is located adjacent to site 1 and is also required for MetR - mediated activation of the metE gene ( designated as site 2 in Fig. 1 ) .
A possible model for these two binding sites in MetR - mediated activation of the metE gene is discussed .

pElac Rgal have been described previously ( 5 , 27 ) .
Plasmid pElac Ruid is isogenic to plasmid pElac Rgal except that it carries the promoterless uidA gene of E. coli ( 9 ) instead of the galK reporter gene at the NheI - EcoRI restriction sites .
Luria broth , Luria agar , and glucose minimal - medium ( GM ) have been described previously ( 24 ) .
GM was always supplemented with phenylalanine and vitamin - B 1 , since strains GS760 and GS762 carry the pheA905 and thi markers .
Supplements and antibiotics were added at the following concentrations ( in micrograms per milliliter ) : vitamin - B 1 , 1 ; ampicillin , 100 ; D - methionine , 50 ; and homocysteine , 100 .
Homocysteine was prepared as described previously ( 1 ) .
A 1.5 - kb EcoRI - BamHI DNA fragment containing the metE metR control region and the beginning of both structural genes was isolated from plasmid pElac Rgal ( 27 ) and ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of phage M13mp18 , designated M13mp18Elac Rgal .
Oligonucleotide - directed mutagenesis ( 10 ) was then used to construct mutations in the metE control region of the recombinant phage .
DNA sequence analysis was used to screen for the desired mutations .
Replicative - form DNA from each M13mp18Elac Rgal phage carrying a desired base change ( s ) was prepared , and the 1.5 - kb EcoRI - BamHI fragment carrying the mutation ( s ) was isolated and ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of plasmid pMC1403 ( 5 ) , creating in - frame fusions of codon 22 of the metE gene and codon 8 of the lacZ gene in plasmid pMC1403 .
The wild - type and mutant derivatives were then digested with StuI , ligated with EcoRI linkers , and cut with EcoRI .
The EcoRI DNA fragment of approximately 7 kb generated from each digestion carrying the metR - galK metE - lacZ fusion , along with the lacY and lacA genes , was isolated and cloned into the unique EcoRI site in the temperature - sensitive phage gt2 .
The same strategy was used to construct mutations with the pElac Ruid fusion plasmid .
Single mutations and one double mutation are designated by the base pair changes and their positions relative to the metE transcription start site .
Multiple changes were designated as follows : a 7 - bp change ( -55 C - 56C - 57T - 58T - 64A - 65G - 66G ) in site 1 away from the MetR consensus binding sequence was designated as allele 1 ( a1 ) , a 2 - bp change ( -34 T - 36A ) in site 2 toward the MetR consensus sequence was designated as allele 2 ( a2 ) , and a 6 - bp change ( -35 C - 37G - 43G - 44A - 45T - 46C ) in site 2 away from the MetR consensus sequence was designated as allele 3 ( a3 ) .
A mutant carrying both a1 and a2 ( -34 T - 36A - 55C - 56C - 57T - 58T - 64T - 65G - 66G ) , designated as allele 1,2 ( a1 ,2 ) , was made by PCR ( 19 ) .
Appropriate strains were lysogenized with the wild - type Elac Rgal or Elac Ruid phage or mutant derivatives by the procedure described previously ( 25 ) .
Lysogens were tested for the presence of a single copy of the prophage by infection with phage cI90c17 ( 23 ) .
All prophages carry the temperaturesensitive mutation cI857 , and therefore lysogens were grown at 30 C. DNase I footprinting assay .
The DNase I footprinting assay was based on the method of Schmitz and Galas ( 21 ) .
32 P - labeled DNA fragments carrying the metE - metR control region were used in the DNase I footprinting assay .
The labeled DNA fragments ( final concentration , about 150 pM ) were preincubated for 5 min at 37 C in90 lof1 transcription buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7.4 ] , 50 mM KCl , 8 mM MgCl 2 , 125 g of bovine serum albumin per ml ) with or without 2 mM D,L - homocysteine ( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo. ) , as indicated .
Twofold serial dilutions of purified MetR protein ( 2 ) were added in 10 l to the reaction 1834 VOL .
Nucleotide sequence and positions of base pair changes in MetR - binding sites 1 and 2 within the metE metR regulatory region .
Nucleotide numbering is that of Plamann and Stauffer ( 16 ) .
The transcriptional start sites and the 10 and 35 regions for metR and metE were determined previously ( 16 ) and are indicated on the top and bottom strands , respectively .
Three tandem repeats of the MetJ - binding sequence are indicated above the DNA sequence , and bases identical to the consensus sequence ( 5 - AGACGTCT - 3 ) are indicated by asterisks .
Site 1 is the region previously shown to be protected from DNase I digestion by bound MetR ( 27 ) .
Site 2 was shown in this study to be protected from DNase I digestion by bound MetR ( see Fig. 2 ) .
Base changes made by oligonucleotide - directed mutagenesis are shown below the sequence .
The allele designations are indicated to the left ( site 2 ) or right ( site 1 ) of the base changes .
The individual Elac Rgal and Elac Ruid phage derivatives constructed in this study carrying single - or multiple - base - pair changes are described in the text .
mixtures , and incubation was continued for an additional 20 min .
A 5 - l volume of DNase I ( 0.025 g / l in 20 mM sodium acetate [ pH 6.9 ] -- 32 mM CaCl 2 ) was then added to each reaction mixture , and incubation was continued for 30 s at 37 C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 25 l of stop solution ( 3 M ammonium acetate , 0.25 M EDTA , 15 g of sonicated calf thymus DNA per ml ) and precipitated with ethanol .
The partial DNase I digestion products were run on a DNA sequencing gel ( 11 ) adjacent to the Maxam - Gilbert ( 13 ) sequencing reactions of the labeled DNA fragments .
For quantitative analysis , the gels were either counted directly in a model 4000 scanner ( Ambis , San Diego , Calif. ) or autoradiographed at two different exposure times to ensure linearity and quantitated in the Ambis imager .
Representative bands in the regions corresponding to MetR - binding sites 1 and 2 were compared with samples with no MetR .
The percentage of protection from DNase I attack was calculated by dividing the difference in band intensity between the MetR lane and the no - MetR control lane by the intensity in the no - MetR lane .
The runoff transcription assay was performed in 25 l of the same transcription buffer used in the footprinting experiments with the addition of 50 g of heparin per ml and 200 M nucleoside triphosphates , following published procedures ( 22 ) , except that dithiothreitol was found to inhibit MetR activation and therefore was omitted .
Template DNA ( final concentration , 2 to 3 nM ) was allowed to bind to MetR protein in the presence or absence of 2 mM D,L - homocysteine .
E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme ( Epicentre , Madison , Wis. ) was then added to a final concentration of 20 nM , and incubation was continued for 30 min .
The four nucleoside triphosphates ( including [ 32 P ] UTP ) were then added in the presence of heparin , and incubation was continued for 15 min to allow one round of transcription to be completed .
Then 5 l of footprint stop mix was added , and the transcripts were ethanol precipitated and run on a 5 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel ( 11 ) .
The gel was dried and imaged on an Ambis 4000 scanner , and the bands corresponding to the metE transcript were quantitated .
- Galactosidase levels were measured as described by Miller ( 15 ) , using the chloroform - sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis procedure .
Assays were performed at least twice , and each sample was run in triplicate .
RESULTS Identification of a second MetR - binding site for metE .
Previous DNase I footprinting data identified a MetR - binding site in the S. typhimurium metE metR intergenic region located from nucleotides 48 to 71 relative to the metE transcription start site ( site 1 in Fig. 1 ) ( 27 ) .
In the original footprinting assay , a MetR - enriched cell extract was used as the source of the DNA - binding protein .
We repeated the DNase I footprinting assay with purified MetR protein ( 2 ) .
At a low concentration ( 7 nM dimer ) , the MetR protein protected a region from approximately positions 48 to 71 upstream of the metE transcription initiation site ( site 1 in Fig. 2 ) .
This is the same region identified previously with the MetR - enriched extract ( 27 ) .
At a higher concentration ( 58 nM dimer ) , MetR protected an additional region from about positions 24 to 47 upstream of 1 ( site 2 in Fig. 2 ) .
The location of site 2 relative to the metE transcription start site is shown in Fig. 1 .
Examination of the DNA sequence in site 2 revealed a putative MetR - binding sequence ( 5 - CGCA -- T -- TTCA - 3 ) , with 7 of 9 bp homologous to the consensus MetR - binding sequence ( 5 - TGAA -- T -- TTCA - 3 ) .
Effects of mutations in site 2 on metE - lacZ expression .
To determine whether site 2 is functionally important in MetRmediated activation of the metE gene , mutations were constructed in site 2 either toward or away from the MetR consensus sequence .
In one mutant , six bases were changed to create a random sequence at site 2 ( a3 ) .
Nucleotide changes were identified by DNA sequencing and are shown in Fig. 1 .
The mutated metE - lacZ - fusions were subcloned into phage gt2 as described previously ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Phages Elac Rgal - 40G , Elac Rgal - 44A , Elac Rgal - 46G , Elac Rgal - 35C - 37G , and Elac Ruid - a3 have changes away from the consensus sequence .
Phage Elac Rgal - a2 has a 2 - bp change toward the consensus sequence .
The mutant phage , along with the parent Elac Rgal phage and Elac Ruid phage , was used to lysogenize the metJ metB double - mutant strain GS760 .
This strain has low levels of homocysteine because of the metB mutation when grown in the presence of the limiting methionine source D - methionine ( 28 ) .
Thus , the effects of homocysteine on metE - lacZ expression can be determined by 1836 WU ET AL. .

DNase I footprinting assay of wild - type and a3 mutant DNA .
A 32 P - labeled 520 - bp ApaLI - BamHI DNA fragment carrying either the wild - type metE metR control region or the a3 mutant control region was incubated with purified MetR protein and subjected to partial DNase I digestion ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The digestion products were run alongside the A G ( lane 1 ) and C T ( lane 2 ) Maxam and Gilbert ( 13 ) DNA - sequencing reactions .
Lanes : 3 to 6 , wild - type DNA fragment with 0 , 7 , 19 , and 58 nM MetR protein dimer , respectively ; 7 to 10 , a3 mutant DNA fragment with 0 , 7 , 19 , and 58 nM MetR protein dimer , respectively .

adding homocysteine to the growth medium .
The metJ mutation prevents MetJ - mediated repression of the metE - lacZ fusion .
When the lysogens were grown in GM supplemented with D - methionine , lysogens 760 Elac Rgal - 40G , 760 Elac Rgal - 44A , 760 Elac Rgal - 46G , and 760 Elac Rgal - 35C - 37G showed 7 - to 18 - fold - decreased levels of - galactosidase compared with the parental lysogen 760 Elac Rgal ( Table 1 ) .
Although - galactosidase levels were induced in these lysogens by exogeneous homocysteine , the levels still remained two - to fourfold lower than the parental level .
Lysogen 760 Elac Rgal - a2 , where site 2 was changed toward the MetR consensus sequence , showed increased - galactosidase levels in D - methionine to nearly the fully induced levels seen with homocysteine addition ( Table 1 ) .
Since site 2 mutations away from the consensus sequence still allow high levels of - galactosidase in the presence of homocysteine , it is possible that the base pair changes do not eliminate binding of MetR at site 2 .
Therefore , we randomized the sequence at site 2 ( designated a3 ) and tested the effects of the mutation on metE - lacZ expression .
Since this mutation was constructed in the Elac Ruid fusion , we used the parent Elac Ruid phage as a control .
When lysogen 760 Elac Ruid - a3 was grown in GM supplemented with D - methionine , there was a 41 - fold decrease in - galactosidase levels and the addition of homocysteine had no effect ( Table 1 ) .
To demonstrate that MetR protein is able to bind to site 1 in the presence of the random site 2 mutation , we performed a DNase I footprint with the parental and mutant Elac Rgal - a3 DNAs as templates ( see Materials and Methods ) .
At low concentrations of MetR protein ( 7 and 19 nM dimer ) , site 1 was protected from DNase I digestion in both the wild - type and mutant DNA templates ( Fig. 2 , lanes 4 , 5 , 8 , and 9 ) .
As the concentration of MetR protein was increased to 58 nM dimer , site 2 of the wild - type DNA fragment was also protected from DNase I digestion whereas no protection of site 2 in the mutant fragment was observed ( lanes 6 and 10 ) .
Therefore , loss of metE - lacZ expression in lysogens carrying mutation a3 is probably due to the inability of MetR bound at site 1 alone to activate the metE - lacZ fusion , indicating that site 2 in the metE metR regulatory region is necessary for normal metE - lacZ expression .
Effects of the site 2 mutations in a metR background .
To confirm that the effects of the site 2 mutations on metE - lacZ expression are MetR dependent , the wild - type and mutant Elac Rgal and Elac Ruid phages were used to lysogenize the metR mutant strain GS762 .
Most of the mutant lysogens have - galactosidase levels similar to the levels in the parental lysogens ( Table 2 ) , suggesting that the effects of the mutations in site 2 are MetR dependent and do not directly affect metE promoter activity .
The - galactosidase level in lysogen 762 Elac Ruid - a3 , however , was decreased twofold compared with that in the control 762 Elac Ruid lysogen , and the nucleotide changes may have a small effect on the metE promoter as well as on MetR - mediated activation .
Quantitation of MetR affinity for sites 1 and 2 .
We used a quantitative DNase I footprint assay to determine the relative affinity difference of MetR for both binding sites on the wildtype control region and the effect of homocysteine on these parameters .
The equilibrium binding curves generated from these experiments are shown in Fig. 3A .

Analysis of the binding affinities of MetR protein for sites 1 and 2 on the wild - type and a1 mutant templates .
A 32 P - labeled NheI - BamHI DNA fragment containing the metE promoter was incubated with twofold serial dilutions of MetR protein and subjected to partial DNase I digestion .
The partial digestion products were sized on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel , and the amount of protection from DNase I attack by bound MetR was quantitated ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The percent protection is plotted against the logarithm of the MetR dimer concentration .
The concentrations of MetR that result in approximately 50 % protection are indicated by the arrows .

Symbols : F , site 1 , no homocysteine ; E , site 1 , plus homocysteine ; ■ , site 2 , no homocysteine ; , site 2 , plus homocysteine .
The results of in - vitro runoff transcription assays at 0 , 15 , and 100 nM MetR are indicated by the bar graphs above the corresponding values on the horizontal axis and are plotted as a percentage of transcription ( right vertical axis ) , with the value for 100 nM MetR plus homocysteine arbitrarily assigned as 100 % .
Solid bars , no homocysteine ; open bars , plus homocysteine .
( B ) MetR - binding curves for the a1 mutant promoter .
Symbols are the same as in panel A. DNase I attack ) shows that the affinity of MetR for site 1 is relatively high in both the absence and presence of homocysteine ( 6 and 4 nM , respectively ) .
In contrast , the affinity of MetR for site 2 is about 16 - fold less than for site 1 in the absence of homocysteine and is improved sevenfold by the addition of homocysteine ( midpoints at 100 and 14 nM , respectively ) .
In vitro runoff transcription reactions were performed with the wild - type DNA template , purified RNA polymerase , and purified MetR protein at the midpoint values of the binding curves for site 2 .
As shown by the bar graph in Fig. 3A , in the absence of MetR protein , no activation of transcription occurs either with or without homocysteine .
MetR can activate transcription when added at 15 nM but only in the presence of homocysteine .
As the concentration of MetR is raised to 100 nM , however , significant transcription occurs even in the absence of homocysteine and parallels the occupancy of site 2 by MetR .
Effects of the site 2 - up ( a2 ) mutation in the presence of a site 1 - down ( a1 ) mutation on metE - lacZ expression .
To determine whether the site 2 - up mutant is dependent on a functional site 1 for MetR - mediated activation , a double mutant carrying both the a1 and a2 mutations was constructed ( see Materials and Methods ) .
We first tested the effects of the site 1 - down mutation alone on metE - lacZ expression .
Phage Elac Ruid - a1 and the parent phage Elac Ruid were used to lysogenize the metB metJ strain GS760 .
The lysogens were grown in GM supplemented with D - methionine or D - methionine plus homocysteine , and - galactosidase levels were measured .
The - galactosidase levels of the mutant lysogen were decreased about fivefold in the presence of D - methionine compared with the parent lysogen ( Table 3 ) .
As expected , addition of homocysteine to the growth medium increased - galactosidase levels in the parent lysogen .
However , homocysteine had the opposite effect on the mutant lysogen , decreasing - galactosidase levels an additional 3.9 - fold .
Although homocysteine functions as a coactivator for the wild - type metE - lacZ fusion ( Tables 1 and 3 ) , it has been shown previously that homocysteine represses metR expression ( 26 ) ; it is possible that the decrease in metElacZ expression in the site 1 - down mutant is due to insufficient MetR protein .
To determine whether the remaining metE - lacZ expression in the a1 mutant is MetR dependent , the parent and mutant phages were used to lysogenize the metR mutant strain GS762 .
The lysogens were grown in GM supplemented with D - methionine , and - galactosidase levels were measured ( Table 3 ) .
The mutant lysogen had - galactosidase levels similar to those in the parental lysogen , suggesting that the residual metE - lacZ expression in the a1 mutant is MetR dependent and that the a1 mutation does not directly affect the metE promoter .
An in - vitro DNase I footprinting assay was performed with the parental and a1 mutant DNAs as templates to determine whether the MetR - dependent residual metE - lacZ expression in the site 1 mutant was dependent on MetR bound at site 2 alone or whether residual binding of MetR at site 1 also occurs ( Fig. 3B ) .
Site 1 of the mutant DNA was not protected from DNase I digestion at any concentration of MetR tested , suggesting that the metE - lacZ expression observed in the a1 mutant is due to MetR protein bound solely to site 2 .
In the absence of homocysteine , site 2 of the mutant DNA template was protected only at very high MetR concentrations ; the emergence of nonspecific partial protection outside of sites 1 and 2 at these levels of MetR precluded determination of an 1838 WU ET AL. .
In vitro transcription assay of the wild - type and homocysteine - independent a1 ,2 mutant promoters .
NheI - BamHI DNA fragments carrying either the wild - type or the a1 ,2 mutant promoters were used as templates for runoff transcriptions with purified RNA polymerase and MetR and either with or without homocysteine .
The transcripts were run on denaturing polyacrylamide gels ( see Materials and Methods ) .
MetR protein dimer was added , where indicated ( ) , to 15 nM ; homocysteine was added , where indicated ( ) , to 2 mM ; RNA polymerase was present in all samples at 20 nM .
Lanes : 1 to 4 , wild - type template ; 5 to 8 , a1 ,2 mutant template .
The addition of homocysteine reproducibly increased the affinity of MetR for site 2 even in the absence of binding at site 1 .
We next tested the effects of the site 2 - up mutation in the presence of the site 1 - down mutation on metE - lacZ expression .
The Elac Ruid - a1 ,2 phage was used to lysogenize strain GS760 , the lysogen was grown in GM in the presence of D - methionine or D - methionine plus homocysteine , and - galactosidase levels were measured .
As shown in Table 3 , the - galactosidase levels in the mutant lysogen were increased compared with those in the control lysogen 760 Elac Ruid when grown in GM supplemented with D - methionine ; the addition of homocysteine decreased the - galactosidase levels about twofold in the mutant lysogen .
To show that the high levels of metE - lacZ expression in the a1 ,2 double mutant are due to MetR - mediated activation rather than the result of promoter - up mutations , the mutant phage was used to lysogenize the metR strain GS762 .
The lysogen was grown in GM plus D - methionine , and - galactosidase levels were measured .
The control lysogen Elac Ruid and the mutant lysogen had about the same low levels of - galactosidase , demonstrating that the mutations do not have a significant effect on promoter activity ( Table 3 ) .
The in - vivo results were supported by results of in - vitro - transcription runoff experiments in which the a1 ,2 mutant DNA template showed high MetR - dependent transcription in the presence or absence of homocysteine even at a low MetR concentration ( 15 nM ) ( Fig. 4 , lanes 7 and 8 ) ; at this low MetR concentration , homocysteine is required for the transcription of the wild - type template ( lanes 3 and 4 ) .
These results indicate that site 1 is dispensable for metE - lacZ expression in the presence of the site 2 - up mutation .
DISCUSSION The data presented above demonstrate the presence of two MetR - binding sites in the metE metR regulatory region of S. typhimurium .
Site 1 has a 9 - of - 9-bp match with the consensus MetR - binding sequence , and site 2 has a 7 - of - 9-bp match with the consensus MetR - binding sequence ( Fig. 1 ) .
Site 2 also has a lower affinity for MetR than does site 1 ( Fig. 3A ) .
Previous results showed that mutations in site 1 decreased MetR - mediated activation of metE - lacZ expression ( 27 ) .
The data presented here demonstrate that mutations in either site 1 or site 2 away from the consensus sequence decrease MetR - mediated activation of metE - lacZ expression ( Table 1 ) .
Therefore , both sites are necessary for normal metE - lacZ expression .
Two lines of evidence suggest that site 2 might be the site from which activation occurs .
First , when site 2 was randomized , there was a dramatic decrease in metE - lacZ expression ( Table 1 ) .
Since the DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrated that site 1 in this mutant is protected from DNase I digestion at the same concentration of MetR protein required for protection of site 1 in the wild - type DNA fragment ( Fig. 2 ) , it is likely that site 1 is occupied by MetR in the mutant lysogen in - vivo .
Thus , MetR protein bound at site 1 alone is probably not sufficient for metE - lacZ expression .
Second , a mutant with site 1 randomized and a wild - type site 2 showed low but significant - galactosidase levels in the metR strain ( GS760 ) compared with a metR strain ( GS762 ) grown in GM medium supplemented with D - methionine ( Table 3 ) .
An in - vitro DNase I footprint assay showed that in the random site 1 mutant , MetR protein bound and protected only site 2 from DNase I attack ( Fig. 3B ) .
Thus , residual MetR - mediated activation of the metE - lacZ fusion in this lysogen is probably due to MetR bound exclusively at the wild - type site 2 .
MetR is a member of a large family of bacterial activator proteins , termed LysR - type transcriptional regulators , which share amino - acid sequence homology and domain structure ( 8 , 20 ) .
The structure of the metE promoter region proposed here , in which a high - affinity MetR - binding site enhances binding of MetR at a low - affinity promoter - proximal activation site , is similar to the arrangement found in many of the promoters whose transcription is activated by LysR - type regulators .
However , this dual - site arrangement is not seen for the metH promoter , in which a single MetR site effects activation ( 2 ) .
It is interesting that when site 2 in the metE promoter is changed to a consensus MetR - binding site , metE - lacZ expression is not only independent of a functional site 1 but also essentially independent of the coactivator homocysteine both in - vivo ( Tables 1 and 3 ) and in - vitro ( Fig. 4 ) .
If the cell is to respond to the level of homocysteine for metE activation , there can not be a consensus sequence at site 2 , because this would allow homocysteine - independent activation ( as seen for the a2 mutant ) .
Arranging site 2 as a nonconsensus site , while making MetR - mediated activation of metE homocysteine dependent , also decreases the affinity of site 2 for MetR .
Thus , site 1 might be necessary to enhance MetR binding to site 2 by allowing MetR bound at site 1 to affect proteinprotein interaction or by causing DNA structure changes ; alternatively , site 1 may function by helping maintain a high local concentration of MetR near site 2 .
