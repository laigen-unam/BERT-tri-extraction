Typhimurium Matthew R Evans 1,4 , Ryan C Fink 1,5 , Andres Vazquez - Torres 2 , Steffen Porwollik 3 , Jessica Jones - Carson 2 , Michael McClelland 3 , Hosni M Hassan 1 * Open Access Abstract Background : Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) is a Gram - negative pathogen that must successfully adapt to the broad fluctuations in the concentration of dissolved dioxygen encountered in the host .
In Escherichia coli , ArcA ( Aerobic Respiratory Control ) helps the cells to sense and respond to the presence of dioxygen .
The global role of ArcA in E. coli is well characterized ; however , little is known about its role in anaerobically grown S. Typhimurium .
Results : We compared the transcriptional profiles of the virulent wild - type ( WT ) strain ( ATCC 14028s ) and its isogenic arcA mutant grown under anaerobic conditions .
We found that ArcA directly or indirectly regulates 392 genes ( 8.5 % of the genome ) ; of these , 138 genes are poorly characterized .
Regulation by ArcA in S. Typhimurium is similar , but distinct from that in E. coli .
Thus , genes/operons involved in core metabolic pathways ( e.g. , succinyl - CoA , fatty acid degradation , cytochrome oxidase complexes , flagellar biosynthesis , motility , and chemotaxis ) were regulated similarly in the two organisms .
However , genes/operons present in both organisms , but regulated differently by ArcA in S. Typhimurium included those coding for ethanolamine utilization , lactate transport and metabolism , and succinate dehydrogenases .
Salmonella - specific genes/operons regulated by ArcA included those required for propanediol utilization , flagellar genes ( mcpAC , cheV ) , Gifsy - 1 prophage genes , and three SPI - 3 genes ( mgtBC , slsA , STM3784 ) .
In agreement with our microarray data , the arcA mutant was non - motile , lacked flagella , and was as virulent in mice as the WT .
Additionally , we identified a set of 120 genes whose regulation was shared with the anaerobic redox regulator , Fnr .
Conclusion ( s ) : We have identified the ArcA regulon in anaerobically grown S. Typhimurium .
Our results demonstrated that in S. Typhimurium , ArcA serves as a transcriptional regulator coordinating cellular metabolism , flagella biosynthesis , and motility .
Furthermore , ArcA and Fnr share in the regulation of 120 S. Typhimurium genes .
Background Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) is a Gram - negative intracellular pathogen that causes gastroenteritis in the human host .
Although non life - threatening in healthy adults , it can be fatal for children and immunocompromised individuals .
The infection proceeds via two main stages : invasion and systemic infection .
During the invasion stage , the pathogen adheres and colonizes the intestines gaining access to the epithelial cells .
Subsequently , Salmonella crosses the epithelial cells and gets internalized by the * Correspondence : 1 Department of Microbiology , North Carolina State University , Raleigh , North Carolina 27695 - 7615 USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article macrophages where it reproduces and stealthily spreads in the host and causes systemic infection [ 1 - 4 ] .
Clearly , Salmonella must adapt quickly to the diverse environments it encounters .
In fact , from the gastrointestinal tract to the intracellular milieu , it is challenged with fluctuations in oxygen concentration and with numerous host - immune defenses including a battery of reactive oxygen ( ROS ) and nitrogen species ( RNS ) and antimicrobial peptides that reduce its ability to colonize the host [ 1 - 4 ] .
In Escherichia coli , ArcA ( Aerobic Respiratory Control ) is one of the main transcriptional regulators involved in the metabolic shift from anaerobic to aerobic conditions and controlling the enzymatic defenses of bacteria against ROS .

BMC Microbiology 2011 , 11:58 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/11/58 Page 2 of 16 regulator of a two - component global regulatory system , ArcA/ArcB , where ArcB is a transmembrane histidine kinase sensor .
ArcB transfers a phosphoryl group to ArcA , activating it , and inducing or repressing a large and diverse number of operons including the tricarboxylic acid cycle ( TCA ) , terminal oxidases , dehydrogenases of the flavoprotein class , the glyoxylate shunt , and fatty acid degradation [ 5 - 17 ] .
Due to its importance in diverse energy metabolic processes , the ArcA regulon has been thoroughly characterized in E. coli [ 5,12,18 ] .
Conversely , very little is known about the regulatory network controlled by ArcA in S. Typhimurium under anaerobic conditions .
Although E. coli and S. Typhimurium share a very high genomic similarity ( ~ 75 - 80 % ) [ 19 ] , we previously discovered that the Fnr ( Fumarate Nitrate Reductase ) regulon of S. Typhimurium is markedly different from the one identified in E. coli [ 20 ] .
Due to the complementary roles of ArcA and Fnr in the regulation of cellular metabolism and adaptation to changes in redox , we hypothesized that the ArcA regulon of S. Typhimurium will also differ from that of E. coli .
The results indicate that in S. Typhimurium , as in E. coli , theArcA regulon includes the core metabolic and energy functionsaswellasmotility.However,Salmonella - specific genes/operons regulated by ArcA include newly identified flagellar genes ( mcpAC , cheV ) , Gifsy - 1 prophage genes , a few SPI - 3 genes ( mgtBC , slsA , STM3784 ) , and those for propanediol utilization .
Furthermore , the arcA mutant was non - motile and was as virulent as the isogenic wild - type strain .
We also identified 120 genes that were regulated by the anaerobic regulator , Fnr , as well as by ArcA .
Methods Bacterial strains and growth - conditions The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Wild - type ( WT ) S. Typhimurium ( 14028s ) and its isogenic arcA mutant ( NC 980 ) were used throughout .
P22 phage was used to move the arcA : : Tn10 mutation from S. Typhimurium LT2 ( TT17442 ) [ 21 ] to strain 14028 s. Transductants were plated on Evans Blue Uranine ( EBU ) agar and the arcA mutant was tested for its inability to grow on toluidine - blue agar [ 22 ] .
The Tn10 insertion junctions of the arcA mutant were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing .
Additionally , the absence of the ArcA protein in the mutant was confirmed by Western blotting ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1 - lane 3 ) .
Unless stated otherwise , the WT and the arcA mutant were grown anaerobically at 37 °C in MOPS - buffered ( 100 mM , pH 7.4 ) LB broth supplemented with 20 mM D - xylose ( LB - MOPS - X ) .
MOPS was used in the medium to avoid the indirect effects of pH , while xylose was used to avoid the effects of catabolite - repression [ 12 ] .
An anaerobic chamber ( Coy , Ann Harbor , MI ) with anaerobic gas mixture ( 10 % H 2 ,5 % CO 2 , and 85 % N 2 ) was used as previously described [ 20 ] .
All solutions were anaerobically pre - equilibrated in the chamber for 48 h before use .
Overnight cultures ( 15 - 18 h ) were used to inoculate fresh media .
Aerobic growth was carried - out using LB or LB - MOPS - X as specified ( volume of the culture : flask ratio = 1:5 , shaking at 200 rpm using an orbital shaker ) .
Growth kinetic experiments were performed on the WT and the arcA mutant in triplicate under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .
Construction of parcA For complementation studies , a low - copy - number plasmid , expressing arcA ( parcA , NC989 ) wasconstructed .
The complete arcA sequence starting from 180 bp upstream from the start codon ( ATG ) until the stop codon ( TAA ) of arcA [ i.e. , 897 bp fragment ] was amplified from the WT strain using the following primers ( Integrated DNA Technologies , Coralville , IA ) : arcA - Forward 5 ' - TCGATCCCGGGTACCCACGAC CAAGCTAATG - 3 ' and arcA - Reverse 5 ' - CTACCT CCCGGGTTAATCCTGCAGGTCGCCG -3 ' [ SmaI site underlined ] .
The PCR product was digested with SmaI and ligated into the pACYC177 ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) vector that was also cut with SmaI .
Thus , in the new plasmid ( parcA ) the Kan r gene in pACYC177 was disrupted by the insertion of arcA .
PlasmidDNA ( parcA ) was first transformed into a restriction deficient strain of E. coli [ ER2925 ( New England BioLabs ) ] , which was subsequently purified and transformed into and maintained in the S. Typhimurium arcA mutant , thus generating NC989 ( Table 1 ) .
Transformations were carried - out using the calcium chloride method [ 23 ] .
Plasmid DNA and genomic DNA were isolated using the Qiagen Mini Spin isolation kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) and the DNAeasy Tissue Kit ( Qiagen ) , respectively .
Transformants containing parcA ( NC989 ) were confirmed for Amp r ( 130 μg/ml ) and Kan s ( 50 μg/ml ) on LB plates and the presence of parcA was confirmed via PCR and restriction analysis .
The expression of ArcA was confirmed by Western blot analysis ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1 - lane 4 ) .
RNA isolation Overnight anaerobic cultures of the WT or the arcA mutant were used to inoculate three independent flasks for each strain .
Every flask contained 150 ml of LB - MOPS - X equilibrated in the anaerobic gas mix for the previous 48 h .
The three independent cultures of each strain were grown to an OD 600 = 0.30 - 0.35 , pooled , and treated with RNAlater ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) to fix the cells and preserve the quality of the RNA .
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy RNA extraction kit ( Qiagen ) Evans et al. .

Phage P22 S. Libby/Collection stock of NC and the samples were treated with RNase - free DNase ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) .
The absence of contaminating DNA and the quality of the RNA was confirmed by the lack of PCR amplification of known genes ( i.e. : fnr ) and by using agarose - gel electrophoresis .
Aliquots of the RNA samples were kept at -80 °C for use in the microarray and the qRT - PCR studies .
Microarray studies S. Typhimurium microarray slides were prepared and used as previously described [ 24 ] .
For the hybridizations , the SuperScript ™ Indirect cDNA Labeling System ( Invitrogen ) was used to synthesize the cDNA from the RNA prepared from the WT and arcA mutant strains .
Dye swapping was performed to avoid dye - associated effects on cDNA synthesis .
Slide hybridizations and scanning were carried - out using the same protocols and equipment as previously described [ 20 ] .
Data analysis Cy3 and Cy5 values for each spot were normalized over the total intensity for each dye , to account for differences in total intensity between the two scanned images .
The consistency of the data obtained from the microarray analysis was evaluated using two methods : ( i ) a pair - wise comparison , calculated with a two - tailed Student 's t test andanalyzedbytheMEANandTTESTproceduresof SAS - STAT statistical software ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) [ the effective degrees of freedom for the t test were calculated as previously described [ 25 ] ; and ( ii ) a regularized t test followed by a posterior probability of differential expression [ PPDE ( p ) ] method .
The signal intensity at each spot from the arcA mutant and the WT were background - subtracted , normalized , and used to calculate the ratio of gene expression between the two strains .
All replicas were combined and the median expression ratio and standard deviations calculated for ORFs showing ≥ 2.5 - fold change .
Microarray data The microarray data are accessible via GEO Accession Number GSE24564 at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ query/acc.cgi ?
qRT - PCR qRT - PCR [ 26 ] was used to validate the microarray data [ 27 ] .
Seventeen genes were randomly chosen ( Table 2 ) from the differentially expressed genes .
Primers ( Integrated DNA Technologies , Coralville , IA ) were designed and qRT - PCRs were carried - out using QuantiTectTM SYBR ® Green RT - PCR Kit ( Qiagen ) , an iCycler ™ ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) , and the data were analyzed by the Bio - Rad Optical System Software - Version 3.1 , according to the manufacturer specifications .

To ensure accurate quantification of the mRNA levels , three amplifications of each gene were made using 1:5:25 dilutions of the total RNA .
Measured mRNA levels were normalized to the mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene , rpoD ( s - 70 ) .
Normalized values were used to calculate the ratios of the expression levels [ 20 ] in the arcA mutant relative to the WT .
Logo graph and promoter analysis The information matrix for the generation of the ArcA logo was produced using the alignment of the E. coli ArcA binding sequences , available at http://arep.med .
The alignment of the ArcA motifs from this website did not include the motifs present in the sodA and mutM promoters [ 29,30 ] , therefore they were included in our analysis .
To account for differences in nucleotide usage or slight variations in consensus sequences , a second alignment was built for S. Typhimurium using the 5 ' - regions of the homologous genes originally used to build the E. coli information matrix .
The Salmonella alignment was used to prepare a new information matrice using the Patser software ( version 3d ) , available at http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/ rsat / [ 31 ] and graphed using the Weblogo software ( version 2.8.1 , 2004 - 10 - 18 ) , available at http://weblogo .
Swarming motility assay and electron microscopy The swarming of the WT and the arcA mutant were evaluated under anoxic conditions .
Ten microliters of anaerobically grown cells ( i.e. , from 16 h cultures ) were spotted onto LB - MOPS - X agar ( 0.6 % agar ) plates and incubated anaerobically at 37 °C for 24 h .
The diameter of the growth halo was used as a measure of swarming .
Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) was used to examine the morphology of the extracellular surfaces , while transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and negative staining were used to visualize the flagella of the anaerobically grown WT and arcA mutant as previously described [ 20 ] .
Pathogenicity studies For single infectionassays , six to eight week old female C57BL/6 mice bred in the University of Colorado School of Medicine animal facility according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines were used in this study .
WT and arcA mutant Salmonella were grown in LB - MOPS - X broth to stationary - phase for about 20 h. For intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) challenge , two groups of five mice per strain ( WT and arcA mutant ) were inoculated with 250 CFU in 500 μl PBS/mouse .
Mortality was scored over a 15 - to 30 - day period .
Competitive infection assays were carried - out as described [ 33 ] with modifications .
The strains were separately grown overnight in LB broth at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm .
Tetracycline ( 10 μg/ml ) was used to propagate and isolate the arcA mutant .
Bacterial ( i. e. : WT and arcA mutant ) cultures were diluted in phosphatebuffered saline ( PBS ) and mixed to produce a 1:1 inoculum ratio .
Groups of mice were infected either i.p. or orally ( p.o. ) .
Prior to oral infection , food and water were withheld from the mice for 4 h and the bacterial cocktail was administered to the mice by allowing them to drink 20 μl from the end of a pipette tip .
On day 4 or day 6 after i.p. or p.o. infection , respectively , mice were euthanized and mesenteric lymph nodes ( MLN ) , liver and spleen collected for bacterial enumeration .
The tissues were homogenized in sterile PBS and 10 - fold serial dilutions were plated on LB agar medium with or without 10 μg/mL tetracycline to distinguish the WT ( Tet s ) fromthearcA mutant ( Tet r ) .
The number of CFUs of S. Typhimurium 14028 s per organ was calculated by subtracting the number of CFU/ml on the LB - Tet plates from the number of CFU / ml on the corresponding LB plates .
The competitive index ( CI ) was calculated as the ratio of the CFU of arcA mutant to the CFU of the WT strain recovered from the spleen , liver , and mesenteric lymph nodes ( i.e. ; CI = [ arcA mutant/WT ] output / [ arcA mutant/WT ] input ) .
Results Bacterial growth kinetics The growth kinetics of the WT and the arcA mutant strains were determined under anaerobic conditions in LB - MOPS - X .
The arcA mutant strain grew at a slower rate than the WT strain .
The doubling - times of the WT and arcA mutant were 37.0 ± 0.4 and 55.4 ± 0.1 min under anaerobic conditions .
Due to the difference in the doubling - times of the two strains , cells used for RNA isolation and subsequent transcriptome profiling were allowed to grow for an equal number of generations ( ~ five generations : OD 600 = 0.30 - 0.35 ) instead of an equal length of time .
Anaerobic transcriptome profiling Outof4,579genes,thetwo - tailedStudent 's t test , produced a set of 2,026 coding sequences showing a significant difference between the arcA mutant and the WT ( p < 0.05 ) .
We restricted the analyses to only include highly affected genes ( i.e. , has a ratio ≥ 2.5 - fold ) as previously described [ 20 ] .
Under this constraint , 392 genes were differentially expressed in the arcA mutant relative to the WT and , therefore , regulated directly or indirectly Evans et al. .
BMC Microbiology 2011 , 11:58 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/11/58 Page 6 of 16 by ArcA .
Of these , 147 genes were up - regulated and 245 genes were down - regulated ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
All the genes showing significant differential expression were classified into clusters of orthologous groups ( COGs ) [ 34 - 36 ] as defined by the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) http://www.ncbi.nlm .
It should be noted that throughout the study we compared the levels of transcription in the arcA mutant to that in the WT strain .

c Bolded functional gene catagories contain a summary of the unbolded COG functional gene groups that are located in each of the previous lines .
( i.e. , > 1 ) , while genes activated by ArcA have negative values ( i.e. , < 1 ) .
Microarray validation Normalized mRNA levels from qRT - PCR are shown in Table 2 .
The microarray and qRT - PCR data were log 2 transformed and plotted ( Figure 1 ) .
The correlation between the two sets of data was 0.87 ( p < 0.05 ) .
Logo graph and promoter analysis To determine whether a binding site for ArcA might be present in the region upstream of the candidate ArcAregulated genes , we searched the 5 ' regions of these highly affected genes ( i.e. , has a ratio ≥ ± 2.5 - fold ) for the presence of a putative ArcA - binding motif using a Salmonella logo graph ( Figure 2 ) and found 155 genes contained potential ArcA binding sites .
Furthermore , fifty - five out of the 147 ArcA - activated genes ( 37 % ) , and 100 out of the 245 ArcA - repressed genes ( 41 % ) contained at least one putative ArcA - binding site ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
ArcA as a repressor Transcription of the genes required for aerobic metabolism , energy generation , amino - acid transport , and fatty acid transport were anaerobically repressed by ArcA ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
In particular , the genes required for cytochrome - o-oxidase , succinyl - CoA synthetase , glutamate/aspartate transport , trehalose - 6 - phosphate biosynthesis , long - chain - fatty - acids transport , spermidine/putrescine transport , dipeptide transport , the genes encoding the two - component tricarboxylic transport system and the site - specific DNA factor for inversion stimulation ( fis ) wereamongthehighestrepressed by ArcA .
Genes required for L - lactate transport and metabolism , phosphate transport , acetyl - CoA transferase , APC family/D - alanine/D - serine / glycine transport , putative cationic amino - acid transporter , peptide methionine - sulfoxide reductase , multiple antibiotic resistance operon , as well as many poorly characterized genes were also repressed by ArcA ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .

Typhimurium [ 41 ] , and genes coding for a leucinerich repeat protein ( sspH2 ) that is translocated by and coordinately regulated with the SPI - 2 TTSS [ 42 ] were highly repressed by ArcA ( Figure 3A and Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .

NR = no expression ratio .
ArcA as an activator Several of the genes involved in regulating flagellar biosynthesis , motility , chemotaxis , sugar transport , metabolism , and glycogen biosynthesis were found to be anaerobically activated by ArcA ( Figure 3D - F and Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
In particular , several of the middle ( class 2 ) flagellar genes and late flagellar ( class 3 ) genes had lower transcript levels in the arcA mutant than in the WT strain ( Figure 3D - F ) .
There was no significant difference in the transcript levels of the early flagellar genes ( class 1 ) flhD and flhC , whose gene products FlhD / FlhC are the master regulators of flagellar biosynthesis ( Figure 3E ) .
Additionally , several newly identified flagellar genes [ 43 ] ( i. e. , mcpA , mcpC , andcheV ) hadlower Evans et al. .

Furthermore , genes coding for transcriptional repressor CytR , nitrite reductase , 2 - dexoyribose - 5-phosphate aldolase , thymidine phosphorylase , lysine/cadaverine transport protein , putrescine / ornithine antiporter , ornithine decarboxylase , ethanolamine operon , and propanediol operon as well as its transcriptional regulator PocR were activated by ArcA ( Figure 3B and 3C , and Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
The expression of SPI - 1 associated genes was not affected by a mutation in arcA .
However,twoSPI - 3 genes , slsA , encoding a putative inner membrane protein required for colonization of chickens and calves [ 1,44 ] , and STM3784 , a putative sugar phosphotransferase , were activated by ArcA as their expression levels were significantly lower in the mutant than in the WT ( Figure 3A and Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
Phenotype of the arcA mutant Next , wecorrelatedsomeofthemicroarrayfindings with the corresponding phenotypes of the WT and the arcA mutant strains .
a. Flagellar biosynthesis and swarming motility The microarray data showed that , in anaerobiosis , the expression of the flagellar biosynthesis , motility , and chemotaxis genes was lower in the arcA mutant than in the WT .
Therefore , we compared the swarming motility of the WT and the arcA mutant in soft agar under anaerobic conditions ( Table 4 ) .
The data indicated that the arcA mutant was ~ 100 % non - motile compared to the WT and that the inclusion of parcA complemented ( ~ 57 % ) this phenotype .
We also compared the WT and the arcA mutant under anaerobic conditions for the presence of flagella by using SEM ( Figure 4A and 4C , left panel ) and TEM ( Figure 4B and 4D , right panel ) .
The data ( Table 4 and Figure 4 ) clearly showed that the arcA mutant Lacked flagella and was non - motile .
b. Virulence in mice The microarray data ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) showed that ArcA does not significantly regulate the transcription of the virulence genes found in SPI - 1 , which are important for the ability of Salmonella to invade host epithelial cells [ 2,3,45 - 47 ] .
However , few Table 4 Effect of the arcA mutation on swarming motility under anaerobic conditions Diameter ( cm ) Genotype Anaerobic a % b WT 8.0 ± 0.1 100 arcA mutant 0.0 ± 0.0 0 Mutant/parcA 4.6 ± 0.1 57 a Average of three replicates .
b Percent relative to the wild - type ( WT ) .
virulence genes related to SPI - 2 ( sspH2 ) andSPI - 3 ( mgtCB , slsA , STM3784 ) were affected by ArcA .
Therefore , to evaluate these findings , we tested the virulence of the arcA mutant in a murine model of mucosal and acute infection using immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice .
The arcA mutant was as virulent as the WT strain when 250 CFU/mouse were inoculated via i.p. ( Figure 5A ) .
Since intramacrophage survival and replication of Salmonella permits the colonization of the spleen and liver of mice [ 4,48 ] , a further virulence comparison of the WT and the arcA mutant was performed using a mixed infection assay .
The data showed that the arcA mutant had a moderate competitive survival advantage in the reticuloendothelial system compared to the WT in all systemic organs examined following a p.o. or i.p. mixed infection ( Figure 5B ) .
In the majority of the mice , the arcA mutant was isolated in higher numbers than the WT , although these increases were not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 ) .
The data generated with the competitive assays is in agreement with i.p. infection data , where the mice succumbed with similar kinetics after infection with arcA or WT bacteria .
Discussion Although there are several reports on the regulation of specific genes by ArcA in non - virulent strains of E. coli [ 6 - 9,13 - 17,49 - 56 ] and in Salmonella spp. [ 57 ] .
This is thefirstgenome - widestudyontheregulatoryroleof ArcA in S. Typhimurium ( 14028s ) under anaerobic conditions .
ArcA was found to directly or indirectly control the expression of at least 392 genes .
In particular , we showed that ArcA is involved in energy metabolism , flagella biosynthesis , and motility .
Additionally , the arcA mutant was as virulent as the WT , although it was nonmotile .
Furthermore , prior to the present report , none of the virulence genes ( i. e. , SPI - 3 and Gifsy - 1 ) had been identified as part of the Salmonella ArcA regulon .
Finally , several genes involved in metabolism previously identified as being regulated by ArcA in E. coli [ 5 - 17,49 - 52 ] were also identified in the present study ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
Logo comparison In a recent study , a logo was used to graphically compare multiple ArcA sequence alignments of Shewanella oneidensis [ 58 ] to that of E. coli [ 12 ] .
The analysis revealed subtle changes in base pairs at each position between the sequences .
Although the ArcA binding motifs of S. oneidensis and E. coli were similar , the arcA regulons and the physiological function of ArcA in these two organisms were different [ 58 ] .
When comparing the ArcA logos of E. coli and S. oneidensis to the one generated herein for S. Typhimurium , we found that there is similarity between S. Typhimurium and both E. coli and S. Evans et al. .
BMC Microbiology 2011 , 11:58 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/11/58 Page 10 of 16 A B C Figure 4 Comparison of the WT and the arcA mutant for surface appendages and flagella via microscopy .
Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) was used to evaluate the WT ( A ) and the arcA mutant ( C ) for the presence/absence of surface appendages and negative staining followed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) was used to evaluate the WT ( B ) and the arcA mutant ( D ) for the presence/absence of flagella .
Cells were grown anaerobically in LB - MOPS - X media and the samples were prepared as described in Materials and Methods .
However , while there is very little variation between the nucleotide sequences at each base pair of S. Typhimurium and E. coli , there is much more variation between S. TyphimuriumandS .
Therefore , when comparing the genes regulated by ArcA in these three organisms , it is evident that the ArcA regulons of E. coli and S. Typhimurium are more similar than that of S. oneidensis .
ArcA and carbon metabolism Comparing our microarray data in S. Typhimurium to the published data of E. coli [ 5,12 ] , there are several aspects pertaining to metabolic regulation that are similar between these two organisms .
Anaerobically , several ArcA - repressed genes identified in our microarray data are involved in metabolism and transport , while ArcAactivated genes included those coding for enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and catabolism as well as those for gluconeogenesis .
Expression of many of these genes was consistent with those reported in E. coli [ 5,9,11 - 14,52 ] , H. influenzae [ 59 ] , and S. oneidensis [ 60 ] .
The genes of the two - component tricarboxylic transport system ( tctE , STM2786 , STM2787 , STM2788 , and STM2789 ) were the most highly repressed by ArcA ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
This was not surprising since transport systems for substrates of aerobic pathways have been suggested to be candidates for regulation by ArcA [ 14 ] .
A similar pattern of anaerobic regulation of these enzymes has also been seen in our previous global analysis of Fnr [ 20 ] ( Additional file 1 : Table S2 ) .
In E. coli , the CsrA ( carbon storage regulator ) protein acts post - transcriptionally to balance carbon flow in the cell by activating genes involved in glycolysis and repressing genes participating in gluconeogenesis [ 61 ] .
In the present study , we found that the transcription of csrA was not affected by a mutation in arcA , presumably CsrA remained fully functional in the mutant to provide the switch from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis by repressing the genes associated with glycolysis and activating Evans et al. .
BMC Microbiology 2011 , 11:58 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/11/58 Page 11 of 16 Figure 5 Virulence comparison of the WT and the arcA mutant in 6 - 8 week old C57BL/6 mice .
( A ) Single infection assays , where two groups of five mice per strain ( WT and arcA mutant ) were challenged intraperitoneally using 250 CFU/mouse , as described in Materials and Methods .
Percent survival is the number of mice surviving relative to the number of mice challenged at zero time ; ( B ) Competitive infection assays , where groups of three 6 - week - old mice were infected orally ( p. o. ) or i. p. with a 1:1 mixture of S. Typhimurium 14028 s and its isogenic arcA mutant .
After 4 or 6 days following i.p. or p.o. infection , respectively , mice were euthanized and mesenteric lymph nodes ( MLN ) , liver , and spleen were collected for enumeration of the WT and the mutant .
The competitive index ( CI ) was calculated as described in the Materials and Methods .
those genes affiliated with gluconeogenesis .
A mutation in arcA caused a 2.65 - fold increase in the expression of ptsG , a glucose - specific IIB component of the PTS - system ( STM1203 ) , which is required for the first step in glucose metabolism .
A similar 2 - fold increase was noticed in E. coli and the binding of ArcA to the promoter of ptsG was demonstrated [ 54 ] .
Under anaerobic conditions and in the absence of electron - acceptors , where the reduced quinone carriers can activate ArcA , it seems to be more advantageous for S. Typhimurium and E. coli cells to control the rate of glucose metabolism in order to reduce the rate of production of acidic end - products .
Thus , the adaptation to anaerobic environments requires the regulation of the rate of glycolysis , the utilization of the fermentation products , and the use of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate shunt in order for the organism to compete with others during sudden changes in oxygen concentrations .
E. coli contains two oxidases in its respiratory chain .
The first , which is known to decrease under anaerobic - growth conditions and has a low affinity for oxygen , cytochrome o ( encoded by the cyoABCDE ) andthesecond , whichis known to increase during anaerobic - growth and has a high affinity for oxygen , cytochrome d ( encoded by the cydAB ) [ 62 ] .
Our data show that , anaerobically , ArcA repressed the cyo operon ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) , while the expression of cyd operon was slightly reduced in the arcA mutant relative to WT ( i.e. , ArcA is required for the activation of cyd ) .
These results are in agreement with previous reports showing that a mutation in either arcA or arcB diminished cyd operon expression under aerobic and anaerobic conditions , while either mutation did not fully abolish repression of the cyo operon anaerobically [ 55 ] .
Our data showed that the arcA mutant has a longer doubling time compared to the WT under anaerobiosis .
This result is supported by our microarray data whereby several genes responsible for glycogen synthesis and catabolism as well as those for gluconeogenesis were down - regulated in the arcA mutant compared to the WT , while those genes regulating the tricarboxylic acid cycle ( TCA ) , glyoxylate shunt , glycolysis , pentose phosphate shunt , and acetate metabolism were all upregulated in the arcA mutant compared to the WT .
Thus , under anaerobiosis , in arcA mutant cells , an energy imbalance is created , whereby the cells direct products through various metabolic pathways typically used during aerobiosis due to the de - repression of the TCA cycle , which subsequently yields a pool of reducing equivalents that can only be reduced in the presence of electron - acceptors .
Normally , during anaerobiosis , less energy in the form of ATP is generated .
Thus , the arcA mutant cells appear to waste a vast amount of energy to express and maintain metabolic pathways that are not required under anaerobiosis , which may contribute to the slower growth - rate of the culture .
However , further work is required to determine NAD/NADH pools in the arcA mutant compared to the WT .
BMC Microbiology 2011 , 11:58 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/11/58 Page 12 of 16 ArcA and hydrogenases Hydrogen gas ( H 2 ) is an important energy source for the survival of pathogens in - vivo [ 63 ] and is produced in the host via colonic bacterial fermentations [ 64 ] .
Our results indicated that the hyb operon was activated in the arcA mutant , but these levels were not within our ± 2.5 - fold threshold .
Additionally , STM1538 , STM1539 , STM1786 , STM1788 , STM1790 , and STM1791 , which also code for hydrogenases were significantly repressed in the arcA mutant ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) , in agreement with previous results [ 65 ] .
ArcA regulation of cobalamine synthesis and metabolism Propanediol ( encoded by the pdu operon ) , a fermentation product of rhamnose or fucose [ 66,67 ] , and ethanolamine ( encoded by the eut operon ) , an essential component of bacterial and eukaryotic cells , can be used by Salmonella as carbon and energy sources in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract [ 67 ] .
Vitamin B 12 , its synthesis being encoded by the cob operon , is required for the metabolism of ethanolamine and propanediol , while anaerobic utilization of these substrates also requires the use of tetrathionate ( ttr ) as a terminal electron - acceptor [ 68 ] .
The positive regulatory protein , PocR , is necessary for the induction of the cob and pdu operons and is subject to global regulatory control via ArcA and/or Crp [ 69,70 ] .
In vivo expression technology ( IVET ) has shown that genes coding for cobalamine synthesis and 1,2 - propanediol degradation are required for Salmonella replication in macrophages [ 71 ] , that pdu genes may be necessary for intracellular proliferation within the host [ 72 ] , and that pdu mutations , but not cob mutations can be attributed to a defect in virulence [ 73,74 ] .
Strains harboring mutations in ethanolamine utilization genes are attenuated in macrophages and in BALB/c mice when delivered orally , but not intraperitoneally [ 75 ] .
Our data ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) show that pocR , the transcriptional regulator of propanediol utilization , was significantly activated by ArcA .
Furthermore , all of the genes in the eut and pdu operons were activated by ArcA ( Figure 3 and Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
An arcA mutation in S. Typhimurium has been shown to cause reduced expression of the cob and pdu operons during anaerobic - growth [ 69 ] .
Interestingly , when comparing the data from the present study and our Fnr data [ 20 ] , we found that ArcA and Fnr share in the regulation of the eut operon ( Additional file 1 : Table S2 ) , while the pdu operon was more positively regulated by ArcA than by Fnr .
Transcription of tetrathionate ( ttr operon ) was activated at equal levels by both Fnr and ArcA .
Previous studies [ 68,70 ] have shown that induction of the ttr operon is affected by Fnr , but not by ArcA .
This may suggest that Fnr plays a more significant role in regulating the eut operon [ 70 ] , while ArcA acts more significantly on regulating the genes associated with the pdu operon .
Although , both the cob and pdu operons were both activated in the arcA mutant , this may be due to the effects of arcA on anaerobic pocR expression , which subsequently regulates the rest of each of these operons .
ArcA and flagellar biosynthesis/swarming motility / chemotaxis Our data show that , anaerobically , ArcA positively regulates the expression of genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis , swarming motility , and chemotaxis ( Figures 3 and 4 ; Table 3 and Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) including many newly identified flagellar genes ( i.e. , mcpAC and cheV ) [ 43 ] .
Previously , we found that Fnr positively regulates many of the same the flagellar and chemotaxis genes under anaerobic conditions [ 20 ] ; indeed the anaerobic motility phenotype of the arcA mutant was indistinguishable from that previously seen with the fnr mutant [ 20 ] .
Furthermore , the expression of the flagellar biosynthesis , motility , and chemotaxis genes under anaerobiosis was more highly activated by Fnr than by ArcA ( Additional file 1 : Table S2 ) .
A plethora of regulators affect the expression of flhDC and motility in E. coli and S. Typhimurium [ 20,76 - 86 ] .
Our data showed that ArcA activates class 2 and class 3 flagellar genes and we identified a potential ArcA binding site in filA , filZ , flgM , andflgN .
ArcA seems to slightly repress flhDC ( i. e. , below our cut - off level of ± 2.5 - fold ) .
In agreement with our work , ArcA was recently shown to be necessary for the expression of fliA in E. coli , but not for the master regulator , flhDC [ 56 ] .
However , using in silico analysis , the authors did not identify ArcA binding sites in the promoter regions of fliA or other class 2 flagellar genes [ 56 ] , ArcA and antioxidant defenses Under aerobic conditions , ArcA has been reported to be essential for the resistance of S. Enteritidis to RNS and ROS via an unknown mechanism [ 57 ] .
In agreement with this report [ 57 ] , we found that the arcA mutant of S. Typhimurium to be more sensitive to hydrogen - peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) under aerobic conditions ( Additional file 1 : Figure S2 ) .
Anaerobically , our data indicate that the expression of many of the antioxidant genes [ i.e. : sodA , sodB , sodC1 , andsodC2 ( coding for superoxide dismutases ) and katG and katE ( coding for hydroperoxidases ) , and hmpA ( coding for flavohemoglobin ) ] were not significantly affected by ArcA ; however the expression of STM1731 ( Mn - catalase , katN ) was significantly increased in the arcA mutant compared to the WT ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
To date , the physiological role of Mn - catalase ( KatN ) in S. Typhimurium has not been thoroughly examined , although , its ability to Evans et al. .
BMC Microbiology 2011 , 11:58 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/11/58 Page 13 of 16 scavenge H 2 O 2 and work together with KatE , KatG , and the hydroperoxide reductases to protect the cell from oxidative - stress has been demonstrated [ 87 ] .
In addition , it has been proposed that the substitution of iron by manganese as a co - factor might be a way to circumvent iron restriction by the host during infection [ 88 ] .
ArcA and pathogenesis The majority of the virulence - factors ( ~ 200 genes ) of S. Typhimurium are chromosomally located within Salmonella pathogenicity islands ( SPIs ) [ 2,89 - 93 ] .
SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 both encode TTSSs [ 4,45,94 ] .
SPI - 1 effectors ' proteins are required for epithelial cell invasion [ 95 ] , while SPI - 2 encodes secreted proteins , their specific chaperones [ 4 ] , and a two - component regulatory system [ 96,97 ] , are all required for intracellular replication .
Recently , SPI - 1 invasion genes were found to be required for intramacrophage survival [ 98 ] and systemic infection in mice [ 99 ] .
Our data have shown that most of the SPI - 1 through SPI - 5 genes were not significantly regulated by ArcA , with the exception of three genes contained within SPI - 3 including , mgtC , mgtB , andslsA ( Figure 3 and Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) .
Thus , it is not surprising that our arcA mutant was determined to be as virulent as the WT strain following individual infection studies ( Figure 5A ) , but was slightly more persistent than the WT following o. p. and i. p. competitive infection studies ( Figure 5B ) , however , the difference was not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 ) .
Flagellar regulons have been shown to influence virulence gene expression in several pathogenic microorganisms [ 100 - 106 ] .
Interestingly , data from our previous study [ 20 ] , showed that the fnr mutant was non - motile and non - virulent , while in the present study , the arcA mutant was non - motile , but remained virulent .
Clearly , the lack of motility does not necessarily correlate with the lack of virulence in S. Typhimurium .
Overlapping global regulation by ArcA and Fnr ArcA and Fnr are two well known redox regulators in E. coli , S. Typhimurium , and other bacteria .
We previously published the first report on the global role of Fnr in anaerobically grown S. Typhmurium [ 20 ] .
The present study is the first report on the global regulatory role of ArcA in the same organism under the same experimental conditions and statistical constraints .
Therefore , it is possible and reliable to compare genes / operons regulated by these two important transcriptional factors ( i. e. , ArcA and Fnr ) .
The data indicated that ArcA and Fnr shared in the regulation of 120 genes ; while the numbers of genes solely regulated by either ArcA or Fnr were 272 and 191 , respectively .
The 120 genes that were regulated by either ArcA or Fnr are listed ( Additional file 1 : Table S2 ) .
These include genes involved in cytochrome c oxidase ( cyoABCDE ) , glutamate/aspartate transport ( gltlJKL ) , dipeptide transport ( dppABCDF ) , succinyl - CoA synthetase - a & b subunits ( sucDC ) , tricarboxylic transport ( STM2786 , STM2787 , STM2788 ) , L - lactate transport and metabolism ( lldPRD ) , nitrite reductase ( nrfAB ) , 2 - dexoyribose - 5-phosphate aldolase ( deoC ) , thymidine phosphorylase ( deoA ) , aerotaxis sensor receptor ( aer ) , ethanolamine utilization ( eut operon - STM2454 - 2470 ) , and several genes involving flagellar biosynthesis , motility , and chemotaxis .
Interestingly , most of the 120 genes were regulated by ArcA and Fnr in the same fashion ( i.e. , repressed or activated ) except for yneB ( putative fructose - 1,6 - bisphosphate aldolase - STM4078 ) , which was activated by ArcA , but repressed by Fnr ( Additional file 1 : Table S2 ) .
The opposing regulation of yneB by ArcA and Fnr indeed warrant further studies .
Conclusion ( s ) Herein , we report on the role of the two - component regulator , ArcA , in the genome - wide response to oxygen in Salmonella .
Our data clearly demonstrate that ArcA serves , directly or indirectly , as a regulator/modulator of genes involved in aerobic/anaerobic energy metabolism and motility .
In a recent study [ 20 ] , we demonstrated that the oxygen sensing , global regulator , Fnr participates in coordinating anaerobic metabolism , flagellar biosynthesis , motility , chemotaxis , and virulence in S. Typhimurium .
In the present study , we identified a set of 120 genes whose regulation is shared between ArcA and Fnr .
We also demonstrated that Fnr plays a more hierarchical role than ArcA in pathogenesis .
Furthermore , under our experimental conditions , we demonstrated that the lack of motility does not necessarily correspond to the lack of virulence in S. Typhimurium .
