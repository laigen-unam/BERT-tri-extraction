AMPs are made by virtually all single and multicellular organisms and are encountered by bacteria in diverse environments , including within a host .
Bacteria use sensor - kinase systems to respond to AMPs or damage caused by AMPs .
Salmonella enterica deploys at least three different sensor - kinase systems to modify gene expression in the presence of AMPs : PhoP - PhoQ , PmrA - PmrB , and RcsB - RcsC - RcsD .
The ydeI gene is regulated by the RcsB - RcsC - RcsD pathway and encodes a 14 - kDa predicted oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding - fold ( OB - fold ) protein important for polymyxin B resistance in broth and also for virulence in mice .
We report here that ydeI is additionally regulated by the PhoP - PhoQ and PmrA - PmrB sensor - kinase systems , which confer resistance to cationic AMPs by modifying lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) .
ydeI , however , is not important for known LPS modifications .
Two independent biochemical methods found that YdeI copurifies with OmpD/NmpC , a member of the trimeric - barrel outer membrane general porin family .
Genetic analysis indicates that ompD contributes to polymyxin B resistance , and both ydeI and ompD are important for resistance to cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide , a mouse AMP produced by multiple cell types and expressed in the gut .
YdeI localizes to the periplasm , where it could interact with OmpD .
A second predicted periplasmic OB - fold protein , YgiW , and OmpF , another general porin , also contribute to polymyxin B resistance .
Collectively , the data suggest that periplasmic OB - fold proteins can interact with porins to increase bacterial resistance to AMPs .
Antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ) are a major class of antibiotics naturally encountered by microbes in diverse environments .
AMPs are produced by bacteria , archea , and eukarya and can lyse or prevent the replication of viruses , bacteria , and fungi ( 34 , 72 ) .
Bacterial and eukaryotic cationic AMPs are amphiphilic and are represented by a wide range of sequences , lengths , and secondary structures .
Linear alpha - helical peptides belong to the cathelicidin family and include LL - 37 ( 38 , 59 ) .
Bridged - sheet peptides include bacterial lantibiotics and mammalian defensins .
Lantibiotics are produced by gram - positive bacteria and limit interspecies competition ( 68 ) .
Defensins and cathelicidins are produced by epithelial cells and limit microbial growth on epithelial cell surfaces , such as in the gastrointestinal tract ( 37 , 72 ) .
Polymyxin B is a cationic AMP derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus polymyxa ( 11 ) .
It consists of a peptide ring with a hydrophobic tail ( 51 ) and is commonly used in research laboratories as a model for AMPs because it is inexpensive , commercially available , and effective against a wide variety of bacterial species .
The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant pathogens has stimulated interest in the therapeutic use of AMPs , as well as in the understanding of bacterial mechanisms needed for Cellular , and Developmental Biology , 347 UCB , University of Colorado at Boulder , Boulder , CO 80309 .

responding to and resisting AMPs .
Salmonella enterica utilize at least three different sensor - kinase systems to respond to cationic AMPs : PhoP - PhoQ ( PhoPQ ) , PmrA - PmrB ( PmrAB ) , and RcsB - RcsC - RcsD ( RcsBCD ) ( 20 , 21 , 30 ) .
All three of these signaling pathways are important for S. enterica virulence in mice ( 20 , 22 , 26 , 29 , 46 , 48 ) .
The PhoPQ system directly regulates genes that confer AMP resistance , such as pgtE , which encodes an outer membrane protease that cleaves cathelicidins ( 27 ) .
PhoPQ also activates transcription of the gene encoding PagP , which transfers palmitate to lipid - A , reducing outer membrane permeability and increasing bacterial viability in the presence of AMPs ( 31 ) .
The PmrAB sensor - kinase system is another target of PhoPQ .
PmrA activates genes needed to modify lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) with aminoarabinose or phosphoethanolamine , both of which decrease the local and overall negative charge of lipid - A and thereby minimize electrostatic interactions with cationic peptides ( 28 , 44 , 73 ) .
The RcsBCD ( named for regulator of capsule synthesis ) sensor kinase system also contributes to polymyxin B resistance ( 17 , 20 ) .
RcsB and RcsC were initially identified based on their roles in capsule production ( 60 ) , which requires the RcsA transcription factor in addition to the RcsB response regulator ( 61 ) .
RcsA , however , does not contribute to polymyxin B resistance ( 20 ) .
A whole - genome DNA microarray screen identified genes induced by polymyxin B in an RcsBCD - dependent , RcsA - independent pattern ( 20 ) .
One of the identified genes , ydeI , encodes a 14 - kDa predicted periplasmic protein of unknown function that is limited to S. enterica , Escherichia coli , and Shigella spp. .
YdeI is important for resistance to polymyxin B in broth and for bacterial survival in mice upon oral , but not 7243 7244 PILONIETA ET AL. .
intraperitoneal inoculation , suggesting a role for YdeI in the gastrointestinal tract of mice ( 20 ) .
Bioinformatics analyses identified YdeI as an oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide bindingfold ( OB - fold ) protein ( COG3111 ) ( 25 ) .
OB - fold family members have a structural fold of five antiparallel - sheets that form a closed or partially opened barrel .
The barrel of an OB - fold protein can function as a scaffold for the binding of small polymers , including nucleotides and sugars ( 62 ) .
However , bacterial OB - fold proteins lack residues appropriate for nucleotide binding ( 25 ) and are of unknown function .
To address how YdeI may function , we established whether the gene is regulated by known transcriptional activators of AMP resistance genes .
In addition to RcsBCD ( 20 ) , ydeI was regulated by PhoPQ and PmrAB , but ydeI mutant strains produced LPS similar to that of wild - type strains , indicating ydeI contributes to AMP resistance via an unknown mechanism .
YdeI copurified with an outer membrane porin , OmpD / NmpC , and genetic data supported an interaction between YdeI and OmpD , since strains lacking either or both genes were similarly sensitive to AMPs .
In cell fractionation experiments , YdeI localized to the periplasm .
S. enterica serotype Typhimurium encodes a second predicted OB - fold periplasmic protein , YgiW ( 5 , 25 ) , which is also important for polymyxin B resistance .
In addition , the porin OmpF , but not OmpE , for instance , contributed to polymyxin B resistance .
These data suggest OB - fold proteins can protect bacteria from cationic AMPs , and that YdeI confers AMP protection in conjunction with the general porin OmpD .
We suggest YdeI be renamed OmdA , for OmpD - Associated protein .
All bacteria were grown and maintained at 37 °C with agitation in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth or on LB agar plates .
The following antibiotic concentrations were used : Streptomycin ( Str ) at 200 g/ml , kanamycin ( Kan ) at 30 g/ml , and chloramphenicol ( Cm ) at 10 g/ml .
Strains described in the present study ( Table 1 ) were derived from wild - type S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 ( 58 ) .
The oligonucleotides used for generating deletion mutants are detailed in Table 2 ( 15 ) .
Mutations were made in the S. Typhimurium 14028 strain background ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) , verified by PCR , and transduced into SL1344 using standard P22 phage transduction ( 63 ) .
Transductants were verified by growth - on - LB agar containing the appropriate antibiotic and by PCR .
Epitope - tagged strains KDE612 ( ydeI : : HA Kan r ) and NMM748 ( ompD : : 3xFLAG Kan r ) were generated in SL1344 ( 65 ) by using oligonucleotides shown in Table 2 .
To generate double - tagged strains , the Kan resistance cassette was removed from KDE612 ( ydeI : : HA ) by transformation with the plasmid pCP20 ( 15 ) .
The resulting strain , KDE642 ( yde : : HA Kan ) , was the recipient for transduction with a phage lysate from NMM748 ( ompD : : 3xFLAG Kan r ) , to generate strain KDE759 ( ydeI : : HA Kan ompD : : 3xFLAG Kan r ) .
The Kan resistance cassette was removed from KDE759 to yield KDE769 ( ydeI : : HA Kan ompD : : 3xFLAG Kan ) .

Briefly , 20 - ml cultures at an OD 600 of 0.5 to 0.6 were induced with 0.3 mM IPTG ( isopropyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ) for 3 h. Cultures were centrifuged , and pellets were resuspended in B - PER lysis reagent ( Pierce Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , which contains the detergent n - octyl - - D - thioglucopyranoside ( 70 ) , supplemented with lysozyme ( 100 g/ml ) and DNase I ( 100 U/ml ) .
After 15 min of incubation at room temperature , lysates were centrifuged at 4,000 g for 10 min , and the supernatant was harvested and loaded onto columns containing 20 l of anti - HA agarose beads .
YdeI - HA and GST - HA were eluted with either an HA dipeptide or at pH 2.8 .
The same procedure was carried out with the wild - type SL1344 strain .
Samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE , which was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting or stained either with silver or SYPRO - Ruby for mass spectrometric analysis , which was performed by the Vincent Coates Foundation Mass Spectrometry Laboratory , Stanford University Mass Spectrometry ( http://mass - spec.stanford.edu ) .

Methyl viologen sensitivity disk assay .
Wild - type ( SL1344 ) , ompD ( KDE 735 ) , yddG ( KDE 737 ) , and ydeI ( KDE602 ) strains and 14028s , a wild - type strain used in previous methyl viologen assays ( 55 ) , were grown overnight in LB - medium with antibiotics at 37 °C .
Cultures were diluted 1:10 in PBS to an OD 600 of 10 7 bacteria/ml and spread to LB - or M9 - agar plates with or without antibiotics .
A 0.5 M stock of methyl viologen was diluted in water to concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 mM .
Methyl viologen was spotted onto sterile filter paper disks and placed in the center of the plates containing spread bacteria .
Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C , and the diameter of the growth inhibition zones was determined as the average of the largest and the smallest diameters , which differed by 1 mm .
Over the course of six experiments , differences in halo size between strains were not observed at any concentration of methyl viologen .
P values were determined with two - tailed Student t tests .
Error bars represent standard deviations .
RESULTS ydeI expression is regulated by multiple sensor - kinase signaling systems .
The PhoPQ and the PmrAB two - component regulatory systems confer bacterial resistance to polymyxin B by modifying the lipid - A component of LPS ( 30 ) .
pmrA mutant strains are , like ydeI mutants strains , defective for virulence upon oral but not intraperitoneal inoculation , suggesting that both genes play roles in the gastrointestinal tract phase of infection ( 20 , 29 ) .
However , pmrA is important for survival in 10 M iron ( 69 ) , whereas ydeI is not ( data not shown ) .
To establish whether ydeI induction in the presence of polymyxin B requires the PhoP or PmrA response regulators , ydeI mRNA accumulation was evaluated by real - time quantitative PCR in early exponential stage polymyxin B - treated wild - type and mutant strains ( Fig. 1A ) .
ydeI expression increased approximately threefold in wild - type Salmonella treated with polymyxin B , but not in strains lacking rcsB .
This confirmed that rcsB is required for the induction of ydeI ( 20 ) .
ydeI mRNA levels were similarly low in strains lacking phoP , either in the presence or absence of polymyxin B .
In rcsB phoP double mutant strains , ydeI transcript levels were similar to the background levels observed in strains lacking the ydeI gene .
In the presence of polymyxin B , VOL .

ydeI mRNA accumulation requires PhoP and PmrA .
Realtime quantitative PCR was used to evaluate ydeI mRNA levels and samples were normalized to a gapA control .
( A ) ydeI mRNA levels after exposure to polymyxin B for 40 min in LB - medium using strains with the indicated genes deleted .
( B ) ydeI mRNA levels in early stationary phase cells in LB - medium .
The data are representative of three independent experiments .
pmrA mutant strains had higher levels of ydeI mRNA than rcsB and phoP mutant strains but significantly lower levels than the wild type ( Fig. 1A ) .
These data show that ydeI induction via polymyxin B treatment is modulated by the response regulators of three sensor - kinase systems , RcsB , PhoP , and PmrA .
The RcsBCD system is activated in early stationary - phase ( 35 , 52 ) , which may mimic the growth state of S. enterica in the gastrointestinal tract ( 40 ) .
To determine whether cells at early stationary - phase require PhoP and PmrA for ydeI regulation , mRNA was examined .
ydeI mRNA levels were approximately four times higher in wild - type strains at early stationary - phase than in log phase after treatment with polymyxin B ( Fig. 1B ) , a finding consistent with ydeI regulation by RpoS , the stationary phase sigma factor ( 20 ) .
ydeI accumulation was also clearly dependent on rcsB , phoP , and pmrA .
Thus , the PhoPQ , PmrAB , and RcsBCD sensor - kinase systems play a role in inducing ydeI in early stationary - phase , as well as in response to polymyxin B. ydeI does not modify LPS based on SDS - PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis .
Molecular modifications of LPS lipid - A , core , or O - antigen confer resistance to cationic peptides , including polymyxin B ( 2 , 30 ) .
Genes that modulate O - antigen chain length in S. enterica are activated by the PmrAB and RcsBCD systems ( 16 ) , and PhoPQ may play an indirect role in modulating O - antigen chain length ( 29 , 41 ) .
LPS and lipid - A from ydeI mutant strains and the wild type are indistinguishable .
( A ) LPS was isolated from wild - type ( WT ) and strains with deletions of the genes indicated , separated by SDS - PAGE , and silver stained .
( B ) MALDI - TOF mass spectra of lipid - A from wild - type and phoP and ydeI mutant strains .
The mass/charge ( m/z ) ratios and related structures are as follows : 1,796 unmodified hexa - acyl lipid - A ; 1,813 , hexa - acyl lipid - A with 2 - OH myristate ; 1,937 , hexa - acyl lipid - A with Ara4N ; 2,036 , unmodified hepta - acyl - lipid - A ; and 2,167 , hepta - acyl - lipid - A with Ara4N .
whether chain length is altered in ydeI mutants by SDS - PAGE analysis of LPS isolated from wild - type and ydeI mutant strains ( Fig. 2A ) .
A galE mutant control , a rough strain lacking O - antigen , had the lipid - A and core region of LPS but lacked bands of higher molecular weight .
phoP mutant - derived LPS had a banding pattern similar to that of the wild type , consis - 7248 PILONIETA ET AL. .
tent with previous observations ( 6 , 23 ) .
In addition , ydeI mutants had LPS ladder profiles similar to that of the wild type .
These results suggest the polymyxin B sensitivity of ydeI mutant strains is not due to a change in O - antigen length or status .
PhoPQ and the PmrAB sensor - kinase systems contribute to cationic AMP resistance by modifying the lipid - A portion of LPS ( 28 , 32 , 73 ) .
Since PhoPQ and PmrAB regulate ydeI , the question of whether ydeI mutants can modify lipid - A was examined .
LPS was isolated from Salmonella wild - type and mutant strains , and the lipid - A portion was analyzed by mass spectrometry .
A phoP mutant strain was included as a negative control , since phoP is needed to modify lipid - A by palmitoylation , phosphoethanolamine incorporation , or 4 - amino - 4-deoxy - L-arabinose addition ( 21 ) .
Negative - ion MALDI - TOF mass spectrometry revealed that the lipid - A isolated from ydeI mutants contained modifications similar to those of the wild type ( Fig. 2B ) .
These results , along with the O - antigen chain length analysis , indicate that YdeI contributes to antimicrobial peptide resistance using a mechanism that does not involve LPS modifications .
OmpD specifically copurifies with YdeI .
Since it does not appear that YdeI modifies LPS , a different approach was taken to understand how YdeI may contribute to AMP resistance .
Immunoaffinity chromatography was performed to identify proteins that may interact with YdeI .
YdeI was epitope tagged with HA and expressed from the pTac promoter ( pYdeI - HA ) on a plasmid in a wild - type strain .
YdeI - HA was purified by using immunoaffinity chromatography and eluted with either an HA dipeptide or at low pH. Regardless of elution method , a discrete 40 - kDa band of protein copurified with YdeI - HA ( Fig. 3A ) .
Control experiments with a wild - type strain yielded no bands , indicating that the 40 - kDa band does not interact with the column .
A 28 - kDa protein copurified with YdeI - HA inconsistently between experiments and was not pursued further .
The 40 - kDa protein band was isolated and subjected to proteolytic digestion and tandem mass spectrometric analysis , which identified five peptides of 11 to 13 amino - acids in length , each specific to OmpD , a major outer membrane porin .
To determine whether the interaction between OmpD , an abundant protein ( 4 ) , and YdeI was specific , the experiment was repeated with two additional strains harboring chromosomal OmpD - 3xFLAG , one with pGST - HA and one with pYdeI - HA .
Silver staining shows coelution of a 40 - kDa protein band with YdeI - HA whether or not OmpD was epitope tagged , but not with GST - HA .
GST - HA comigrates with the 28 - kDa nonspecific band , as expected ( Fig. 3B ) .
Immunoblotting of GST - HA flowthrough and eluate revealed OmpD - 3xFLAG in the former but not in the latter , showing that OmpD - 3xFLAG was produced but did not bind GST - HA ( Fig. 3C ) .
Thus , OmpD specifically interacts with YdeI .
OmpD coimmunoprecipitates with YdeI .
To establish whether YdeI interacts with OmpD under conditions in which both proteins are regulated by their native promoters , coimmunoprecipitations were performed with chromosomally expressed YdeI ( chrYdeI - HA ) and OmpD ( OmpD - 3xFLAG ) .
In these strains , an epitope tag sequence was inserted in - frame at the C terminus of the ydeI or ompD genes .
When YdeI - HA was immunoprecipitated with anti - HA antibody , OmpD - 3xFLAG coimmunoprecipitated , indicating that YdeI and OmpD interact ( Fig. 4 ) .
However , when OmpD - 3xFLAG was immunopre - FIG. 3 .
OmpD specifically copurifies with YdeI .

OmpD - 3xFLAG coimmunoprecipitates with chromosomally expressed YdeI - HA .
Strains encoding chromosomally expressed , epitope - tagged YdeI - HA and OmpD - 3xFLAG were grown overnight in LB - medium , harvested , and lysed , and YdeI - HA was immunoprecipitated with mouse anti - HA antibody coupled to protein G - agarose beads .
Supernatant ( SN ) or agarose bead immunoprecipitate ( IP ) from equivalent numbers of bacteria was resolved by SDS - PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with ( A ) an anti - FLAG antibody or ( B ) an anti - HA antibody .
Molecular weight markers are indicated by bars to the left ; the heavy and light chains of the immunoprecipitating antibody are indicated by arrows to the right of ( B ) .
cipitated with anti - FLAG antibody , YdeI - HA did not coimmunoprecipitate ( data not shown ) , suggesting the anti - FLAG antibody disrupts the YdeI - OmpD interaction or that only a fraction of OmpD interacts with YdeI .
Nevertheless , the data as a whole confirm the observation that YdeI interacts with the OmpD porin under native conditions .
OmpD is important for resistance to polymyxin B. Genetic analyses were performed based on the hypothesis that if YdeI and OmpD interact to confer antimicrobial peptide resistance , then strains lacking ompD would be sensitive to antimicrobial peptides .
ydeI and ompD single mutant strains were both mildly sensitive to polymyxin B compared to the extremely sensitive phoP mutant control strain ( Fig. 5A ) .
This observation is consistent with the idea ydeI and ompD represent just one of the multiple mechanisms of AMP resistance activated by PhoP ( 21 ) .
In addition , ydeI ompD double mutant strains were only as sensitive to polymyxin B as the single mutant strains .
If YdeI and OmpD functioned in independent pathways to confer AMP resistance , the double mutant strains would be expected to be more sensitive to AMP than either single mutant strain , particularly since the strains analyzed contain complete deletions of the corresponding genes .
These data suggest YdeI and OmpD function in the same pathway to confer polymyxin B resistance .
YdeI and OmpD confer resistance to a mouse cathelicidin .
S. Typhimurium strains lacking ydeI are attenuated in mice when delivered orally , the natural route of infection , but not FIG. 5 .
ompD mutant strains are sensitive to polymyxin B and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide .
Strains harboring deletions of ydeI , ompD , or both genes were incubated in the presence of 4 g of polymyxin B/ml ( A ) or 50 M cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide ( B ) and plated for CFU .
Controls included wild - type ( WT ) and a phoP insertion mutant .
The data are reported as percent survival relative to the wild type .
Asterisks represent P values on triplicate samples , as determined by a Student t test ( P 0.001 ) .
when delivered into the peritoneal cavity ( 20 ) .
This pattern of attenuation suggests that YdeI may be important for resistance to gastrointestinal tract antimicrobial peptides , an idea consistent with the observation that the bacteria adhere to the mouse small intestine ( 7 ) .
Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide is a murine cationic AMP produced by multiple cell types , including macrophages and epithelial cells ( 9 , 14 , 54 ) , and is expressed in the small intestine ( 24 ) .
Single mutant ydeI and ompD strains were mildly sensitive to cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide exposure ( Fig. 5B ) , showing that both genes are important for resistance to a physiologically relevant AMP .
Double - mutant ydeI and ompD strains were only as sensitive to cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide as single mutant strains , suggesting that YdeI and OmpD function together to increase bacterial resistance to gastrointestinal tract AMPs .
YdeI is a periplasmic protein .
To establish whether YdeI localizes to the periplasm and therefore could plausibly interact with OmpD , cell fractionation and immunoblotting of strains with chromosomal YdeI - HA were performed .
YdeI - HA localized to both the cytoplasmic and the periplasmic samples , as determined by DnaK and maltose binding protein control proteins , respectively ( Fig. 6 ) .
YdeI - HA in the cytoplasm may reflect ongoing protein translation or that YdeI has an un - 7250 PILONIETA ET AL. .
YdeI is in the periplasm .
Immunoblotting of whole - cell ( WC ) lysates and fractions from an YdeI - HA strain ( KDE686 ) .
The upper blot was probed with an anti - HA antibody , and the lower with anti - DnaK and anti - maltose binding protein ( MBP ) antibodies to identify cytoplasmic ( C ) and periplasmic ( PP ) fractions .
known role in the cytoplasm .
Nevertheless , the clear presence of YdeI - HA in the periplasm is consistent with a model in which YdeI interacts with the outer membrane protein OmpD in the periplasmic compartment .
The porin ompF and the OB - fold protein ygiW contribute to polymyxin B resistance .
To establish whether other porins or OB - fold proteins may contribute to AMP resistance , strains with deletions of the following genes were constructed : ompC , ompF , ompE , ompN , and STM1530 ( porins ) , and ygiW ( OBfold protein ) .
ompF and ygiW mutants were moderately sensitive to polymyxin B ( Fig. 7 ) .
The remaining porins and also an invA mutant strain , lacking an inner membrane protein , were not sensitive to polymyxin B ( P 0.01 , data not shown ) .
The results suggest that S. Typhimurium periplasmic OB - fold proteins , YdeI and YgiW , and the porins OmpD and OmpF may help protect the bacteria from AMPs .
DISCUSSION To establish how YdeI contributes to AMP resistance , we first determined whether ydeI activation requires the PhoPQ or PmrAB sensor - kinase systems , which together regulate a large number of genes important for AMP resistance ( 30 ) .
ydeI induction required phoP and pmrA upon exposure to polymyxin B and in early stationary - phase ( Fig. 1 ) .
Whether transcription of ydeI is directly or indirectly regulated by PhoP , PmrA , and RcsB is unknown , but a putative PhoP - binding site exists 65 nucleotides upstream of the ydeI promoter ( 47 ; data not shown ) .
PhoP and PmrA confer AMP resistance by activating genes needed to modify LPS ( 30 ) , but ydeI does not appear to play a major role in altering O - antigen length or the charge or fatty acid composition of LPS ( Fig. 2 ) .
To identify proteins that might interact with YdeI , mass spectrometry was performed on a 40 - kDa band of protein that coeluted with YdeI ( Fig. 3 ) .
The major protein identified was OmpD , an outer membrane protein , and immunoprecipitation indicated that chromosomal YdeI and OmpD interact ( Fig. 4 ) .
OmpF is a 40.0 - kDa protein that should migrate very similarly to OmpD ( 39.7 - kDa ) .
A band of 40 - kDa was sent for mass spectrometry and no peptides matching OmpF were found .
Strains with a deletion in ompD , ydeI , or both genes are moderately sensitive to polymyxin B and to cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide ( Fig. 5 ) , an AMP expressed in the mouse intestine ( 24 ) .
ygiW and ompF mutants are sensitive to polymyxin B. Strains with the indicated gene deleted were incubated with 8 g of polymyxin B/ml and plated for CFU .
The data are reported as percent survival relative to the wild type ( WT ) .
Single and double asterisks represent P values on triplicate samples , as determined by a Student t test ( P 0.01 and P 0.001 , respectively ) .
YdeI localizes to the periplasm ( Fig. 6 ) .
Collectively , the data suggest that periplasmic YdeI may interact with OmpD in the outer membrane to facilitate AMP resistance .
We propose that YdeI be renamed OmdA , for OmpD - Associated protein .
OmpD is a general porin , defined as a protein that forms a trimeric outer membrane channel capable of transporting solutes based on size and charge ( 50 ) .
The channel of OmpD has a minimum pore size of 0.8 nm and preferentially transports cations ( 8 ) .
OmpD has been proposed to function in conjunction with a predicted inner membrane efflux pump , YddG , in resistance to methyl viologen ( paraquat ) and aromatic amino acids ( 19 , 55 , 56 ) .
We did not find that a deletion of yddG significantly altered polymyxin B sensitivity ( data not shown ) , and strains lacking ompD , ydeI/omdA , oryddG were not more sensitive to methyl viologen than the wild - type parent strain ( see Materials and Methods ) .
In addition , several other general porins and also an inner membrane protein , InvA , did not contribute significantly to polymyxin B resistance .
However , the porin OmpF and the OB - fold periplasmic protein YgiW did show evidence of conferring AMP resistance ( Fig. 7 ) .
In Vibrio cholerae , the porin , OmpU , has been implicated in bacterial resistance to multiple stressors , including polymyxin B , organic - acids , and bactericidal/permeability - increasing protein ( a 55 - to 60 - kDa protein on the surface of human gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells ) ( 12 , 43 , 45 , 66 ) .
In Vibrio fischeri , OmpU is important for resistance to anionic detergents such as bile - salts and SDS ( 1 , 53 ) .
OmpU may respond to multiple kinds of stress via the periplasmic protease DegS , which activates SigmaE , the stress - response RNA polymerase subunit ( 42 ) .
Whether the single OB - fold protein identified by bioinformatics in Vibrio species ( 25 ) plays a role in this pathway is unknown .
In S. Typhimurium , YdeI/OmdA does not appear to be important for generalized stress responses , as ydeI/omdA mutants do not have increased sensitivity to the detergent deoxycholate ( data not shown ) .
These observations suggest the existence of multiple mechanisms by which porins contribute to resistance to small toxic molecules .
The S. Typhimurium porin OmpD and the OB - fold protein YdeI/OmdA may function together to protect bacteria from cationic AMPs .
Both ydeI/omdA and ompD are important for virulence in mice , since ydeI/omdA mutants survive poorly in VOL .
191 , 2009 YdeI/OmdA INTERACTS WITH OmpD/NmpC 7251 mice upon oral , but not intraperitoneal , infection ( 18 ) , and ompD insertion mutants have an oral 50 % lethal dose that is 13 - fold higher than that of wild - type strains ( 20 ) .
ydeI/omdA single mutants are slightly more sensitive to AMPs than either ompD single or ydeI/omdA ompD double mutants , indicating that YdeI/OmdA contributes to AMP resistance only when OmpD is present .
One possibility is that cationic AMPs can enter the cell through OmpD , but YdeI either blocks AMP entry or increases export via OmpD .
Since it is difficult to imagine how YdeI could block AMP import without blocking nutrient uptake through OmpD , it seems more likely that YdeI/OmdA passively increases cationic AMP export .
For instance , YdeI/OmdA may capture cationic AMPs in the periplasm near the OmpD pore , creating an AMP concentration gradient and thereby increasing diffusion of AMPs out of OmpD .
These observations collectively suggest a new mechanism by which gram - negative bacteria resist AMPs , involving interaction between a general porin and an OB - fold protein .
