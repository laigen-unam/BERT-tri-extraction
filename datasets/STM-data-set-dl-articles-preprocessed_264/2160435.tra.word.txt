58 , No. 6 Expression of Salmonella typhimurium Genes Required for Invasion Is Regulated by Changes in DNA Supercoiling JORGE E. GALANt * AND ROY CURTISS III Department of Biology , Washington University , St. Louis , Missouri 63130 The ability to enter intestinal epithelial cells is an essential virulence factor of salmonellae .
We have previously cloned a group of genes ( invA , B , C , and D ) that allow S. typhimurium to penetrate tissue culture cells ( J. E. Galan and R. Curtiss III , Proc .
Transcriptional and translational cat and phoA fusions to invA ( the proximal gene in the invABC operon ) were constructed , and their expression was studied by measuring the levels of alkaline phosphatase or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in mutants grown under different conditions .
It was found that when strains containing the fusions were grown on media with high - osmolarity , a condition known to increase DNA superhelicity , the level of invA transcription was approximately eightfold higher than that in strains grown on media with low osmolarity .
The osmoinducibiity of invA was independent of ompR , which controls the osmoinducibility of other genes .
Strains grown in high - osmolarity media in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of gyrase inhibitors ( novobiocin or coumermycin Al ) , which reduce the level of DNA supercoiling , showed reduced expression of invA .
Nevertheless , invA was poorly expressed in topA mutants of S. typhimurium , which have increased DNA superhelicity .
In all cases , the differential expression of the invasion genes was correlated with the ability of S. typhimurium to penetrate tissue culture cells .
These results taken together indicate that expression of S. typhimurium invasion genes is affected by changes in DNA supercoiling and suggest that this may represent a way in which this organism regulates the expression of these genes .
Invasion of the intestinal epithelial cells constitutes a crucial step - in the pathogenesis of infections by many enteric bacteria ( 21 ) .
The use of cultured epithelial cells as an in vitro model to study bacterial invasion has begun to yield important information on the biochemical and genetic bases of cell penetration by a variety of bacteria ( 9 , 15 , 26 , 27 , 39 , 44 , 45 , 57 ) , but the molecular details of the bacterium - host cell interaction remain largely unknown .
There are three species of Salmonella ( S. typhi , S. choleraesuis , and S. enteritidis ) and hundreds of serovars that cause a variety of diseases in a large number of different hosts ( 25 ) .
The type of diseases caused by these organisms depends not only on the serovar or species of the infecting bacteria but also on the species of the infected host .
The clinical and histopathological features of the disease may therefore vary greatly , from a localized gastroenteritis to a more invasive form like typhoid fever ( 25 ) .
In some cases salmonellae may cause little damage to the epithelial mucosa and simply gain access to deeper tissues , particularly those of the reticuloendothelial system , to establish a systemic infection .
In other instances , they may establish a more localized infection of the intestine , with visible damage to the mucosa .
One feature common to all salmonellae is that they penetrate the intestinal epithelial mucosa after oral ingestion ( 59 ) .
Because of the central importance of this process , a number of laboratories have begun to analyze the biochemical and genetic bases of Salmonella invasion of epithelial cells .
Many laboratories have isolated Salmonella mutants that are defective in their ability to penetrate cultured epithelial cells ( 11 , 36 , 46 ) .
Elsinghorst et al. ( 7 ) have recently reported * t Present address : Department of Microbiology , School of Medicine , State University of New York at Stony Brook , Stony Brook , NY 11794 .
1879 the identification of a 33 - kilobase region of S. typhi chromosomal DNA that conferred upon Escherichia coli HB101 the ability to penetrate tissue culture cells .
We have recently cloned a group of genes ( invA , B , C , and D ) that allow Salmonella typhimurium to penetrate tissue culture cells ( 14 ) .
Infection studies with highly virulent Salmonella strains carrying defined mutations in these genes have established that the inv genes are involved in the establishment of infection of Peyer 's patches and the small intestinal wall when the organisms are administered orally .
Hybridization studies have determined that these genes are present in all Salmonella strains tested ( including strains of S. typhi and S. choleraesuis and more than 40 serovars of S. enteritidis ) , although they are absent from other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae ( unpublished data ) .
Pathogenic bacteria make use of a great diversity of genetic information to interact with the host .
Expression of these genes are often not needed simultaneously , and therefore in many cases their expression is coordinately regulated ( 18 , 38 , 42 ) .
Recently , Finlay et al. ( 10 ) reported that exposure to epithelial cells induces de novo synthesis of Salmonella proteins that are required for invasion of tissue culture cells , and they suggested that this constitutes a mechanism of coordinate regulation of expression of invasion genes .
We report here a different mechanism for regulation of expression of genes necessary for invasion of epithelial cells .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth - conditions .
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Bacteria were grown in L broth ( 34 ) or in low - and high - osmolarity K medium as indicated .
The composition of low - osmolarity K medium has been described ( 29 ) , and when indicated , 0.3 M NaCl or 0.6 M sucrose was added to increase its osmolarity .
The following antibiotics were used at the indicated concentrations 1880 GALAN AND CURTISS INFECT .
DNA and genetic manipulations .
Chromosomal DNA isolation ( 14 ) and DNA hybridization ( 58 ) were performed as previously described .
Bacteriophage P22 HTint - mediated transduction was performed as described elsewhere ( 3 , 54 ) .
Conjugations were carried out by filter mating ( 61 ) .
Alkaline phosphatase and CAT assays .
Bacterial strains were grown under different conditions to an optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ) of 0.5 .
Cells were washed twice with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , suspended in 100 mM NaCI - 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) to 1/10 of the original volume , and disrupted by sonication .
Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 2 min .
Alkaline phosphatase ( PhoA ) was assayed as described previously ( 20 ) , and units were calculated by the following formula : units = -LCB- A405 / [ time ( minutes ) x protein concentration ( milligrams ) ] -RCB- x 1,000 .
Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) was measured at room temperature by the colorimetric method of Shaw ( 56 ) , and activity is expressed as nanograms of acetylated chloramphenicol per milligram of protein per minute .
Tissue culture cell invasion assay .
Invasion of MDCK cells by S. typhimurium was performed in 24 - well tissue culture plates as described previously ( 14 ) , with some modifications .
Infection was for 1 h in PBS with a multiplicity of infection of 10 .
After infection , monolayers were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h with Eagle minimal essential medium containing gentamicin ( 100 pug/ml ) to eliminate extracellular bacteria .
Monolayers were then lysed with PBS containing 0.1 % sodium deoxycholate to assess the total number of internalized bacteria .
Isolation of random TnphoA insertions into the S. typhimurium chromosome .
Plasmid pYA2207 is a temperature - sensitive plasmid derived from pSC304 ( 33 ) that carries a nonproductive insertion of TnS ISSOL : : phoA ( TnphoA ) ( 37 ) ( J. Galan , unpublished data ) .
Secondary transpositions of TnphoA from pYA2207 into the chromosome of S. typhimurium X3689 ( 13 ) that yielded productive fusions to alkaline phosphatase were isolated as follows .
Cells were grown in L ( broth at 30 °C to an OD6 .
of 0.4 , washed with 0.85 % NaCl , and plated on a modified MOPS ( morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ) medium ( 48 ) in which EPPS [ N - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) piperazine - N ' - ( 3 - propanesulfonic acid ) ] was substituted for MOPS and 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl phosphate ( BCIP ) was substituted for K2HPO4 as the only source of phosphate .
Plates were incubated at 30 °C , and blue colonies were visible after 3 days .
Blue colonies were then streaked for isolation on L plates containing BCIP , the plates were incubated at 37 °C , and the process was repeated until only blue colonies ( alkaline phosphate positive ) were observed .
Two random insertions in X3689 termed Y : : TnphoA and Z : : TnphoA were transduced with P22 Htint into X3687 and PM233 for use as controls in all the experiments .
Construction of invA transcriptional and translational fusions .
The construction of S. typhimurium invA : : TnphoA strain X3642 has been described elsewhere ( 14 ) .
A phoP12 mutation ( 30 ) from S. typhimurium AD154 ( obtained from E. Eisenstadt , Harvard School of Public Health , Cambridge , Mass. ) was introduced into this strain by moving a closely VOL .

This procedure eliminated acid phosphatase activity that interferes with the alkaline phosphatase assay ( 13 ) .
Conversion of invA : : TnphoA into a cat transcriptional - fusion was carried out as described elsewhere ( 31 ) .
Briefly , E. coli SM10 A pir carrying the plasmid pSKCAT was mated with the invA : : TnphoA S. typhimurium strain X3642 .
Transconjugants were selected on minimal - medium ( 48 ) containing ampicillin and kanamycin and scored for loss of alkaline phosphatase activity , an indication of the correct integration of pSKCAT .
PhoA - transconjugants had pSKCAT integrated into the chromosome at the invA locus as indicated by Southern hybridization analysis ( data not shown ) .
One of these transconjugants was strain X4115 .
REGULATION OF SALMONELLA inv GENES 1881 RESULTS Effect of osmolarity on the expression of invA .
S. typhimurium X4108 ( carrying an invA : : TnphoA fusion ) and X4115 ( carrying an invA : : cat fusion ) were grown in low - osmolarity K medium or in K medium containing either 0.3 M NaCl or 0.6 M sucrose .
The steady - state expression of invA as measured by the levels of alkaline phosphatase or CAT activity was approximately eightfold higher when strains were grown in high - osmolarity medium ( Table 2 ) .
No difference was observed in the expression of invA when either 0.3 M NaCl or 0.6 M sucrose was used as the osmolyte .
In contrast , two randomly selected productive TnphoA insertions in the same genetic background ( strains X4109 and X4110 ) showed no difference in the levels of PhoA activity when grown in either high - or low - osmolarity medium ( Table 2 ) .
An isogenic strain of S. typhimurium carrying a TnphoA productive insertion in the osmoinducible gene proU ( 2 , 40 ) ( strain X4111 ) showed a more than 20 - fold higher level of alkaline phosphatase when organisms were grown in highosmolarity medium ( Table 2 ) .
Effect of ompR on expression of invA .
The ompB loci of E. coli and S. typhimurium are each composed of two genes , ompR and envZ , which osmoregulate the expression of the outer membrane porin genes ompF and ompC ( 22 ) .
In order to determine whether invA osmoregulation was also dependent on ompB , we analyzed the effect of ompR on the expression of invA by constructing an invA : : TnphoA ompR isogenic mutant .
The ompR1009 : : TnJO mutation was moved from S. typhimurium CFH1351 ( 16 ) into strain X4108 by P22 HTint transduction , yielding strain X4112 .
This strain was tested for retention of the TnphoA insertion and ompR phenotype .
The latter was tested by determining the altered expression of ompC and ompF by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of outer membrane preparations of mutants after growth in low - and high - osmolarity media .
The presence of ompR did not affect the expression of invA : : TnphoA under either osmotic condition ( PhoA units in K medium , 37 ; PhoA units in K medium plus 0.3 M NaCl , 310 [ representative values from one of three experiments with similar results ] ) ; therefore , the osmoinducibility of invA is most likely independent of the ompB - mediated regulation .
Effect of gyrase inhibitors on invA expression .
proU is an osmoinducible locus of E. coli and S. typhimurium that encodes a glycine betaine transport system that is important in the protection of these organisms from osmotic - stress ( 2 , 40 ) .
It has been established that the osmoinducibility ofproU is determined by changes in the degree of DNA supercoiling ( 23 ) .
An increase in DNA superhelicity as a consequence of high osmotic conditions causes the induction of pro U .
The negative superhelicity of chromosomal DNA in procaryotes is in a dynamic state and changes in response to several extracellular stimuli ( 1 , 4 , 17 , 32 , 50 , 62 ) .
The degree of supercoiling is determined for the most part by the coordinate action of two enzymes , gyrase and topoisomerase I ( 6 , 52 ) .
Gyrase introduces negative supercoils in an energydependent manner , while topoisomerase I relaxes the DNA in an energy - independent way .
We used inhibitors of DNA gyrase to determine if , like induction of proU , induction of invA expression requires an increase in DNA supercoiling .
Inhibitors of DNA gyrase relax DNA ( 6 ) and therefore might be expected to inhibit expression of invA .
S. typhimurium strains carrying invA : : TnphoA ( strain X4108 ) and invA : : cat ( strain X4115 ) fusions were grown in high - osmolarity K medium containing increasing amounts of an inhibitor of the B subunit of DNA gyrase , coumermicin A1 or novobiocin .
The drug concentrations used in these experiments did not significantly inhibit cell growth .
Coumermicin A1 and novobiocin reduced the steady - state levels of expression of invA as measured by the levels of PhoA and CAT ( Table 3 ) .
The inhibitory effect of novobiocin was dose dependent , although the effect of coumermicin A1 was not dose dependent at the drug levels tested .
As previously reported ( 22 ) , expression of proU was also reduced by the gyrase inhibitors .
In contrast to these two genes , two randomly selected isogenic TnphoA insertions were either not affected ( Z : : TnphoA ) or stimulated ( Y : : TnphoA ) by the inhibitors ( Table 3 ) .

Effect of topA on the expression of invA .
To further explore the effects of DNA supercoiling on the expression of inv genes , we examined the effect of a topA mutation on invA expression .
The lack of topoisomerase I activity in topA mutants brings about an increase in the overall level of negative superhelicity of the DNA ( 6 , 52 , 53 ) .
We chose to examine the effect of the well - characterized topA mutation AtopA24 ( formerly supX24 ) ( 35 , 47 ) .
We introduced the invA : : TnphoA fusion into the chromosome of the S. typhimurium AtopA24 strain PM233 and into its wild - type parent strain PM596 ( 35 , 47 ) by P22 HTint transduction , yielding strains X4113 and X4114 , respectively .
The correct position of invA : : TnphoA in the transductants was determined by Southern hybridization ( data not shown ) , and the topA phenotype was confirmed by examining phage P22 plaque morphology ( 49 ) and the leu phenotype ( 51 ) .
invA was poorly expressed in the topA S. typhimurium strain X4113 ( Table 4 ) .
In contrast , expression of a random TnphoA fusion , Z : : TnphoA , in the same genetic background ( i.e. , x4282 ) was unaltered .
These results were unexpected since topA mutants exhibit a higher level of DNA supercoiling than their wild - type parents ( 51 ) and therefore invA should be expressed under low osmotic conditions .
Nevertheless , these results were similar to those reported by Higgins et al. ( 23 ) for the expression of proU in a AtopA background .
It is possible , as suggested by Higgins et al. , that AtopA mutants oversupercoil DNA to a degree beyond the optimal window of supercoiling at which invA transcription can efficiently proceed .

Strains grown in lowosmolarity medium were significantly impaired in their ability to penetrate tissue culture cells ( Table 5 ) .
However , the presence of AtopA significantly impaired the ability of PM233 to invade MDCK cells , a result in accord with its inability to express invA .
To determine if the induction of invA after the shift from low - to high - osmolarity medium correlated with an increase in the invasiveness of S. typhimurium , the following experiment was conducted .
S. typhimurium X4108 ( carrying an invA : : TnphoA fusion in its chromosome ) was grown in low - osmolarity K medium to an OD6o0 of 0.4 .
NaCl was then added to a final concentration of 0.3 M , and levels of alkaline phosphatase were measured in samples taken at different times after the addition of NaCl .

DISCUSSION A crucial virulence attribute of all Salmonella species is their ability to penetrate epithelial cells .
The complexity of this event is suggested by the large number of genes involved , as indicated by the relatively large number of mutations that affect the ability of Salmonella species to penetrate tissue culture cells ( 11 , 14 ; J. E. Galan and R. Curtiss III , unpublished data ) .
These data may also indicate that perhaps Salmonella species can use different pathways of invasion , which seems likely considering both the central importance of this event in their life cycles and the great variety of hosts that Salmonella species are able to infect by similar routes of entry .
Coordinate regulation of gene expression is an emerging theme in bacterial pathogenesis , and several global regulatory networks that operate under different stimuli are beginning to be characterized ( 18 , 42 ) .
In Salmonella species , for example , it is now clear that phoP is a global regulator that governs the ability of these organisms to survive inside macrophages ( 8 , 13 , 43 ) .
Finlay et al. ( 10 ) have recently reported that certain Salmonella genes required for attachment and invasion are induced upon contact with cultured epithelial cells .
In order to study the regulation of a group of invasion genes that we have recently cloned and characterized ( 14 ) , we constructed translational and transcriptional phoA and cat fusions to one of these inv genes ( invA ) .
We chose to construct invA fusions because invA is the proximal gene in the invABC operon and insertions in this gene eliminate the expression of invB and invC .
We then examined the effect of several environmental stimuli on the level of expression of invA by measuring the levels of alkaline phosphatase or CAT activity in mutants grown under different conditions .
We found that when strains containing these fusions ( i.e. , X4108 and X4115 ) were grown in media with high - osmolarity achieved by the addition of 0.3 M NaCl or 0.6 M sucrose , the level of invA transcription was approximately eightfold higher than that of strains grown in media with low - osmolarity .
In contrast , strains with two randomly chosen TnphoA fusions ( i.e. , X4109 and X4110 ) obtained from a S. typhimurium insertion library did not exhibit this effect ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 30 ( Table 2 ) .
ompC and ompF are two well - characterized osmoinducible genes of S. typhimurium and E. coli that encode two outer membrane porins , and their expression is coordinately regulated by the ompB locus , composed of the ompR and envZ genes ( 22 ) .
ompR mutants of S. typhimurium have been reported to be avirulent , while ompF and ompC mutants retained virulence ( 5 ) .
These data suggest the possibility that other virulence genes are regulated by ompR .
Since Salmonella inv genes are also osmoinducible , we tested the possibility that invA may also be regulated by ompR by constructing invA ompR isogenic mutants of S. typhimurium SR11 .
The presence of an ompR mutation did not significantly affect the expression of invA , indicating that osmoinduction of invA is independent of the ompB regulatory network .
Higgins et al. ( 23 ) have recently reported that the regulation of expression of the osmoinducible gene proU is determined by changes in DNA supercoiling in response to different environmental stimuli .
These investigators demonstrated that the growth of cells at high - osmolarity leads to an increase in the mean negative superhelix density of chromosomal DNA and this causes the induction of proU expression .
The level of supercoiling of the DNA in bacteria is mostly maintained by the coordinate action of two enzymes : DNA gyrase ( encoded by the gyrA and gyrB genes ) , which introduces negative supercoils in an energy - dependent manner , and DNA topoisomerase I ( encoded by the topA gene ) , which removes negative supercoils in an energy - independent fashion ( 6 , 52 ) .
We tested the influence of the degree of DNA supercoiling on the expression of invA by measuring the level of expression of invA in cells grown at high - osmolarity in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of coumermycin A1 or novobiocin .
These antibiotics inhibit the B subunit of DNA gyrase and therefore cause a reduction in the negative supercoiling of the DNA ( 6 ) .
Increasing amounts of coumermycin A1 or novobiocin decreased the level of expression of invA , as well as of proU ( Table 3 ) .
In contrast , these antibiotics increased or did not affect the expression of two random TnphoA fusions in S. typhimurium SR11 .
These results indicate that increased relaxation of the DNA causes a decrease in the expression of invA .
In fact , the expression of invA was also lower ( twofold ) when cells were grown at 28 °C ( data not shown ) , a condition that is also known to cause a reduction in the linking number of DNA ( 16 ) .
The sensitivity of invA expression to DNA supercoiling was further confirmed by the fact that this gene was poorly expressed in a AtopA mutant of S. typhimurium regardless of the osmotic conditions ( Table 4 ) .
It is likely that the DNA in this mutant is supercoiled beyond the optimal level for the expression of invA .
Nevertheless , we were not successful in reversing the effect of the AtopA mutation by using DNA - gyrase - inhibitors .
This is not a surprising finding since fine modulation of DNA supercoiling 1884 GALAN AND CURTISS with gyrase inhibitors is complex .
Under certain conditions ( i.e. , low concentrations ) gyrase inhibitors can also increase supercoiling by stimulating gyrA transcription ( 12 ) .
We were interested in determining if our findings on the differential expression of invA under different conditions translated into a biological effect .
In fact , mouse - virulent S. typhimurium strains X3181 and X3339 grown under low osmotic conditions were significantly impaired in their ability to penetrate tissue culture cells , compared with their growth under high osmotic conditions ( Table 5 ) .
A topA mutant of the partially virulent S. typhimurium LT - 2 strain ( PM233 ) was also impeded in its ability to invade MDCK cells ( Table 5 ) .
In addition , the kinetics of induction of the expression of invA after the addition of 0.3 M NaCl closely correlated with an increase in the ability of a wild - type virulent S. typhimurium strain to invade tissue culture cells after a shift from low - osmolarity to high - osmolarity medium ( Fig. 1 ) .
These data taken together further suggest that DNA supercoiling has an effect on the expression of genes involved in S. typhimurium invasion .
There is cumulative evidence that demonstrates that promoter function can be affected both in - vivo and in - vitro by the degree of DNA supercoiling ( 41 , 52 , 60 ) .
In one study Jovanovich and Lebowitz ( 28 ) examined the effect of coumermycin A1 on the expression of 67 random Mu dl - 8 Lac ' operon fusions to random S. typhimurium promoters .
They found that this drug increased the expression of 70 % of the fusions , decreased the expression of 16 % , and did not affect 13 % .
These studies suggest that most of the promoters in S. typhimurium are affected in - vivo by changes in the negative superhelicity of the DNA .
It has been shown that a number of environmental stimuli such as osmolarity ( 19 , 23 ) , temperature ( 17 ) , oxygen levels ( 4 , 32 , 62 ) , and starvation ( 1 , 4 ) affect DNA supercoiling .
It therefore seems probable that pathogenic organisms make use of this system to regulate the expression of virulence genes in response to a diversity of stimuli .
This regulatory network may operate by directly influencing the expression of a given virulence gene or , alternatively , by affecting the expression of regulatory genes that control the expression of additional virulence genes .
The regulation of the inv genes of S. typhimurium by changes in the degree of DNA supercoiling may be an example of the end effect of such a regulatory network .
At present it is not known if the inv promoters themselves are sensitive to supercoiling or if an as yet unidentified gene whose promoter is sensitive to changes in DNA superhelicity modulates their expression .
It is noteworthy that conditions of temperature and osmolarity found in the intestinal tract are optimal for the expression of S. typhimurium genes that are uniquely necessary in that environment for display of virulence ( 14 ) .
We thank Robert G. Kranz for useful discussions and Eric Eisenstadt for providing bacterial strains and for useful suggestions regarding the isolation of TnphoA insertion mutants of S. typhimurium .
