Abstract Background : The type III secretion system ( TTSS ) is an important virulence determinant of Gram - negative bacterial pathogens .
It enables the injection of effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells .
These effectors ultimately manipulate the cellular functions of the infected organism .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes two virulence associated TTSSs encoded by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands ( SPI ) 1 and 2 that are required for the intestinal and systemic phases of the infection , respectively .
However , recent studies suggest that the roles of these TTSSs are not restricted to these compartments .
The regulation of TTSSs in Salmonella is very complex with several regulators operating to activate or to repress expression depending on the environmental conditions .
Results : We performed a systematic analysis of the regulation of type III effectors during - growth in - vitro .
We have tested the ability of seven regulatory genes to regulate ten effector genes .
Each regulator was expressed in the absence of the other six to avoid cascade effects .
Our results confirm and extend the previously reported regulation of TTSS1 and TTSS2 effectors by InvF - SicA and SsrB respectively .
Conclusion : The set of strains constructed for this study can be used to quickly and systematically study the regulation of newly identified effector genes of Salmonella enterica .
The approach we have used can also be applied to study complex regulatory cascades in other bacterial species .
Background The type III secretion system ( TTSS ) is a complex molecular machine found in numerous Gram - negative bacterial pathogens of animals and plants [ 1 ] .
This secretion system encodes a syringe - like organelle that injects effector proteins directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells .
The effectors ultimately affect host cell physiology .
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ( hereafter referred to simply as Typhimurium ) possesses two virulence associated TTSSs encoded by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands ( SPI ) 1 and 2 [ 2 ] .
TTSS1 ( encoded by SPI1 ) delivers effectors that mediate the invasion of epithelial cells and the intestinal events of Typhimurium infection [ 3 - 5 ] .
TTSS2 is required during the systemic phase of Typhimurium infection [ 6 ] .
It secretes effectors that allow the sur - Page 1 of 12 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2007 , 7:3 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/7/3 vival and multiplication of the pathogen within macrophages [ 7 ] .
The regulation of the Typhimurium TTSSs is complex with several regulatory proteins involved ( Figure 1 ) .
SPI1 encodes five regulators , four of which are known to be involved in regulatory cascades that lead to the expression of genes inside and outside of SPI1 [ 8 ] .
The central regulator of SPI1 gene expression is HilA , a member of the OmpR/ToxR family [ 5,8 ] .
HilA directly activates the expression of two SPI1 operons that encode TTSS1 apparatus components [ 5,9 ] .
One of these operons begins with the invF gene , which encodes a transcriptional activator of the AraC family .
InvF activates the expression of TTSS1 effectors encoded both inside and outside of SPI1 [ 10,11 ] .
The activity of InvF requires the SicA co - regulator which is also encoded within SPI1 [ 12,13 ] .
The third and fourth regulators are HilC and HilD , both of which belong to the AraC family .
Both can directly activate the expression of hilA [ 14,15 ] .
They can also activate the expression of the invF operon independently of HilA [ 16,17 ] .
The fifth regulator encoded within SPI1 , SprB , contains a LuxR/UhpA helix - turn - helix motif , however no target genes for SprB have been identified [ 18 ] .
SPI1 gene expression is also regulated by factors encoded outside of SPI1 ( Figure 1A ) .
The SirA/BarA two - component system is an ancient regulatory system with orthologs found throughout the γ - proteobacteria that is involved in virulence gene expression , exoenzyme and antibiotic production , motility , and biofilm formation [ 19,20 ] .
In Typhimurium , SirA has been shown to bind and activate the promoters of hilC and hilA [ 21 ] , although an alternate model has also been proposed in which SirA acts through hilD rather than through hilA and hilC [ 22 ] .
Additional regulators of SPI1 gene expression encoded outside of SPI1 include the two - component regulatory systems PhoPQ [ 23 ] , PhoBR [ 24 ] , and OmpR/EnvZ [ 24 ] , and the AraC - like transcriptional activator RtsA [ 25 ] .
How these regulatory inputs are integrated is not yet known .
The central regulator of SPI2 , and some TTSS2 effector genes located outside of SPI2 , is the SsrAB two - component system [ 26 ] .
SsrB has been shown to bind and activate the promoter of the srfH/sseI gene that encodes a TTSS2 effector [ 27 ] .
Similarly , SsrB is thought to directly activate the expression of SPI2 operons as well as other A - SPI1 B - SPI2 RtsA PhoP HilC HilD OmpR SlyA SirA HilA SsrAB InvF SicA Effectors Effectors Regulatory Figure 1 cascades activating the expression of SPI1 ( A ) and SPI2 ( B ) related type III effectors Regulatory cascades activating the expression of SPI1 ( A ) and SPI2 ( B ) related type III effectors .

The expression of ssrA and ssrB is activated by factors encoded outside of SPI2 ( Figure 1B ) .
These include the twocomponent systems OmpR/EnvZ [ 30 ] , PhoPQ [ 31 ] , and the slyA gene [ 32 ] .
Recently the ydgT gene was identified as a negative regulator of SPI2 gene expression [ 33 ] .
The effectors secreted by TTSS1 are required for the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells [ 4,34 ] .
In contrast , the SPI2 genes are induced after Typhimurium has invaded or is phagocytized by eukaryotic cells [ 29,31,35 - 37 ] .
These observations led to the hypothesis that TTSS1 is needed to invade intestinal cells , but is not required during the subsequent phases of Typhimurium pathogenesis , while TTSS2 is expressed only when the bacteria reside within eukaryotic cells .
Several recent reports suggest a more complicated role of the Typhimurium TTSSs .
For example , SPI1 mutants have a replication defect and are unable to synthesize a normal SCV inside epithelial cells suggesting that SPI1 genes are involved in these functions [ 38 ] .
Conversely , SPI2 genes have been shown to be involved in the induction of the inflammatory response caused by S. enterica serovar Dublin in a bovine ligated - ileal - loop model [ 39 ] and to be essential for the full virulence of Typhimurium in murine infectious enterocolitis [ 40,41 ] .
These results suggest that each TTSS might be expressed in different compartments within the host , and that at least some effectors might be involved in more than one phase of the infection .
Given the complexity of these regulatory hierarchies , we took a systematic in - vitro approach to categorizing the regulatory inputs of effector genes in Typhimurium .
Besides examining the effects of individual regulatory mutations on individual effectors , we wanted to test each regulatory gene in the absence of other regulators .
For example , the regulatory hierarchy for SPI1 is complex in that SirA activates hilA and hilC , HilC also activates hilA , and HilA and HilC in turn activate invF .
InvF combined with SicA then activates effector genes .
Since mutations anywhere in the cascade can cause loss of effector gene expression , we chose to test individual members of the cascade for activation of each effector in the absence of all other members of the cascade .
This type of approach could reveal if , for instance , sirA , hilA , or hilC can regulate any effectors independently of invF .
This approach might also reveal novel regulatory patterns for individual effectors , for example , effector genes regulated by both SPI1 and SPI2 regulators .
Therefore , in this report we have examined the effects of seven regulatory genes on ten effector genes .
The expression of each effector gene was examined in a set of strains lacking all but one of the seven regulators .
Our results confirm and extend the known regulation of TTSS1 and TTSS2 effectors by invF - sicA and ssrB respectively .
Results and discussion Construction of Typhimurium multi - regulator mutant strains harboring lacZY fusions to type III effector genes We constructed a Typhimurium strain that lacks seven regulators , six of which are known to affect the expression of the type III secretion systems of this bacterium .
The TTSS1 - encoding region of SPI1 , which harbors five regulatory genes ( hilC , hilD , hilA , invF and sprB ) and a co - regulator ( sicA ) , was deleted in a strain that harbors a mutation of the sirA gene ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Transduction of an ssrB mutation into this strain resulted in YD038 which lacks seven regulatory genes ( hereafter known as the multi - mutant ) .
Chromosomal lacZY transcriptional fusions to ten effector genes were then constructed in YD038 .
These included fusions to genes that encode effectors secreted by TTSS1 ( sopA , sopB and sopE2 ) , TTSS2 ( sspH2 , sifA , sifB , sseI , and sseG ) or both ( slrP and sspH1 ) .
These ten fusions were also transduced into the wild type strain , 14028 , using phage P22HTint .
Effects of individual regulators on the expression of the type III secreted effectors Low copy number plasmids individually encoding seven regulators of SPI1 or SPI2 ( or the vector control ) were transformed into each of the ten strains that carry a lacZY fusion in the multi - mutant background .
Each plasmid was constructed in such a way as to have the regulatory gene expressed from the vector 's lac promoter .
Expression and regulatory activity of the resulting constructs was confirmed using complementation tests with known target genes ( Figure 2 ) .
The only exception was sprB for which the target genes are not known .
The resulting 80 strains ( and the ten additional strains harboring the same fusions in the wild - type background ) were then grown in triplicate to log phase under either SPI1 - inducing conditions ( LB broth standing at 37 °C overnight [ 42 ] ) or SPI2 - inducing conditions ( MgM broth shaking at 37 °C until OD 595 of 0.2 to 0.8 ) .
The β - galactosidase activity of the strains was then determined .
The results of SPI1 - inducing conditions are shown in Table 1 and the results of SPI2 - inducing conditions are shown in Table 2 .
For all of the discussion below , any effect less than 3 - fold is considered to be no effect .
• TTSS1 effectors Regardless of growth - conditions , the fusions to sopA , sopB , and sopE2 produced more β - galactosidase in the wild type than in the multi - mutant vector control suggesting that a regulatory factor is missing in the multi - mutant ( Tables 1 and 2 ) .
For sopA the invF - sicA plasmid was the only plasmid that restored expression .
Expression of the sopB fusion was also restored by the invF - sicA plasmid .
These results confirm previous findings in which invF - sicA activates sopA and sopB [ 10,25 ] .
Interestingly , the ssrB plasmid also partially restored sopB expression , but only in SPI1 - Page 3 of 12 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2007 , 7:3 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/7/3 A. invF : : Tn5 - lac B. sopB - lac C. srfH : : MudJ WT WT + vector WT + p - hilC WT hilD hilD + vector hilD + p - hilD WT hilA hilA + vector hilA + p - hilA WT sirA sirA + vector sirA + p - sirA WT invF invF + vector invF + p - invF - sicA sicA sicA + vector sicA + p - invF - sicA WT ssrB ssrB + vector ssrB + p - ssrB - galactosidase activity ( Miller units ) - galactosidase activity ( Miller units ) - galactosidase activity ( Miller units ) Figure Functional 2 verification of regulator - encoding plasmids Functional verification of regulator - encoding plasmids .
Each regulatory gene , cloned into the pWSK29 vector , was introduced into a strain containing a mutation of the corresponding regulator and a lacZY reporter to a gene known to be activated by the regulator ( The hilC - encoding plasmid was introduced into the wild type strain and compared to the control vector ) .
β - galactosidase assays were performed on log - phase cultures ( using ONPG ) and the results represent a mean of at least three independent assays .
( A ) An invF : : Tn5 - lacZY reporter was used to verify the plasmids encoding hilA , hilC , hilD and sirA .
( B ) A sopB - lacZY fusion was used for the plasmid encoding invF and sicA ; and ( C ) , a srfH : : MudJ reporter for the plasmid encoding ssrB .
This is a novel result but the effect of ssrB is quite small compared to the effect of invF so it is not clear if it is physiologically relevant .
The expression of the sopE2 fusion was decreased in the multi - mutant background and the invF - sicA plasmid restored expression ( Tables 1 and 2 ) .
The activation of sopE2 by invF - sicA has not been previously reported .
However , a homolog of sopE2 , the sopE gene , has been shown to be regulated by invF - sicA [ 12 ] .
The sopE2 gene is present in all Salmonella serovars examined to date , while the presence of sopE is sporadic [ 43 ] .
The sopE gene was not included in this study because it is not present in our wildtype 14028 strain .
Our results suggest that in addition to their similar function , sopE and sopE2 are both regulated by invF - sicA .
Additionally , all of the above results indicate that the regulators above invF in the SPI1 regulatory cascade ( sirA , hilA , hilC , hilD ) can not regulate sopA , sopB , or sopE2 in the absence of invF .
• slrP and sspH1 SspHl and SlrP are known to be secreted by both TTSS1 and TTSS2 [ 28,44 ] .
The sspH1 fusion was not decreased in the multi - mutant background compared to the wild - type in either SPI1 or SPI2 - inducing conditions , suggesting that none of the seven regulators control sspH1 .
However , the invF - sicA plasmid activated the sspH1 fusion by 4 - fold compared to the vector control in SPI1 - inducing conditions ( Table 1 ) .
Previously Miao and Miller found that the expression of sspH1 is constitutive [ 44 ] , so it is not clear if the 4 - fold effect of a plasmid - encoded regulator is physiologically significant .
Expression of the slrP fusion did not decrease in the multimutant background in either growth - condition , but it was activated 12 - fold and 4 - fold in the presence of the sprB and invF - sicA plasmids , respectively .
This effect was only seen in SPI1 - inducing conditions .
Both of these results are interesting since no target has been identified for sprB , and invF - sicA was not known to regulate slrP .
It has been reported that while chromosomal hilC and hilD have no effect on slrP , plasmid - encoded hilC and hilD do moderately activate slrP expression [ 25 ] .
In this study , the slrP fusion was induced neither by hilC nor by hilD in the multi - mutant background suggesting that the previously observed regulation of slrP by hilC and hilD is through invF .

Page 6 of 12 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2007 , 7:3 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/7/3 introduced into an otherwise wild - type background carrying a chromosomal slrP - lacZY fusion .
None of the mutations affected the expression of the slrP fusion ( Figure 3 ) .
This is consistent with the lack of a decrease in the multimutant background and a previous report in which plasmid - encoded rtsA , hilC , and hilD had effects on slrP , but little or no difference in expression was seen with the same regulators expressed from the chromosome [ 25 ] .
• TTSS2 effectors Regardless of growth - condition , four of the five fusions to TTSS2 effector genes ( sspH2 , sifB , sseI , and sseG ) were activated by the ssrB - encoding plasmid ( Tables 1 and 2 ) .
This confirms the known activation of these genes by the ssrAB two - component system [ 29,44,45 ] .
Expression of the sifA fusion was not affected in the multi - mutant background compared to the wild - type , regardless of growth - condition .
Additionally , none of the plasmid - encoded regulators altered sifA expression .
This result was unexpected since the expression of sifA has previously been shown to depend on ssrA , which encodes the sensor kinase component of the SsrAB two - component system [ 44 ] .
To try to reconcile this discrepancy , we constructed a second chromosomal lac fusion to sifA using the method developed by Ellermeier et al. ( see Methods ) .
This fusion was moved into the wild type and the multi - mutant backgrounds .
The multi - mutant strain was then transformed with the ssrB - encoding plasmid or the pWSK29 vector .
This sifA fusion was not regulated by ssrB under SPI1 - inducing conditions and was only regulated 2 - fold under - galactosidase activity ( normalized light ) 100 10 1 slrP - lacZ WT invF sicA MM + pinvF - sicA sprB MM + psprB Effect Figure of 3chromosomal regulators on the expression of slrP Effect of chromosomal regulators on the expression of slrP .

SifA expression was almost twice as high in the wild - type strain as it was in either the ∆ ssrA , ∆ ssrB , or ∆ ssrAB strains .
Furthermore , sifA expression was 2 - fold higher in the multi - mutant background containing the ssrB plasmid than it was in the vector control strain ( Table 3 ) .
To test the regulation of sifA by ssrB in another way , we constructed a plasmid that harbours the luxCDABE operon from Photorhabdus luminescens under the control of the sifA promoter .
This plasmid was placed into the wild type , the ssrA mutant , and the ssrB mutant containing either the pssrB plasmid or the vector control .
These strains were grown in LB or MgM media and the light emitted by the cells captured using a Xenogen IVIS imaging system ( Alameda , CA ) ( Figure 4A ) and measured using a luminometer ( Figure 4B ) .
The light emitted by the wild type strain is higher in MgM compared to LB showing that the PsifA promoter is induced in the MgM medium ( Figure 4 ) .
The activity of the PsifA also decreased strongly in the ssrA and the ssrB mutants after growth in both MgM and LB .
The pssrB plasmid restored the production of light in the ssrB mutant ( Figure 4 ) .
These results are consistent with previous findings that sifA is regulated by the ssrAB two - component regulatory system .
It is not clear why the regulatory effects are seen so clearly with plasmidencoded fusions and not observed with chromosomal fusions .
It is possible that additional layers of regulation are imposed on the chromosomal fusions such as supercoiling or chromatin structure that are relieved on the plasmid .
Expression of the sifB fusion was activated by ssrB , as expected [ 29,44,45 ] .
However , sifB was also repressed by sirA , hilC , and invF .
This is an interesting and novel result because a TTSS2 effector is being repressed by the SPI1 regulatory cascade .
No other effectors are activated by one system and repressed by the other .
Even more unusual is that sirA and hilC had their effects in the multi - mutant Table 3 : Regulation of sifA by ssrAB .

The light emitted by 100 microliters of culture was measured using a luminometer .
The values represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments .
This indicates that sirA and hilC are acting on sifB independently of the standard SPI1 regulatory pathway .
Conclusion We have taken a systematic approach to study the regulation of type III effector genes during - growth in - vitro .
Our results confirm that sopA and sopB are activated by invFsicA .
In addition we have determined that sopE2 and sspH1 are regulated by invF - sicA .
The regulation of sopE2 is very strong under either SPI1 or SPI2 - inducing conditions while the regulation of sspH1 is weak and only observed under SPI1 - inducing conditions .
The sspH2 , sifB , sseI and sseG fusions were shown to be strongly activated by ssrB .
The most interesting regulation was observed with sifA and sifB .
Chromosomal fusions to sifA were largely unaffected by any regulator .
However , a plasmid - based sifA fusion was strongly regulated by ssrB .
The sifB fusion was strongly regulated by ssrB , as expected .
However , it was also strongly repressed by sirA , hilC , and invF .
This is the Page 8 of 12 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2007 , 7:3 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/7/3 first indication that sirA and hilC might regulate an effector gene independently of invF .
The set of strains constructed for this study can now be used to quickly and systematically study the regulation of newly identified effector genes .
Methods Growth conditions , enzymes , reagents , and transduction The strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Additional file 1 .
The bacterial strains were grown in LB ( Luria - Bertani ) medium at 37 °C .
For induction in the Magnesium minimal - medium ( MgM ) [ 46 ] cells from LB overnight cultures were washed with MgM prior to 1:50 dilution .
The following antibiotics were obtained from Sigma and used at the following concentrations when required : kanamycin ( kan , 50 µg/ml ) , ampicillin ( amp , 100 µg/ml ) , chloramphenicol ( cam , 20 µg/ml ) , tetracycline ( tet , 20 µg/ml ) , and hygromycin ( hyg , 200 µg/ml ) .
Sucrose was supplemented at 219 mM final concentration to select against sacB .
The β - galactosidase chromogenic substrate 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - β-D - galactopyranoside ( X - Gal ) was obtained from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) and used at a final concentration of 40 µg / ml .
General molecular biology techniques were performed essentially as described [ 47 ] .
Restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA ) or New England Biolabs ( Beverly , MA ) , and used as recommended by the manufacturers .
PCR primers were purchased from IDT Inc. ( Coralville , IA ) .
Plasmids were extracted using kits from Qiagen ( Valencia , CA ) .
P22 transduction was performed as described [ 48 ] .
β - galactosidase assay The β - galactosidase activities were measured using o - nitrophenyl β - D-galactopyranoside ( ONPG , Sigma , St. Louis MO ) using the method described by Miller [ 49 ] or the Beta - Glo ™ assay system ( Promega , WI ) according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
Briefly the assay consisted of mixing an equal volume of a log phase growing culture ( OD 590 0.2 -- 0.8 ) and a detection reagent .
The latter contains ( i ) a luciferin - galactoside substrate ( 6 - O-βgalactopyranosyl - luciferin ) that is cleaved by the β - galactosidase to form luciferin and galactose , and ( ii ) a firefly luciferase that catalyzes the luciferin to generate light .
After at least 1 hour of incubation at room temperature the light produced is measured in a Turner Designs TD - 20/20 luminometer or a Wallac 1420 VICTOR 3 plate reader and the results expressed as light per OD 595 per µl of culture .
The results were expressed as the mean ± SD of at least three different experiments .
Mutation of regulatory genes The invF , sicA , sprB , ssrA , and ssrB genes were replaced with the cat cassette from pKD3 using the λ - red recombination system as described [ 50 ] .
Construction of a multi - regulator mutant strain The TTSS genes of SPI1 ( ~ 35 kb ) , but not the manganese transport genes [ 51 ] , were deleted using the pRE112 suicide vector [ 52 ] .
This deleted avrA through invH .
To do this , PCR was performed using primers BA1093 and BA1094 ( see Additional file 2 ) with 14028 genomic DNA as template .
The 1366 bp product contains the 3 ' end of the invH gene , stm2901 , and the 5 ' end of stm2902 .
A second PCR was performed using primers BA1095 and BA1096 ( see Additional file 2 ) .
The 1255 bp product contains the 3 ' end of sitC , the sitD gene , and the 5 ' part of the avrA gene .
Both products were cloned into pCR2 .1 Topo ( Invitrogen ) .
The sitD - containing fragment was removed with SacI and cloned into the SacI site of the stm2901 - containing clone .
This placed the two fragments adjacent to each other and created the ∆ ( avrA - invH ) 1 deletion .
This 2894 bp fragment was removed with KpnI and PvuII and cloned into the suicide vector pRE112 that had been digested with KpnI and SmaI to yield the plasmid pYD25 .
This plasmid contains ( i ) a cat gene that confers a resistance to chloramphenicol , ( ii ) the R6K replication origin that requires the pir gene , and ( iii ) the sacB gene of Bacillus subtilis that is toxic in Gram - negative bacteria grown in the presence of high concentrations of sucrose [ 53 ] .
Allelic exchange was performed by mobilizing pYD25 from BW20767 into JVR140 ( sirA4 : : hyg ) .
The chloramphenicol resistant transconjugants harbor the pYD25 plasmid integrated into the chromosome , resulting in the duplication of the region upstream and downstream of TTSS1 .
Isolated colonies were grown in LB without - chloramphenicol selection until the exponential phase and plated onto LB lacking NaCl and containing 219 mM sucrose to select for loss of the integrated plasmid by homologous recombination .
The colonies obtained were screened for ∆ ( avrAinvH ) 1 using PCR with primers hybridizing upstream and downstream of the TTSS1 region .
Finally , the resulting ∆ ( avrA - invH ) 1 sirA4 : : hyg strain was used as a recipient for the P22HTint transduction of an ssrB : : cat mutation from MJW129 [ 29 ] to make the multi - mutant YD038 strain .
YD038 lacks the co - regulator sicA , and seven regulators , sirA , ssrB , hilA , hilC , hilD , invF , and sprB .
Construction of lacZY fusions to effector genes To make lacZY transcriptional - fusions to effector genes , the 3 ' portion of each gene ( including the stop codon but without the transcription terminator ) was amplified using PCR and cloned into pCR2 .1 TOPO ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) .
These gene portions were then removed as EcoRI fragments and cloned into the EcoRI site upstream of the promoterless lacZY gene of the pVIK112 pir - Page 9 of 12 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2007 , 7:3 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/7/3 dependent suicide vector [ 54 ] .
The resulting plasmids were mobilized from BW20767 into YD038 .
The correct integration of the plasmids into the chromosome of the resulting kanamycin - resistant transconjugants was verified by PCR .
Fusions were transduced using phage P22HTint into other backgrounds as needed .
A second fusion to sifA was constructed as described previously [ 55 ] .
First the lambda red recombination system was used to integrate a kanamycin resistance gene flanked by FRT ( Flp recombinase target ) sites from the pKD4 plasmid [ 50 ] .
The FRT - kan - FRT cassette was placed after the stop codon , but before the transcription terminator , of sifA .
Second , the temperature sensitive pCP20 plasmid [ 56 ] that encodes Flp recombinase was introduced into the strain .
Flp - mediated excision of the kan cassette left a single FRT site that serves as an integration point for the fusion .
The third step was to integrate the pCE36 suicide plasmid that has a FRT site directly upstream of the promoterless lacZY [ 55 ] .
After the integration of pCE36 , the pCP20 plasmid was cured by growth at 37 °C .
Construction of plasmids encoding regulators of the Salmonella type III secretion systems Each of the regulatory genes missing in the multi - mutant was amplified using PCR ( the primers used are described in Additional file 2 ) , cloned into the pCR2 .1 TOPO vector , released by enzymatic digestion and cloned under the control of the lac promoter of pWSK29 .
The hilD , sirA , and hilA genes were released from the TOPO vector as 1353 bp SacI - XbaI , 936 bp KpnI - XhoI , and 1920 bp EcoRI fragments respectively and cloned into the corresponding sites of pWSK29 to yield the plasmids pYD17 , pYD28 and pYD29 respectively .
The 971 bp SpeI - XhoI fragment containing the sprB gene was cloned into the XbaI - XhoI sites of pWSK29 to give the pYD15 plasmid .
The hilC gene was released as a 1541 bp PvuII - XbaI fragment and ligated to the EcoRV - XbaI sites of pWSK29 to produce the plasmid pYD16 .
A 852 bp EcoRI fragment and a 622 bp KpnI - XhoI fragment containing the invF and the sicA genes were cloned into the corresponding sites of pWSK29 to yield the plasmids pYD23 and pYD38 respectively .
The 5353 bp ApaLI - XhoI fragment from pYD23 was ligated to the 1527 ApaLI - XhoI fragment from pYD38 to give the pYD40 plasmid that harbours the invF and sicA genes as a bi - cistronic operon under the control of the lac promoter .
Each construction was verified by the complementation of a corresponding regulatory mutant ( Figure 2 ) , except for sprB for which a complementable function has not yet been discovered [ 18 ] .
We sequenced both strands of the P lac - sprB region of the sprB - encoding plasmid to ensure that the sequence was correct .
Construction of the PsifA - lux reporter plasmid The promoter region and the 5 ` part of the sifA gene was PCR - amplified from 14028 genomic DNA using the primers YD1 and YD2 ( see Additional file 2 ) .
The product was cloned into the pCR2 .1 TOPO vector ( Invitrogen ) and then released as an EcoRI fragment that was subsequently cloned upstream of the luxCDABE operon of the pSB384 vector [ 57 ] .
The correct orientation of the PsifA promoter in the resulting pYD56 plasmid was verified by PCR .
Cell imaging and luminometry Liquid cultures were grown in LB or MgM media for six hours .
The cultures were brought to similar OD 600 and 200 µl of cell suspensions were placed in tubes and imaged using the Xenogen IVIS imaging system ( Alameda , CA ) .
The images are displayed as pseudocolors with blue representing the lowest and red the highest light intensity .
For luminometry the light emitted by 100 µl of culture was measured using a Turner Designs TD - 20 / 20 luminometer .
