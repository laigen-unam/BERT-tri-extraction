The expression of csrB and csrC genes , which are located in different chromosomal regions , is coordinated by positive transcriptional control mediated by the two - component regulatory system BarA/SirA .
Here , we identified by computational analysis an 18 - bp inverted repeat ( IR ) sequence located far upstream from the promoter of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium csrB and csrC genes .
Deletion analysis and site - directed mutagenesis of the csrB and csrC regulatory regions revealed that this IR sequence is required for transcriptional activation of both genes .
Protein - DNA and proteinprotein interaction assays showed that the response regulator SirA specifically binds to the IR sequence and provide evidence that SirA acts as a dimer .
Interestingly , whereas the IR sequence was essential for the SirA - mediated expression of csrB , our results revealed that SirA controls the expression of csrC not only by binding to the IR sequence but also by an indirect mode involving the Csr system .
Additional computational , biochemical , and genetic analyses demonstrated that the integration host factor ( IHF ) global regulator positively controls the expression of csrB , but not of csrC , by interacting with a sequence located between the promoter and the SirA - binding site .
These findings contribute to the better understanding of the regulatory mechanism controlling the expression of CsrB and CsrC .
The knowledge of small RNAs ( sRNAs ) as regulatory factors for gene expression in bacteria has greatly increased in the recent years ( 1 , 2 ) .
In Escherichia coli , CsrB and CsrC sRNAs indirectly regulate the expression of many genes encoding different cellular functions , including central carbon metabolism , motility , biofilm formation , and virulence ( 3 , 4 ) .
CsrB and CsrC have multiple binding sites for CsrA , a protein that binds sequences located nearby or overlapping the Shine - Dalgarno sequence in target mRNAs , thus blocking ribosome binding and translation and promoting mRNA degradation ( 3 -- 6 ) .
Therefore , CsrB and CsrC induce gene expression by sequestering CsrA and thus antagonizing its translational repression activity .
Expression of csrB and csrC , which are located in different chromosomal regions , is transcriptionally regulated by the two - component system BarA/UvrY , where BarA is the sensor kinase protein and UvrY is the DNAbinding response regulator ( 7 , 8 ) .
Orthologous of BarA/UvrY , CsrB/CsrC , and CsrA have been identified in many other gammaproteobacteria , including Salmonella enterica ( BarA/SirA , CsrB/CsrC , and CsrA ) , Pseudomonas species ( GacS/GacA , RsmX/RsmY/RsmZ , and RsmA ) , Vibrio species ( VarS/VarA , CsrB/CsrC/CsrD , and CsrA ) , Erwinia carotovora ( ExpS/ExpA , RsmB , and RsmA ) , and Legionella pneumophila ( LetS/LetA , RsmY/RsmZ , and CsrA ) , where they also control the expression of many genes required for a wide variety of cellular functions ( 4 -- 8 ) .
Notably , in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) the two - component system BarA / SirA induces parallel expression of csrB and csrC when bacteria grow in the nutrient - rich Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium at 37 °C ( 9 -- 11 ) .
Under these growth - conditions , CsrB and CsrC counteract CsrA - mediated translational repression of hilD , thereby allowing the synthesis of HilD , which in turn positively controls the regulatory cascade leading to the expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes that have essential roles in Salmonella virulence ( 11 -- 15 ) .
Short - chain fatty - acids , such as acetate , generated as a metabolic end product in E. coli ( and probably in Salmonella ) when bacteria grow in LB - medium and found in the intestines of animals , stimulate the activity of the BarA/SirA ( UvrY ) system and thus activate the expression of csrB and csrC in these bacteria ( 16 , 17 ) .
Even though previous studies have shown that the response regulator SirA interacts with the regulatory regions of both csrB and csrC ( 10 , 11 , 18 ) , the specific sequence recognized by SirA , as well as other possible regulatory elements required for the coordinated expression of these genes , have not been determined .
Advances in computational biology have provided a large number of bioinformatics resources to analyze gene regulation .
Particularly , different computational tools and methodologies are now available for the systematic discovery of cis - acting regulatory sequences , including transcription factor binding sites ( 19 ) .
Here , by combining bioinformatics and experimental strategies , we determined that SirA induces expression of csrB and csrC by binding to an 18 - pb IR sequence located far upstream from the Published ahead of print 1 November 2013 Address correspondence to Víctor H.

Furthermore , we found that SirA also controls the expression of csrC by an indirect mode , which involves the Csr system , and that the integration host factor ( IHF ) positively regulates csrB , but not csrC , by interacting with a sequence located between the promoter and the SirA - binding site .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bioinformatics analysis .
Computational analyses were performed using the regulatory sequence analysis tools ( RSAT ) ( 20 , 21 ) .
Since we know that most regulatory sequences are present within the 400 - bp upstream region ( 22 ) , we extracted for analyses this upstream sequence of the following genes : csrB and csrC from S. Typhimurium LT2 , as well as csrB and csrC from Escherichia coli K - 12 , csrB1 and csrB2 from Vibrio cholerae O1 biovar El Tor strain N16961 , rsmY and rsmZ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa LESB58 , rsmY and rsmZ from Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 , and rsmB from Erwinia carotovora SCRI1043 .
The phylogenetic footprinting analysis of these upstream sequences was performed as follows : ( i ) conserved sequences ( dyads ) were detected by consecutively using the dyad analysis and DNA pattern programs , ( ii ) overlapped dyads with a higher significance were selected , and ( iii ) a 9 - bp position - specific scoring matrix ( PSSM ) was generated by using the selected dyads and the consensus program .
Stringent scanning of the upstream sequences of tested genes , with the PSSMs generated here and with the 86 high - quality PSSMs from the RegulonDB database version 8.0 ( 23 ) , was performed with the matrix scan program using a P value of 1e -- 4 ( where P is the probability of obtaining a given `` weight score '' [ a value indicating the significance of the prediction ] by chance ) .
The resulting hits are reported with a corresponding weight score .
The default parameters were used in all of these computational programs unless otherwise indicated .
Results from chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) and - galactosidase assays were analyzed using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to determine whether at least one mean value differed from any of the others .
The Tukey 's multiple comparison post test was then used to determine which mean values were statistically different .
A P value of 0.05 was considered significant .
This statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5 program version 5.04 ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA ) .
Bacterial strains and growth - conditions .
Bacterial strains used in the present study are described in Table 1 .
Bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB - medium containing 1 % tryptone , 0.5 % yeast extract , and 1 % NaCl at pH 7.5 .
When necessary , media were supplemented with the following antibiotics : ampicillin ( 200 g/ml ) , streptomycin ( 100 g/ml ) , tetracycline ( 10 g/ml ) , or kanamycin ( 20 g/ml ) .
Cultures for the determination of CAT activity and for the LexA - based genetic system assays were performed as described previously ( 11 ) ; the culture samples for these analyses were taken at the indicated times .
Construction of the himA : : kan and sirA csrA : : kan mutant strains .
The himA gene was replaced with a selectable kanamycin resistance cassette in S. Typhimurium SL1344 strain by the Red recombinase system , as reported previously ( 24 ) , generating the himA : : kan mutant strain ( JPTM46 ) .
The csrA : : kan allele from strain JPTM44 was transferred to strain JPTM27 by P22 transduction , generating the sirA csrA : : kan double mutant strain ( JPTM47 ) .
The mutant strains were verified by PCR amplification and sequencing .

The PCR products were digested with HindIII and BamHI restriction enzymes and then cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of plasmid pKK232 - 8 , which carries a promoterless cat gene ( Amersham Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology ) , generating plasmids pcsrB - 370 , pcsrB - 230 , pcsrB - cat - 170 , pcsrB - 114 , pcsrB - cat - 50 , pcsrC - 239 , and pcsrC - 119 .
Mutation of the conserved sequence R1 or R2 of the csrB - 370 or csrC - 350 fusions ( see Fig. 3B and 6A ) were introduced by overlapping PCR .
To modify R1 or R2 in the csrB - 370 fusion , two overlapping PCR products spanning the regulatory region of csrB , containing the respective mutations , were obtained by using primer pairs CsrB - Fw1 / BFw - MU11 and CsrB - 370Rv / BRv - MU22 for R1 or CsrB - Fw1 / BFw - MU33 and CsrB - 370Rv/BRv - MU 44 for R2 .
The PCR products were purified , mixed for each case , and used as the templates for a second PCR amplification with the external primers CsrB - Fw1 and CsrB - 370Rv .
The final PCR products were digested with HindIII and BamHI restriction enzymes and then cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of plasmid pKK232 - 8 , generating plasmids pcsrB - 370R1 * and pcsrB - 370R2 * .
A similar strategy was followed to modify R1 or R2 in csrC - 350 , using the primer pairs CRC - HRV1 / CFwMu55 and CRC - BFw1 / CRv - MU66 for R1 or CRC - HRV1 / CFwMU77 and CRC - BFw1 / CRv - MU88 for R2 , and the external primers CRC - BFw1 and CRC - HRV1 for the second PCR amplification in both cases , generating plasmids pcsrC - 350R1 * and pcsrC - 350R2 * .
To construct the plasmids containing the csrC - 350 3 , csrC - 350R1 * 3 , csrC - cat - 119 3 , and csrB - 370 2 transcriptional - fusions , a PCR product was obtained with primer pair CsrC - RvH3 / PKKSEQ2 ( for the csrC - cat fusions ) or CsrB - FwH3 / PKKSEQ2 ( for the csrB - cat fusion ) , using as the templates the plasmids pcsrC - 350 , pcsrC - 350R1 * , pcsrC - 119 , and pcsrB - 370 , respectively .
The PCR products were digested with HindIII and BamHI restriction enzymes and then cloned into vector pKK232 - 8 digested with the same restriction enzymes , generating plasmids pcsrC - 350 3 , pcsrC - 350R1 * 3 , pcsrC - 119 3 , and pcsrB - 370 2 .
To construct the plasmid pSR660 - SirA , expressing the LexA DBD - SirA fusion protein , the sirA gene was amplified by PCR using primers SirA - HisA - F and SirAR - LexA .
The resulting PCR product was digested with BglII and KpnI and cloned into vector pSR660 digested with the same restriction enzymes .

Electrophoretic mobility - shift assays ( EMSAs ) .
Fragments of the regulatory region of csrB or csrC ( csrB - 370 , csrB - 230 , csrB - 170 , csrB - 114 , csrB - 370R1 * , csrB - 370R2 * , csrC - 350 , csrC - 239 , csrC - 119 , csrC - 350R1 * , and csrC - 350R2 * ) were obtained by PCR amplification with the same primer pairs used to construct the respective csrB - cat or csrC - cat fusion .
A fragment containing the regulatory region of sigD , used as a negative internal control in the DNA binding reactions , was also obtained by PCR with the primer pair sigDBH1F and sigDH3R .
PCR products were purified by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit ( Qiagen ) .
Binding reactions were performed by mixing 100 ng of each PCR product with 100 ng of the sigD fragment ( negative control ) and increasing concentrations of purified and phosphorylated MBP - SirA or purified IHF in a total volume of 20 l of binding buffer .
For MBP - SirA , binding buffer contained 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 ) , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0.5 mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol , and 10 g of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ml 1 .
For IHF , binding buffer contained 40 mM HEPES , 8 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 0.05 % Nonidet P - 40 , and 0.1 mg of BSA ml 1 .
Phosphorylated MBP - SirA was generated by incubation with 100 mM acetyl phosphate ( Sigma ) for 180 min at room temperature , as previously reported ( 11 ) .
Protein - DNA binding reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then electrophoretically separated in 6 % nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 Tris - borate - EDTA buffer at room temperature .
The DNA fragments were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with an Alpha - Imager UV transilluminator ( Alpha Innotech Corp. ) .
primer CBRv - c22 or by using 32 P - labeled primer CsrB - Fw1 and unlabeled primer CBRv - c22 for MBP - SirA and IHF footprinting reactions , respectively .
The 5 = - end - labeled PCR products were purified using a High - Pure PCR product purification kit ( Roche ) .
For the binding reactions , increasing concentrations of phosphorylated MBP - SirA or IHF were incubated at room temperature with 5 10 4 cpm of labeled template in a total of 30 l of the binding buffers used in each case for EMSAs plus 1.0 g of poly ( dI - dC ) ( Boehringer ) .
After 20 min , 0.04 U of DNase I ( Roche ) in dilution buffer ( 10 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 ) was added to the reactions , which were incubated at room temperature for 1 min more and then stopped by the addition of 1 l of 10 mM EDTA .
The final DNA products were purified by phenol and chloroform extractions ; they were then precipitated with isopropanol , washed with 70 % ethanol , dried , and resuspended in 8 l of sequencing stop buffer .
The products were denatured at 85 °C for 5 min and separated by electrophoresis in an 8 % polyacrylamide -- 8 M urea gel , along with a sequencing ladder generated using the same labeled primers and plasmid as the template .
Plasmids pSR660 , expressing the LexA DNAbinding domain ( LexA DBD ) , pSR658 - HNS , expressing the LexA DBD - H - NS fusion , and pSR660 - SirA , expressing the LexA DBD - SirA fusion , were transformed into the E. coli SU101 reporter strain , which carries a chromosomal sulA : : lacZ fusion ( 26 ) .
Transformants were grown in LB - medium supplemented with 1 mM IPTG ( isopropyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ) to induce expression of LexA DBD and hybrid proteins .
Samples collected at an optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of 1.0 were used for the determination of - galactosidase activity as previously described ( 27 ) .
RESULTS Identification of a 9 - bp motif at the regulatory regions of csrB and csrC .
As a first approach to identify cis - acting regulatory sequences required for the coordinated expression of S. Typhimurium csrB and csrC , such as the binding site for SirA , the upstream sequence of these genes were compared using bioinformatics re - January 2014 Volume 196 Number 2 jb.asm.org 327 Martínez et al. .
FIG 1 Computational analyses identified a 9 - bp motif present in the regulatory regions of csrB and csrC .

The dyads are displayed as colored boxes below or above thin lines representing the regulatory region of each gene , showing forward or reverse strands of DNA , respectively .
The positions of the dyads , with respect to the transcriptional start site of each gene , are shown .
The significance of each dyad is proportional to the box height and is indicated by a score .

The base conservation measured in bits is shown as the relative height of each base .
( C ) Feature map of the 9 - bp motif in the regulatory regions of csrB and csrC and their orthologs , obtained by analysis with the matrix scan program using the PSSM shown in panel B .
The 9 - bp motif is shown as blue boxes below or above thin lines representing the regulatory region of each gene , with forward or reverse strands of DNA , respectively .
The position of this motif , with respect to the transcriptional start site of each gene , is indicated .
The box height is proportional to the score obtained for each hit .
BLAST analyses revealed no significant homology between the entire intergenic regions upstream of csrB and csrC ( data not shown ) .
Then , for a more in depth search for motifs in the csrB and csrC regulatory regions , a phylogenetic footprinting analysis was performed .
This analysis is based on the premise that functional regulatory sequences are conserved in orthologous genes , and it has been successfully used to find regulatory motifs in bacteria ( 22 ) .
Therefore , for this analysis we included the upstream sequence of S. Typhimurium csrB and csrC , as well as those of nine orthologous genes from other bacteria ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Several conserved short sequences were found in these upstream regions , most of them overlap ( Fig. 1A ) and thus are part of a 9 - bp motif .
A position - specific scoring matrix ( PSSM ) was constructed for this motif , whose consensus is TGTAAGAGA ( Fig. 1B ) .
Stringent scanning with this PSSM further localized the 9 - bp motif in the regulatory regions of tested csrB , csrC , and rsmB/Y genes ( Fig. 1C ) .
For S. Typhimurium genes , the 9 - bp motif was located four times in the regulatory region of csrB , between positions 190 and 182 , positions 181 and 173 , positions 167 and 159 , and positions 34 and 26 , with respect to its transcriptional start site , and only one well - conserved copy of this motif was located upstream from the promoter of csrC , between positions 168 and 160 , with respect to its transcriptional start site ( Fig. 2 ) .
Interestingly , in csrB , two repetitions of this motif form an 18 - bp inverted - repeated ( IR ) sequence ( TGTGAGAGATCTCTTACA ) , which is located between positions 190 and 173 ( Fig. 2A ) .
The IR sequence is essential for the expression of csrB .
To determine whether the 18 - bp IR sequence is required or whether the single copy of the 9 - bp motif is sufficient for the expression of csrB , a series of csrB transcriptional - fusions to the cat gene were constructed in plasmid pKK232 - 8 , an expression reporter system that we have successfully used in S. Typhimurium ( 11 , 13 ) .
The csrB - cat fusions encompass different lengths of the csrB 5 = upstream regulatory region , as well as a common 3 = end located at position 18 , with respect to the transcriptional start site , and are numbered according to the position of their 5 = end ( Fig. 2A ) .
The CAT specific activity directed by plasmids carrying these csrB - cat fusions was determined in wild - type ( WT ) S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 grown in LB - medium at 37 °C , conditions that favor expression of csrB and csrC ( 9 -- 11 ) .
The csrB - 370 and csrB - 230 fusions , containing the 18 - bp IR sequence and two single nonpalindromic copies of the 9 - bp motif , were expressed at similar levels ( Fig. 3A ) .
In contrast , the expression of the csrB - 170 , csrB - 114 , and csrB - 50 fusions , containing only one or two copies of the 9 - bp motif but lacking the IR sequence , was abolished ( Fig. 3A ) .
These results suggested that the IR sequence is essential for the expression of csrB .
To further define the role of the IR sequence in the expression of csrB , each motif forming the IR sequence ( named R1 and R2 ) 328 jb.asm.org Journal of Bacteriology Regulatory Elements for csrB and csrC FIG 2 Nucleotide sequence of the regulatory regions of csrB ( A ) and csrC ( B ) .
The putative 35 and 10 promoter sequences and the transcriptional start sites ( 1 ) are marked in boldface and underlined .
The 9 - bp motif identified by bioinformatics analyses is shown inside boxes with solid lines .
Horizontal arrows indicate the inverted - repeated ( IR ) sequences formed by two repetitions of the 9 - bp motif , which mediate SirA binding and regulation on csrB and csrC .
For csrC , the less conserved 9 - bp sequence forming the IR sequence is indicated by a horizontal dashed arrow ; the conserved bases in this sequence with respect to the consensus sequence of the 9 - bp motif are shown as capital letters .
For csrB , the predicted IHF binding sequence is shown inside a box with dashed lines , whereas the sequences protected by SirA and IHF in the footprinting assays are indicated by filled and open boxes above the sequence , respectively .
Broken arrows show the 5 = and 3 = ends of the different csrB - cat or csrC - cat fusions .
was modified by site - directed mutagenesis in the csrB - 370 fusion .
The entire sequence of R1 or R2 was replaced by the sequence CACTCACTC , which contains in each position the least conserved nucleotide with respect to the consensus sequence of the 9 - bp motif identified by bioinformatics ( Fig. 1B ) , thus generating the csrB - 370R1 * and csrB - 370R2 * fusions , respectively ( Fig. 3B ) .
The expression of these fusions was drastically reduced in comparison to the expression shown by the WT fusion csrB - 370 ( Fig. 3A ) , indicating that both motifs R1 and R2 forming the IR sequence are required for csrB expression .
As could be expected , the expression of csrB - 370 and csrB - 230 fusions , containing the IR sequence , was drastically reduced in a sirA mutant , with respect to their expression shown in the WT strain ; in addition , the csrB - cat fusions lacking or containing a mutated IR sequence showed background levels of expression in the sirA mutant ( Fig. 3A ) .
In addition , a plasmid expressing SirA was able to restore the expression of the csrB - 370 and csrB - 230 fusions in the sirA mutant ( see Fig .
S1 in the supplemental material ) .
Together , these results show that both the IR sequence and SirA are equally required for the expression of csrB , leading us to hypothesize that the IR sequence is the binding site for SirA .
SirA binds to the IR sequence of csrB .
As a first strategy to determine whether the IR sequence is the binding site for SirA , we analyzed the interaction of phosphorylated MBP - SirA with different segments of the csrB regulatory region , lacking or containing a WT or mutated IR sequence , by nonradioactive competitive EMSAs .
In a previous study , we showed that phosphorylated MBP - SirA specifically binds to the regulatory regions of csrB and csrC at concentrations of 1.5 to 3.0 M ( 11 ) .
The DNA fragments used in the EMSAs were those contained in the corresponding csrB - cat fusions used to evaluate the importance of the IR sequence in csrB expression ( Fig. 3A ) .
In agreement with data from expression analysis , MBP - SirA shifted the fragments containing the WT IR sequence ( csrB - 370 and csrB - 230 ) ( Fig. 3C and D ) , which sustained expression of csrB ( Fig. 3A ) , but did not shift those lacking the IR sequence ( csrB - 170 and csrB - 114 ) ( Fig. 3E and F ) or those containing the mutated R1 or R2 motifs ( csrB - 370R1 * and csrB - 370R2 * , respectively ) ( Fig. 3G and H ) , which did not promote expression of csrB ( Fig. 3A ) .
In all cases , MBP - SirA did not bind to a DNA fragment containing the regulatory region of sigD ( Fig. 3C to H ) , which was used as an internal negative control .
To further confirm that SirA binding to the regulatory region of csrB is mediated by the IR sequence , the interaction of MBP - SirA with the regulatory region of csrB was analyzed by DNase - I-protection assays , performed with a radiolabeled fragment spanning positions 290 to 18 of the csrB regulatory region and increasing amounts of MBP - SirA , in the range of 0.5 to 3 M .
In agreement with the results obtained by EMSAs , MBP - SirA specifically protected the IR sequence ( Fig. 4 ) .
In all , these results demonstrate that SirA specifically binds to the IR sequence located upstream from the csrB promoter .
Our results showed that SirA specifically binds to a sequence with dyad symmetry on the regulatory region of csrB , suggesting that SirA needs to dimerize for DNA binding .
Hence , we evaluated the potential interaction between SirA monomers by using the bacterial LexA - based genetic system for homodimerization assays ( 26 , 28 ) .
In this system , the LexA DNA - January 2014 Volume 196 Number 2 jb.asm.org 329 Martínez et al. .
FIG 3 SirA regulates csrB by binding to the IR sequence .
( A ) Expression of the csrB - 370 , csrB - 230 , csrB - 170 , csrB - 114 , csrB - 50 , csrB - 370R1 * , and csrB - 370R2 * transcriptional - fusions contained in plasmids pcsrB - 370 , pcsrB - 230 , pcsrB - 170 , pcsrB - 114 , pcsrB - 50 , pcsrB - 370R1 * , and pcsrB - 370R2 * , respectively , was tested in the WT S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 and its isogenic sirA mutant .
CAT - specific activity was determined from samples collected of bacterial cultures grown for5hinLBmedium at 37 °C .
The data are the averages of three independent experiments performed in duplicate .

WT sequences of R1 and R2 are indicated by horizontal arrows , and mutations introduced in R1 or R2 are indicated by italic letters .
Transcriptional fusions containing WT sequences of R1 and R2 ( csrB - 370 ) or carrying the mutation of R1 or R2 ( csrB - 370R1 * and csrB - 370R2 * , respectively ) are indicated .
SirA binding to DNA fragments contained in the csrB - 370 ( C ) , csrB - 230 ( D ) , csrB - 170 ( E ) , csrB - 114 ( F ) , csrB - 370R1 * ( G ) , and csrB - 370R2 * ( H ) fusions was analyzed by competitive nonradioactive EMSAs .
PCR - amplified and purified fragments csrB - 370 , csrB - 230 , csrB - 170 , csrB - 114 , csrB - 370R1 * , and csrB - 370R2 * were incubated with increasing concentrations ( 0 to 3 M ) of purified and phosphorylated MBP - SirA fusion protein .
As a negative control , a fragment containing the regulatory region of sigD was included in each DNA - binding reaction .
The DNA - protein complexes ( indicated by an asterisk ) were resolved in a nondenaturing 6 % polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide .
binding domain ( LexA DBD ) expressed from a plasmid is used as a reporter to determine protein dimerization .
Alone , the LexA DBD is not functional ; however , when it is fused to a protein that interacts itself , a dimeric form of LexA DBD is generated , which is able to repress the expression of sulA gene belonging to the LexA regulon ( 26 , 28 ) .
Plasmid pSR660 - SirA ( Table 1 ) was introduced into the E. coli SU101 reporter strain , which carries a chromosomal sulAlacZ fusion , to test the dimerization capacity of a LexA DBD - SirA fusion protein .
Plasmid pSR660 , expressing LexA DBD , and plasmid pSR658 - HNS , expressing LexA DBD - H - NS fusion protein whose dimerization capacity has been tested in this system before ( 29 ) , were used as negative and positive controls , respectively .
Both LexA DBD - H - NS and LexA DBD - SirA , but not LexA DBD , repressed the expression of the sulA - lacZ fusion ( Fig. 5 ) , indicating that SirA dimerizes .
SirA regulates csrC expression both directly and indirectly .
SirA regulates csrC directly ( 11 ) ; however , according to our bioinformatics analyses , only one copy of the 9 - bp motif is present in the regulatory region of csrC ( Fig. 2B ) .
A more detailed manual sequence analysis of the vicinity of this motif revealed a sequence , located in the reverse strand immediately downstream to the 9 - bp motif , matching 4 of 9 positions of the consensus of this motif ( Fig. 1B and 2B ) , thus forming an imperfect 18 - bp palindromic sequence ( TGTGAGACATTGACCATT ) .
In order to determine whether this less - conserved IR sequence , or only the single 9 - bp motif , is required for expression of csrC , each motif ( named R1 and R2 ) was modified in the csrC - 350 fusion , as described above for csrB , generating the csrC - 350R1 * and csrC - 350R2 * fusions ( Fig. 6A ) .
In the WT S. Typhimurium strain , the expression of both mutated fusions csrC - 350R1 * and csrC - 350R2 * was reduced 3 - fold with respect to the expression of the WT fusion csrC - 350 ( Fig. 6B ) , indicating that both motifs R1 and R2 forming this imperfect IR sequence are necessary for full csrC expression .
As expected , the expression of the WT csrC - 350 fusion was reduced in the sirA mutant ( Fig. 6B ) .
Surprisingly , the expression levels of the mutated fusions csrC - 350R1 * and csrC - 350R2 * , which lack a functional IR sequence , were further reduced 3 - fold in the sirA mutant with respect to those observed in the WT strain ( Fig. 6B ) .
A plasmid expressing SirA was able to restore the expression of csrC - 350 , csrC - 350R1 * , and csrC - 350R2 * fusions in the sirA mutant to their respective levels shown in the WT strain ( see Fig .
S1 in the supplemental material ) .

FIG 4 DNase I footprinting of the csrB regulatory region by SirA .
A 32 P - endlabeled DNA fragment corresponding to positions 290 to 18 of csrB was mixed and incubated with different concentrations of purified and phosphorylated MBP - SirA protein and then treated with DNase I .
The reactions were analyzed on a polyacrylamide - urea gel in parallel with sequencing reactions ( indicated by GATC ) , which were generated with the same template .
The black triangle above the gel represents increasing amounts ( 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , and 3 M ) of MBP - SirA .
Reactions without DNase I treatment and reaction treated with DNase I but lacking MBP - SirA are indicated by `` -- '' and `` '' , respectively .
The protected region is indicated by a vertical black bar , and the protected sequence is enlarged .
Vertical arrows indicate the IR sequence .
The images for the DNase I reactions and for the sequencing ladder were obtained by two different exposures of the same film .
To further explore these observations , csrC - 239 and csrC - 119 fusions were constructed , with or without the imperfect IR sequence , respectively ( Fig. 2B ) , and their expression was determined in the WT strain and the sirA mutant .
The expression of csrC - 239 fusion was almost identical to that observed with csrC - 350 fusion in the WT strain and showed the same 8.5 - fold reduction in the sirA mutant ( Fig. 6B ) .
In contrast , the expression pattern of the csrC - 119 fusion was very similar to that of the mutated fusions csrC - 350R1 * and csrC - 350R2 * , showing an 3 - fold reduction in the WT strain with respect to the csrC - 350 fusion and a further reduction in the sirA mutant with respect to its expression levels in the WT strain ( Fig. 6B ) .
Interestingly , these results indicate that SirA - mediated regulation of csrC still occurs in the absence of the imperfect IR sequence .
To determine whether this IR sequence is required for SirA binding and whether there is more than one SirA binding site in the regulatory region of csrC , EMSAs were performed with the different fragments contained in the csrC - cat fusions described above .
As could be expected , MBP - SirA bound to the csrC - 350 and csrC - 239 fragments ( Fig. 6C and F ) .
However , it did not bind to the csrC - 350R1 * , csrC - 350R2 * , and csrC - 119 fragments ( Fig. 6D , E , and G ) , indicating that SirA specifically binds to the imperfect IR sequence located in the regulatory region of csrC , between positions 168 and 151 ( Fig. 2B ) , and that no additional SirA binding sites are present in the csrC regulatory region .
Together , these results show that SirA regulates csrC expression directly , by binding to the imperfect IR sequence , but also through an indirect mechanism that is independent of this IR sequence and of SirA binding to the regulatory region of this gene .
SirA indirectly regulates csrC expression through the Csr system .
The csrC - cat fusions used in the assays described above contain fragments of the regulatory region of csrC with a common 3 = end located at position 63 ( Fig. 2B ; Table 1 ) .
Thus , the transcripts generated from these fusions carry a 5 = end of CsrC that contains three CsrA binding sites .
In contrast , the transcripts generated from the tested csrB - cat fusions carry a 5 = end of CsrB containing only one CsrA binding site ( Fig. 2A and Table 1 ) .
Therefore , the indirect SirA - mediated regulation of csrC revealed from our results , could be due to a direct negative effect exerted by CsrA on the expression of the csrC - cat fusions , which could be counteracted by SirA through CsrB/CsrC .
To investigate this , we constructed and analyzed the expression of the csrC - 350 3 , csrC - 350R1 * 3 , and csrC - cat - 119 3 fusions , which are derivatives of the csrC - 350 , csrC - 350R1 * , and csrC - cat - 119 fusions , respectively , that lack the csrC region between positions 4 and 63 ( Fig. 2B , Table 1 ) .
The expression pattern shown by the csrC - 350 3 , csrC - 350R1 * 3 , and csrC - cat - 119 3 fusions in the WT S. Typhimurium strain and its isogenic sirA mutant resembled that shown by their respective parental fusions , csrC - 350 , csrC - 350R1 * , or csrC - cat - 119 ( Fig. 3 , 6 , and 7 ) , indicating that the 5 = of CsrC is not involved in the indirect SirA - mediated regulation of csrC .
Thus , indirect SirA - mediated regulation of csrC must involve an intermediate regulatory element whose expression is directly controlled by SirA .
Our first candidates were in fact the CsrB and CsrC sRNAs , since according to current knowledge they seem to be responsible for the entire SirA - mediated regulatory response .
In order to test whether SirA indirectly regulates csrC expression through CsrB or CsrC , we analyzed the expression of the csrC - 350R1 * 3 and csrC - 119 3 fusions , which are only indirectly regulated by SirA , and the csrC - 350 3 fusion , whose expression is expected to be controlled by SirA both directly and indirectly , in the sirA mutant containing the vector pMPM - K3 or plasmid pK3 - CsrB1 that constitutively expresses CsrB .
In a previous study we showed that plasmid pK3 - CsrB1 is able to restore the expression of SPI - 1 genes in the sirA mutant , indicating that SirA regulates these genes through CsrB and CsrC ( 11 ) .

PCR - amplified and purified fragments csrC - 350 , csrC - 350R1 * , csrC - 350R2 * , csrC - 239 , and csrC - 119 were incubated with increasing concentrations ( 0 to 3 M ) of purified and phosphorylated MBP - SirA fusion protein .
As a negative control , a fragment containing the regulatory region of sigD was included in each DNA - binding reaction .
The DNA - protein complexes ( indicated by an asterisk ) were resolved in a nondenaturing 6 % polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide .
plasmid pK3 - CsrB1 in the sirA mutant , restored the expression of csrC - 350R1 * 3 and csrC - 119 3 fusions to the levels shown in the WT strain and increased the expression of the csrC - 350 3 fusion , but only to levels similar to those reached by the csrC - 350R1 * 3 and csrC - 119 3 fusions ( Fig. 7 ) .
Furthermore , the expression of these csrC - cat fusions was also restored in a sirA csrA : : kan double mutant to levels similar to those reached in the sirA mutant containing pK3 - CsrB ( Fig. 7 ) .
In contrast , the background levels of expression shown by the csrB - 370 and csrB - 370 2 fusions ( Table 1 ) inthe sirA mutant were not affected by the presence of pK3 - CsrB or the absence of CsrA ( Fig .
S2 in the supplemental material and data not shown ) .
Together , these results demonstrate that indirect SirA - mediated regulation of csrC acts through the Csr system , which reveals a positive autoregulatory loop for the expression of csrC .
In addition , these results further support that SirA does not indirectly regulate csrB .
IHF directly regulates the expression of csrB .
To search for other possible regulatory sequences required for the expression of csrB and csrC , the regulatory regions of these genes were stringently scanned with the 86 high - quality PSSMs for binding sites of E. coli transcriptional factors from the RegulonDB database version 8.0 ( 23 ) .
Only one putative binding site for the IHF and one for the response regulator CpxR were identified in csrB ; both were located between the IR sequence bound by SirA and the promoter ( Fig. 2A and data not shown ) , whereas none was identified in csrC .

The predicted IHF and CpxR binding sites in csrB have a weight score ( a value indicating the significance of the prediction ) of 9.8 and 7.9 , respectively ; these values are within the range of weight scores , 5 to 10 , that have been generated for known binding sites of each IHF and CpxR and are annotated in the RegulonDB database ( 23 ) .
Therefore , these computational analyses strongly suggested that IHF and CpxR could be involved in the expression of csrB but not of csrC .
To investigate this , the expression of the csrB - 370 and csrC - 350 fusions was analyzed in S. Typhimurium mutant strains lacking IHF or CpxR , which were grown in LB - medium at 37 °C .
The expression of both fusions was not affected by the absence of CpxR or of its cognate sensor kinase CpxA ( data not shown ) , indicating that the two - component system CpxA/R is not involved in the expression of csrB and csrC under the growth - conditions tested .
In contrast , the expression of the csrB - 370 fusion , but not of the csrC - 350 fusion , was drastically reduced in the himA mutant lacking the subunit of IHF ( Fig. 8A ) .
As expected , a plasmid expressing IHF restored the expression of csrB - 370 fusion in the himA mutant ( see Fig .
S3 in the supplemental material ) .
Thus , in agreement with the prediction of the IHF binding site in csrB but not in csrC , these results indicate that IHF is required for the expression of csrB but not of csrC .

January 2014 Volume 196 Number 2 jb.asm.org 333 Martínez et al. tion of purified IHF with the regulatory region of csrB was evaluated by nonradioactive competitive EMSAs .
As shown in Fig. 8B , IHF shifted the fragment containing the regulatory region of csrB , from a concentration of 40 nM , but even at higher concentrations IHF did not shift the fragment containing the regulatory region of sigD , which was used as an internal negative control .
These results showed that IHF specifically binds to the regulatory region of csrB .
To determine the specific sequence bound by IHF , DNase - I-protection assays were performed using purified IHF and a radiolabeled fragment spanning positions 290 to 18 of the csrB regulatory region .
IHF protected the sequence located between positions 116 to 86 , which includes the sequence ( AACAACT AATTA ) initially predicted by the bioinformatics analyses as a possible IHF binding site ( Fig. 2A and 8C ) .
Therefore , these results demonstrate that IHF positively controls the expression of csrB by binding to a site located between the SirA binding sequence and the promoter .
DISCUSSION In this study , by computational analysis we identified a 9 - bp motif ( TGTAAGAGA ) present in the regulatory regions of S. Typhimurium csrB and csrC genes ( Fig. 1B ) .
In csrB , two copies of this motif form an 18 - bp IR sequence ( TGTGAGAGATCTCTTACA ) , which is located upstream from the promoter , between positions 190 and 173 ( Fig. 2A ) .
We determined that the presence of this IR sequence is required for expression of csrB and for SirA binding to the regulatory region of this gene ( Fig. 3 and 4 ) .
Moreover , we demonstrated that each 9 - bp motif forming this IR sequence is essential for the expression of csrB and for SirA binding to csrB ( Fig. 3 ) .
We also provided evidence that SirA dimerizes ( Fig. 5 ) , which is consistent with its capacity to bind a sequence with dyad symmetry .
NarL , which belongs to the same family of response regulators , is also known to act as a dimer ( 30 ) .
In addition , we also identified a similar 18 - bp IR sequence located upstream from the promoter of csrC ( TGTGAGACATTGACCATT ) , between positions 168 and 151 ( Fig. 2B ) , which is required for direct SirA - mediated regulation of csrC ( Fig. 6 ) .
Interestingly , whereas the 18 - bp IR sequence of csrB is formed by two well - conserved copies of the 9 - bp motif , the 18 - bp IR sequence of csrC is formed by a well - conserved copy of this motif and a second one less conserved ( matching 4 of 9 positions of the consensus sequence of the 9 - bp motif ) ( Fig. 1 and 2 ) , which are equally required for expression of csrC and for SirA binding to csrC ( Fig. 6 ) .
MBP - SirA bound at similar concentrations ( 1.5 to 3.0 M ) to the different DNA fragments containing the 18 - bp IR sequence of either csrB or csrC ( Fig. 3 and 6 ) , which suggests that the variations in the IR sequence of csrC do not significantly affect the DNA binding affinity of SirA .
Together , these results demonstrate that this IR sequence is the SirA binding site on the S. Typhimurium csrB and csrC genes .
A similar IR sequence has been found upstream from the promoters of csrB and csrC and of rsmB , rsmX , rsmY , and rsmZ genes from different gammaproteobacteria , which are regulated by BarA/SirA orthologous ( 31 -- 40 ) .
Moreover , a computational sequence analysis , including a wide number of characterized and predicted csrB , csrC , rsmB , rsmX , rsmY , and rsmZ genes revealed some differences between the IR sequences of csrB ( TGTGAGAG ATCTCTTACA ) , csrC ( TGTGAGNCATNGNCCATN ) , and rsmX , rsmY , and rsmZ ( TGTAAGNNATNGCTTACA ) genes ( 36 ) .
Interestingly , the same differences that we found between the IR sequences of csrB and csrC of S. Typhimurium , have been shown between all of the csrB and csrC orthologous genes analyzed in a previous study ( 36 ) , an observation that supports our findings indicating that SirA regulates csrC by binding to an imperfect IR sequence .
Experimental evidence for the regulatory role of this IR sequence had been obtained only for rsmY and rsmZ genes of Pseudomonas spp. and Legionella pneumophila ( 31 , 37 -- 39 , 41 ) .
Thus , our results provide evidence supporting the role of this IR sequence as the binding site of SirA and its orthologous on csrB and csrC genes .
Interestingly , our findings revealed that partial regulation of SirA on csrC is sustained in the absence of the IR sequence , which does not involve SirA binding to any other sequence of the regulatory region of csrC ( Fig. 6 ) .
Moreover , our results indicate that SirA indirectly regulates csrC , but not csrB , in a cascade fashion , through the Csr system ( Fig. 7 and see Fig .
S2 in the supplemental material ) .
Our results suggest that SirA counteracts , through CsrB/CsrC , a negative control exerted by CsrA on the expression of a factor that in turn regulates csrC .
fluorescens , PsrA , a member of the TetR/AcrR family of transcriptional regulators , which directly activates the expression of the stationary - phase sigma factor RpoS ( 42 ) , is required for the expression of rsmZ ( 38 ) .
Intriguingly , the expression of psrA is positively regulated by the GacS/GacA system in P. chlororaphis ( 43 ) but not in P. fluorescens ( 38 ) .
To determine the remaining factor ( s ) involved in the indirect SirA - mediated regulation of csrC is a matter of our current and future studies .
We determined that the integration host factor ( IHF ) positively regulates the expression of csrB , but not of csrC , and demonstrated that IHF binds the sequence that we initially predicted by computational analyses as an IHF binding site ( Fig. 8 ) , which is located between the SirA binding site and the promoter of csrB ( Fig. 2A ) .
In vitro binding of IHF to the regulatory region of P. fluorescens rsmZ was demonstrated in a previous study ( 38 ) , suggesting that IHF could also be involved in the expression of this gene .
IHF is a nucleoid - associated protein that binds and bends the DNA at specific sequences and thus acts as an accessory factor in a wide variety of processes , including transcription ( 44 ) .
In S. Typhimurium csrB and csrC genes , the IR sequence bound by SirA is centered at positions 181.5 and 159.5 , respectively ( Fig. 2 ) , whereas in csrB and csrC orthologs and in rsmZ genes the IR sequence is centered at around positions 159.5 , 168.5 , 182.5 , or 217.5 ( 31 -- 34 , 37 , 38 , 40 , 41 ) .
Since the flexibility of the subunits of RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) can only expand up to position 100 , an activator bound to a site located upstream to this position requires the formation of a loop in the intervening sequence to contact RNAP bound to the promoter ( 45 , 46 ) .
The DNA - bending protein IHF usually generates this loop , by binding to a site located between the activator binding sequence and the promoter ; however , this loop can also be generated by other DNAbending proteins , such as HU , or by intrinsically curved DNA ( 45 , 47 -- 50 ) .
Whether IHF induces a DNA bending that facilitates the formation of SirA/RNAP/promoter complex in csrB and whether another DNA - bending protein , such as HU or intrinsically curved DNA , is involved in the expression of csrC remains to be determined .
The insight from the present study contributes to the better understanding of the SirA - mediated regulatory mechanism controlling the expression of CsrB and CsrC sRNAs , which regulate 334 jb.asm.org Journal of Bacteriology Regulatory Elements for csrB and csrC the expression of numerous genes encoding a wide variety of cellular functions .
