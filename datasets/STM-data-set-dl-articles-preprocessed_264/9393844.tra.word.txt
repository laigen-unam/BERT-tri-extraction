FANG , * ANDRÉS VAZQUEZ - TORRES , AND YISHENG XU Departments of Medicine , Pathology , and Microbiology , University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , Denver , Colorado 80262 In Escherichia coli , the SoxRS regulon is required for resistance to redox - cycling agents which elevate cytosolic superoxide levels , as well as for resistance to nitric - oxide - dependent macrophage killing .
In Salmonella typhimurium , SoxS is also required for enhanced expression of Mn - superoxide dismutase and resistance to paraquat , but not for resistance to nitric - oxide donor compounds in - vitro , resistance to macrophage killing , or virulence in mice .
Differences in other antioxidant defense systems or compensation by homologous regulons may account for species - specific differences in the role of SoxS .
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , Mail code B - 168 , Denver , CO 80262 .
A number of stress regulons which defend bacteria from oxidative injury have been identified .
The divergently transcribed soxR and soxS genes encode components of an unusual two - component regulatory system which was first recognized to activate expression of more than 10 Escherichia coli genes in response to redox - cycling agents ( e.g. , paraquat ) , which generate elevated levels of superoxide ( O 2 ) within the bacterial cytosol ( 56 , 58 ) .
Generation of extracellular O 2 by xanthine oxidase - hypoxanthine does not induce the expression of SoxRS - regulated genes ( 49 ) .
However , induction of the SoxRS regulon is not specific for cytosolic O 2 ; dissolved nitric - oxide ( NO ) gas , NO - producing macrophages , hypochlorous acid , copper sulfate , or diamide can also induce SoxRS - dependent gene activation ( 15 , 19 , 37 , 41 , 48 ) .
Each SoxR monomer contains a [ 2Fe - 2S ] cluster which is required for functional activity but not for DNA binding at the soxS promoter region ( 17 , 32 ) .
One - electron oxidation of the FeS center allows SoxR to activate transcription of the soxS gene ( 25 ) .
The SoxS protein in turn interacts with 70 - RNA polymerase to promote transcription of multiple genes , including zwf ( glucose - 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ) , sodA ( manganese - cofactored superoxide dismutase [ SOD ] ) , micF ( antisense RNA for ompF mRNA ) , acrAB ( inner membrane efflux pump ) , nfo ( endonuclease IV ) , rimK ( modifies ribosomal protein S6 ) , fumC ( oxidation - resistant fumarase ) , acnA ( aconitase ) , ribA ( GTP cyclohydrolase II ) , and fpr ( ferredoxin - NADPH oxidoreductase ) ( 9 , 28 , 29 , 38 , 41 , 42 , 56 , 58 , 59 ) .
Expression of SoxS alone can activate genes in the absence of SoxR or inducing agents such as paraquat ( 1 ) .
The SoxR protein is homologous to the MerR family of transcriptional activators ( 1 ) , while the SoxS protein has significant homology to the C - terminal DNA - binding region of the AraC family of transcriptional regulatory proteins ( 52 ) .
A subset of this family includes SoxS , MarA , Rob , TetD , and RamA from Klebsiella pneumoniae ; PqrA from Proteus vulgaris ; and AarP from Providencia stuartii ( 2 , 10 , 24 , 26 , 27 , 33 , 43 , 54 ) .
These proteins have 37 to 52 % amino - acid identity with SoxS and , interestingly , appear to share some functional overlap as well .
Overexpression of MarA , Rob , RamA , PqrA , or AarP results in the activation of at least some , though not all , SoxRSregulated genes ( 2 , 26 , 33 -- 35 , 40 , 43 -- 45 , 50 ) .
However , divergent environmental signals appear to induce expression of these homologous systems ; for example , marA gene expression is induced by weak - acids such as salicylate ( 11 ) , while rob expression appears to be growth phase regulated ( 36 ) .
E. coli strains carrying null mutations in soxR or soxS are hypersusceptible to redox - cycling agents ( 59 ) .
Of greater potential biological significance was an E. coli soxRS mutant which was found to have a survival rate reduced by approximately fivefold in peptone - elicited peritoneal macrophages from CD1 mice ( 49 ) .
E. coli strains carrying mutations in SoxRS - regulated genes nfo , micF , sodA , and zwf were also observed to have decreased resistance to macrophage killing ( 48 , 49 ) .
In related experiments , the hypersusceptibility of soxS mutant E. coli to macrophage killing was partially abrogated by the addition of N G - monomethyl - L-arginine , an inhibitor of inducible NO synthase ( 48 ) , suggesting that the SoxRS regulon functions to counteract NO - dependent antimicrobial systems of phagocytic cells .
Other phenotypes associated with soxRS include resistance to multiple antimicrobial - agents , tolerance to organic solvents , and resistance to heavy metals ( 3 , 9 , 44 , 47 ) .
Unlike E. coli , Salmonella species are intracellular pathogens with specific adaptations favoring survival within host macrophages ( 22 , 23 ) .
Observations of experimental animals or of humans indicate that oxygen - dependent antimicrobial systems are important in host defense against Salmonella infection ( 7 , 14 , 46 ) .
Therefore , it has been suggested that the SoxRS regulon plays an important role in Salmonella virulence by mediating resistance to reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates produced by phagocytic cells ( 48 ) .
In the present study , we constructed a Salmonella typhimurium strain carrying a soxS mutation in order to assess the role of the SoxRS regulon in the resistance of Salmonella to oxidative and nitrosative stress in - vitro , survival in phagocytic cells , and virulence in mice .
Primers 5 - ATCAAACTGCCGACGGAAAACGCGGGA GAA - 3 and 5 - TGACCAGCCGCTTAACATTGATGTAGT CGC - 3 were devised from the sequence of the E. coli soxS gene and used to amplify an internal 238 - bp soxS fragment from S. typhimurium ATCC 14028s genomic DNA by reducedstringency PCR ( 50 °C ) .
This fragment was ligated into the EcoRV site of pBLUESCRIPT ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif. ) in E. coli DH5 ( 30 ) and sequenced .
Genetic manipulations and DNA sequence determination were performed by conven - 5371 5372 NOTES INFECT .
Paraquat - inducible SOD activity of soxS mutant and wild - type ( WT ) S. typhimurium strains .
Equivalent quantities of cell extracts from soxS mutant or wild - type S. typhimurium strains were electrophoresed through a 7 % acrylamide nondenaturing gel and stained for visualization of SOD activity .
The locations of Fe - cofactored ( SodB ) and Mn - cofactored ( SodA ) SODs are indicated .
A 250 M concentration of paraquat ( P ) was used to induce the SoxRS regulon which controls sodA expression .
Inducibility of sodA expression by paraquat is abrogated in the soxS mutant , but basal sodA expression is unchanged .
Susceptibility of soxS mutant and wild - type ( WT ) S. typhimurium strains to reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates in - vitro .
Susceptibility was determined by a disk diffusion method ( 4 , 13 ) .
Zone diameter ( standard deviation of the mean ) is a measure of susceptibility .
soxS mutant S. typhimurium has enhanced susceptibility to paraquat but not to S - nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO ) , SIN - 1 , H 2 O 2 , or DETA/NO .
DETA/NO failed to demonstrate detectable inhibition of either strain .
The cloned fragment was determined to be 81 % identical to the corresponding region of the E. coli soxS gene .
Subsequently , the entire sequence of the S. typhimurium soxS gene was deposited in GenBank ( U61147 ) by other investigators and confirmed to correspond precisely with the cloned fragment .
The E. coli and S. typhimurium predicted SoxS proteins are highly related , with 95 % identity at the amino - acid level .
The internal S. typhimurium soxS fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of suicide vector pRR10 ( trfA ) ( 21 ) in E. coli S17 - 1 ( 55 ) and conjugated into S. typhimurium 14028s to create a soxS gene interruption linked to a - lactam resistance marker .
Integration of the suicide vector results in the deletion of the last 30 nucleotides of soxS gene , which were previously shown in E. coli to be essential for production of a functional SoxS protein ( 58 ) .
The E. coli donor strain was counterselected in M9 - minimal - medium ( 51 ) with 250 g of penicillin ( Sigma , St. Louis , Mo. ) per ml , and S. typhimurium exconjugants on xylose - lysine - deoxycholate agar ( Difco , Detroit , Mich. ) were identified .
Interruption of the soxS gene was confirmed by Southern blotting of genomic DNA ( not shown ) with the 32 P - labelled soxS internal fragment as a probe .
Expression of the SoxRS regulon was induced by treatment of 2 10 8 bacteria in 5 ml of Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth with 250 M paraquat ( Sigma ) for 4 h. Cells were subsequently lysed and analyzed by SOD activity gel electrophoresis ( 5 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
Bacteria were lysed by freeze - thawing with or without4hof pretreatment with 250 M paraquat ( Sigma ) .
Extracts were separated by electrophoresis through a 7 % acrylamide nondenaturing gel .
The gel was stained with nitroblue tetrazolium in the presence of photoactivated riboflavin , revealing SOD activity as a negative image .
Marked augmentation of Mn - SOD activity was seen in the wild type , but not in the soxS mutant S. typhimurium strain treated with paraquat .
Susceptibility to oxidant and NO - donor compounds was determined by disk diffusion assaying as described previously ( 4 , 13 ) .
Paper disks ( diameter , 1/4 in .
) were placed over a lawn of 10 6 bacteria .
A 15 - l volume of paraquat ( 1.9 % ; Sigma ) , S - nitrosoglutathione ( 500 mM ; prepared as described previously [ 13 ] ) , 3 - morpholinosydnonimine ( SIN - 1 ; 500 mM ; Sigma ) , hydrogen peroxide ( 3 % ; Sigma ) , or diethylenetriamine - NO adduct ( 500 mM DETA/NO ; Research Biochemists International , Natick , Mass. ) was applied to the disks as indicated elsewhere ( 13 ) .
Zones of inhibition were measured after overnight incubation at 37 °C ; the zone of inhibition is a measure of bacterial susceptibility .
Each susceptibility experiment was performed at least twice .
S. typhimurium carrying a soxS mutation was found to be hypersusceptible to paraquat ( 1.9 % ) compared with the wild type ( Fig. 2 ) , but not to S - nitrosoglutathione ( 500 mM ) , SIN - 1 ( 500 mM ) , hydrogen - peroxide ( 3 % ) , or DETA/NO ( 500 mM ) .
Susceptibility to several conventional antimicrobial - agents was also determined by a disk diffusion method ( 4 ) .
Mueller - Hinton agar ( BBL , Cockeysville , Md. ) was used for antimicrobial agent susceptibility testing .
Commercially prepared disks ( BBL ) impregnated with - tetracycline ( 30 g ) , ofloxacin ( 5 g ) , trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole ( 1.25 / 23.75 g ) , or gentamicin ( 10 g ) were used as indicated elsewhere ( 4 ) .
Wild - type S. typhimurium and soxS mutant S. typhimurium did not differ in their susceptibilities to tetracycline , ofloxacin , trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole , or gentamicin ( data not shown ) .
Thus , basal levels of resistance to multiple antimicrobial - agents do not appear to be dependent on SoxRS , in contrast to observations regarding the role of MarA in E. coli .
Relative survival of soxS mutant or wild - type S. typhimurium in both J774 .1 macrophage - like cells and gamma interferon ( IFN - ) - stimulated resident peritoneal macrophages ( Fig. 3 ) from C57/BL6 mice was determined essentially as described by Buchmeier and Heffron ( 8 ) .
J774 .1 cells or resident peritoneal macrophages from C57/BL6 mice ( 57 ) were cultivated in RPMI with 10 % horse serum , plated to a density of 5 10 5 / ml , and allowed to adhere for 4 h. IFN - ( 200 U/ml ) was added to the resident peritoneal macrophages for 18 h. Bacteria were opsonized in normal mouse serum and spun onto macrophages at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 .
After 15 min of incubation , gentamicin ( 6 g/ml ) was added to kill extracellular organisms .
At specified time intervals , the macrophages were lysed in 0.5 % deoxycholate and the bacteria were dilutionally plated onto LB agar for quantitation of CFU .
Nitrite production was assayed by the Griess reaction ( 18 ) .
Each of these experiments was performed at least twice .
No significant effect of the soxS mutation on survival in either J774 .1 or peritoneal cells was evident .
NO production by the peritoneal macrophages was confirmed by measurement of its end oxidation VOL .

No significant effect of the soxS mutation on the ability of Salmonella to survive in macrophages was detected .

The mortality of Ity genetically susceptible ( BALB/c and C57BL/6J ) or Ity r genetically resistant ( C3H/HeN ) mice was determined after intraperitoneal administration of wild - type or soxS mutant S. typhimurium to 6 - to 8 - week - old female BALB/c , C57BL/6J , or C3H/HeN mice ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , Maine ) .
The intraperitoneal 50 % lethal dose ( LD 50 ) for wild - type S. typhimurium in BALB/c mice is 10 organisms ( 22 ) .
Therefore , an intraperitoneal inoculum of 10 3 organisms is routinely employed to detect significant attenuation of Salmonella virulence ( 22 ) in susceptible strains of mice .
No significant effects of the soxS mutation on virulence were seen in any mouse model ( Table 1 ) , although a subtle effect on virulence can not be excluded by these experiments .
Mice challenged with soxS mutant S. typhimurium were necropsied to confirm the stability of the soxS insertion mutation in - vivo ; 100 % of 100 individual bacterial colonies recovered from each mouse spleen were found to retain the - lactamase marker after being picked onto selective medium .
Sequence analysis indicates that the transcriptional regulator SoxS has been highly conserved in E. coli and S. typhimurium .
Elegant prior studies with E. coli have demonstrated that oxidative - stresses which result in one - electron oxidation of the essential SoxS [ 2Fe - 2S ] cluster can activate the SoxS protein ( 17 , 25 ) and ultimately result in the enhanced expression of more than 10 SoxS - activated genes which help to resist or repair oxidative cell damage .
In this work , we report the mutagenesis and functional characterization of soxS in S. typhimurium .
As demonstrated in E. coli ( 56 ) , SoxS is required in S. typhimurium for paraquat - induced augmentation of Mn - SOD expression and resistance to the antimicrobial activity of paraquat .
However , despite earlier experiments with E. coli suggesting that the SoxRS regulon might allow bacteria to resist NOrelated antimicrobial systems of phagocytic cells ( 48 ) , soxS mutant S. typhimurium does not have enhanced susceptibility to NO - donor compounds , enhanced susceptibility to killing by a Mortality in BALB/c , C57BL/6J , or C3H/HeN mice following intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) inoculation with wild - type ( WT ) or mutant S. typhimurium was determined .
The intraperitoneal S. typhimurium LD 50 for BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice is 10 organisms ( 22 ) , and the LD 50 for C3H/HeN mice is 1 10 3 to 2 10 3 organisms ( 14 ) .
The soxS gene is not essential for Salmonella virulence in mice .
b PBS , phosphate - buffered saline .
NO - producing macrophages , or reduced virulence in mice , including both innately Salmonella - susceptible and - resistant mouse strains .
These findings are somewhat unexpected , because several clinical and experimental observations have indicated that both the respiratory burst and NO production by phagocytic cells play important roles in host defense against Salmonella infection ( 7 , 14 , 46 ) .
The specific reactive oxygen and nitrogen species responsible for microbial stasis or killing in - vivo have not yet been precisely defined ( 20 ) .
Redox - cycling agents such as paraquat can induce expression of the SoxRS regulon by elevating cytosolic superoxide levels in - vitro but are unlikely to represent a physiologic stimulus relevant to phagocyte - pathogen interactions , since the inner membranes of gram - negative bacteria do not appear to be permeable to superoxide anion ( 49 , 53 ) .
Although NO radical ( NO ) can penetrate membranes readily ( 16 ) , it does not appear to be cytotoxic for E. coli or Salmonella , in contrast to other NO congeners ( 6 , 13 ) .
Therefore , it is possible that the oxidants resisted by the SoxRS regulon are not the same reactants encountered by bacteria during phagocyte - pathogen interactions .
Alternatively , it is conceivable that the SoxRS regulon is nonessential for Salmonella virulence because of the presence of other antioxidant defenses .
Salmonella is highly adapted to survival within macrophages ( 22 , 23 ) and may have evolved additional systems capable of supplanting the role of SoxRS .
Several SoxRS - activated genes are already known to be under the influence of other regulatory networks ( e.g. , fur , S , arcA , IHF , and fnr ) ( 12 , 31 , 39 ) .
Moreover , the complex interrelationships between SoxS and its homologs ( e.g. , MarR and Rob ) have yet to be fully defined .
Compensation for the loss of SoxS by a related transcriptional activator responding to a different environmental signal may account for the dispensability of SoxS for Salmonella virulence and survival in phagocytes .
Additional important genetic regulatory systems controlling Salmonella resistance to oxygen - dependent antimicrobial systems remain to be elucidated .
