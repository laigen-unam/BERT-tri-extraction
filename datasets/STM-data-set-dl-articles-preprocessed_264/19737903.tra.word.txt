Bourret , † Miryoung Song , and Andrés Vázquez - Torres * Department of Microbiology , University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine , Aurora , Colorado Here we show that the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium PhoQ sensor kinase lessens the cytotoxicity of reactive - nitrogen - species ( RNS ) generated by inducible nitric - oxide synthase ( iNOS ) in the innate response of mononuclear phagocytic cells .
This observation is consistent with the expression patterns of PhoP - activated genes during moderate nitrosative - stress in the innate host response .
In contrast , RNS synthesized during high - NO fluxes of gamma interferon ( IFN - ) - activated macrophages repress PhoP - activated lpxO , pagP , and phoP gene transcription .
Because PhoP - regulated Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) genes are also repressed by high - order RNS ( 39 ) , we investigated whether the NO - mediated inhibition of PhoPQ underlies the repression of SPI2 .
Our studies indicate that a third of the expression of the SPI2 spiC gene recorded in nonactivated macrophages depends on PhoQ .
Transcription of spiC is repressed in IFN - - primed macrophages in an iNOS - dependent manner , irrespective of the phoQ status of the bacteria .
Transcription of spiC is restored in IFN - - treated , iNOS - deficient macrophages to levels sustained by a phoQ mutant in nonactivated phagocytes , suggesting that most NO - dependent repression of spiC is due to the inhibition of PhoPQ - independent targets .
Comparison of the intracellular fitness of spiC , phoQ , and spiC phoQ mutants revealed that PhoPQ and SPI2 have codependent and independent effects on S. Typhimurium survival during innate nitrosative - stress .
However , the intracellular survival of most S. Typhimurium bacteria is conferred by the PhoPQ two - component regulator , and the SPI2 type III secretion system is repressed by high - order RNS of IFN - - activated macrophages .
The intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica has evolved a network of signal transduction pathways to withstand the barrage of host defenses encountered in nonfusogenic phagosomes in the form of antimicrobial peptides and acid - pH levels , as well as reactive oxygen species and reactive - nitrogen - species ( RNS ) .
The PhoPQ two - component signal transduction relay coordinates several aspects of the pathogenic lifestyle of S. Typhimurium ( 22 ) .
The PhoQ sensor kinase preferentially exerts phosphatase activity in resting Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( 7 ) ; however , exposure of the bacteria to antimicrobial peptides , low Mg 2 concentrations or acidic pH levels shifts phosphatase to autokinase activity , resulting in a net gain phosphorylation of PhoQ at His - 277 ( 2 , 3 , 21 , 51 ) .
The relay of this phosphate to PhoP Asp - 55 unleashes the direct or indirect transcription of over 200 loci ( 45 ) , many of which enhance the resistance of S. Typhimurium to acid pH levels , oxidative - stress , metals , bile , and antimicrobial peptides ( 3 , 8 , 21 , 27 , 29 , 59 ) .
Consequently , S. Typhimurium strains defective in PhoPQ signaling grow poorly in macrophages and are at least 10,000 - fold attenuated when tested in several experimental murine models of salmonellosis ( 19 , 43 ) .

against the enteropathogen S. Typhimurium .
The RNS emanating from inducible NO synthase ( iNOS ) enzymatic activity hasten the anti - Salmonella activities of human and murine macrophages while increasing the resistance of mice to systemic and gastrointestinal salmonellosis ( 1 , 38 , 56 , 60 , 63 , 64 ) .
The mechanisms by which RNS add to the anti - Salmonella arsenal of phagocytes are not completely understood .
NO and its congeners arrest DNA replication , damage DNA , and inhibit transcription of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) type III secretion system essential for S. Typhimurium virulence ( 39 , 52 , 53 ) .
In addition , RNS generated in acidic environments typical of gastric juice repress the PhoPQ - regulated acid tolerance response that protects rapidly growing S. Typhimurium bacteria against inorganic acid stress ( 5 ) .
S. Typhimurium is exposed to a similar repertoire of RNS within the gastric lumen and acidified phagosomes of gamma interferon ( IFN - ) - stimulated macrophages ( 36 , 40 ) .
NO itself , as well as nitrogen dioxide ( NO 2 ) and dinitrogen trioxide ( N 2 O 3 ) , arising from either the autooxidation of NO or the condensation of acidified nitrite ( HNO 2 ) , are similarly generated in the lumen of phagosomes and in the stomach ( 36 , 40 ) .
Because the PhoPQ signal transduction pathway is susceptible to inhibition by RNS produced under acidic conditions ( 5 ) , we set out to investigate whether the PhoP regulon is functional in the context of the nitrosative - stress engendered in the innate or IFN - - activated responses of professional phagocytes .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028s was used as the wild type and as a background for the construction of mutations and lacZY - transcriptional - fusions of both PhoP - activated genes and 5107 5108 BOURRET ET AL. .

The mutations were generated by following the Red - mediated gene replacement method ( 10 ) .
Primers encoding 60 nucleotides homologous to a target gene followed by 20 nucleotides homologous to the pKD13 template plasmid ( Table 2 ) were used for the PCR amplification of the Flp recombinant target ( FRT ) - flanked kanamycin resistance cassette .
The amplicons were DpnI digested and electroporated into S. Typhimurium strain TT22236 carrying the pTP2223 plasmid that expresses the Red recombinase under Ptac control .
Mutations were moved into S. Typhimurium strain 14028s by P22 - mediated transduction , and pseudolysogens were eliminated by streaking on Evans blue uranine agar plates .
In - frame deletions were generated by recombining the two FRT sites flanking the kanamycin resistance cassette with the Flp recombinase encoded in the pCP20 plasmid ( 9 ) .
The mutations were confirmed by PCR analysis .
Transcriptional lacZY fusions were constructed by pCP20 - mediated integration of the pCE36 plasmid carrying a promoterless lacZY operon into unique FRT scars ( 14 ) .
Effects of NO on in - vitro PhoPQ and SPI2 gene transcription .
Transcription of PhoP - activated genes and the spiC SPI2 gene was induced in - vitro by culturing S. Typhimurium in 8 M MgCl 2 N salts medium ( 12 ) .
Briefly , S. Typhimurium strains harboring lacZY transcriptional - fusions grown overnight in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium were subcultured 1:100 in high - Mg 2 N salts medium [ 5 mM KCl , 7.5 mM ( NH 4 ) SO 4 , 0.5 mM K 2 SO 4 ,1 mMKH 2 PO 4 , 38 mM glycerol , 0.1 % Casamino Acids supplemented with 10 mM MgCl 2 and 100 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7.6 ] .
The bacteria were grown at 37 °C in a shaker incubator until they reached an optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of 0.5 .
The cells were washed three times in 8 M MgCl 2 N salts medium , pH 6.9 , and cultured for the indicated amounts of time in 8 M MgCl 2 N salts medium , pH 6.9 , for the induction of PhoP - activated gene expression .
Spermine NONOate ( Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI ) dissolved in 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7.4 , was added to S. Typhimurium cultures at the beginning - of - growth in 8 M MgCl 2 N salts medium , pH 6.9 .
Alternatively , S. Typhimurium isolates grown overnight in LB broth were subcultured 1:50 in minimal EG medium [ 0.2 g/liter MgSO 4 , 2 g/liter C 6 H 8 O 7 - H 2 O , 10 g/liter K 2 HPO 4 , 3.5 g/liter Na ( NH 4 ) HPO 4 -4 H 2 O , and 4 g/liter D - glucose ] , pH 7.0 ( 62 ) .
The cultures were grown to an OD 600 of 0.4 ( 2 10 8 CFU/ml ) .
Acid - inducible expression of spiC was initiated by subculturing S. Typhimurium for 2hinfresh EG medium adjusted to pH 4.4 with HCl .
Selected cultures were grown in the presence or absence of 500 M spermine NONOate at 37 °C with shaking .
The expression of the lacZY transcriptional - fusions was quantified spectrophotometrically as - galactosidase enzymatic activity using the substrate o - nitrophenyl - - D - galactopyranoside .
- Galactosidase activity is expressed in Miller units using the following equation : 1,000 [ ( OD 420 1.75 OD 550 ) / ( T ( min ) V ( ml ) OD 600 ) ] .
Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from C57BL/6 and congenic B6.129S6 - Cybb tm1din / J ( gp91phox / ) ( 48 ) or iNOS / ( 37 ) mice 4 days TABLE 2 .

The peritoneal exudate cells were resuspended in RPMI medium ( RPMI 1640 cell culture medium [ Mediatech , Inc. , Manassas , VA ] supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum [ BioWhittaker Inc. , Walkersville , VA ] , 15 mM HEPES , 2mM L - glutamine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate [ Sigma - Aldrich , St. Louis , MO ] ) , containing 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin ( Mediatech ) .
The peritoneal exudate cells were seeded at either 4 10 5 cells/ml in 24 - well plates for phoP transcriptional studies or 2 10 5 cells/ml in 96 - well plates ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) for macrophage - killing and - galactosidase activity assays .
The macrophages were enriched by adherence after 48 h of culture at 37 °C ina5 % CO 2 incubator .
Where indicated , the macrophages were treated with 200 U/ml IFN - ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) for 18 h prior to S. Typhimurium infection .
Macrophages were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 2 with S. Typhimurium previously opsonized with 10 % normal mouse serum for 20 min .
Extracellular bacteria were removed from the monolayers 25 min after infection by washing with prewarmed RPMI medium containing 12 g/ml gentamicin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ( 39 ) .
The number of bacteria remaining in the macrophages at various times of infection was determined after lysis of host cells with 0.25 % deoxycholate and plating serial dilutions on LB agar plates .
Percent survival was calculated as ( CFU t n / CFU t 0 ) 100 , where CFU t n and CFU t 0 are the number of bacteria recovered after n hours and 25 min of infection , respectively .
Measurement of intracellular transcription of PhoP - activated genes and spiC .
The - galactosidase activity of S. Typhimurium strains harboring lpxO : : lacZY , pagP : : lacZY , orspiC : : lacZY transcriptional - fusions was studied in gp91phox / macrophages .

Synthesis of cDNA from S. Typhimurium - infected macrophages .
Total RNA was isolated from S. Typhimurium - infected , wild - type , or iNOS - deficient macrophages ( 39 ) .
Monolayers of S. Typhimurium - infected macrophages were solubilized in TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) containing silicon beads and processed in a bead - beater ( Biospec Products , Inc. , Bartlesville , OK ) .
RNA was extracted with chloroform , precipitated with a 1:1 mixture of isopropyl alcohol - 0.8 M sodium citrate solution , washed in ethanol , and dried in a speed vacuum .
RNA samples were resuspended in RNase/DNase - free H 2 O and digested for 1 h with DNase ( Promega , Madison , WI ) .
RNA was further purified with an RNAeasy kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) .
Complementary cDNA was synthesized at 42 °C for 30 min using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase ( Promega ) , RNasin , deoxynucleoside triphosphates , and random hexanucleotides .
The cDNA was used as a template for quantitative reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) and standard PCR analysis .
Quantitative RT - PCRs included cDNA , Takara Omnimix HS ( Takara Bio , Inc. , Japan ) , forward and reverse primers for the target genes , and fluorescently labeled DNA probes for the phoP gene or the housekeeping rpoD sigma factor ( Table 2 ) .
Real - time PCRs consisted of a cycle at 94 °C for 45 s ; 25 to 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s , 56 °C for 30 s , and 72 °C for 30 s ; and a cycle at 59 °C for 30 s .
The resulting fluorescence was measured with a SmartCycler II thermocycler ( Cepheid , Sunnyvale , CA ) .
Standard PCRs contained S. Typhimurium cDNA , deoxynucleoside triphosphates , Taq DNA polymerase ( Continental Lab Products , San Diego , CA ) , and forward and reverse primers for the PhoP - activated gene mig - 14 or the housekeeping gene rpoD ( Table 2 ) .
The iNOS activity expressed by S. Typhimuriuminfected macrophages was estimated by quantifying the NO oxidative end product NO 2 .
NO 2 was measured spectrophotometrically at 550 nm after mixing supernatants of S. Typhimurium - infected macrophages with an equal volume of the Griess reagent ( 0.5 % sulfanilamide and 0.05 % N - 1-naphthylethylenediamide hydrochloride in 2.5 % acetic acid ) .
The NO 2 concentration in the supernatants was determined by regression analysis using an NaNO 2 standard curve .
Data are presented as means standard errors of the mean ( SEM ) or SD .
The statistical significance between multiple comparisons was calculated with a two - way analysis of variance , followed by a Bonferroni posttest .
Data were considered statistically significant when the P value was 0.05 .
RESULTS NO inhibits PhoPQ - dependent gene transcription stimulated by low levels of Mg 2 .
Previous work demonstrated that RNS produced under acidic conditions typically found in the stomach inhibit the PhoPQ - dependent acid tolerance response of rapidly growing S. Typhimurium ( 5 ) .
We therefore examined whether RNS produced at a neutral pH affect PhoPQdependent gene expression .
As expected ( 21 ) , the PhoP - activated genes lpxO and pagP were induced in S. Typhimurium grown in 8 M MgCl 2 N salts medium , pH 6.9 ( Fig. 1A and D ) .
Consistent with the RNS - mediated antagonism of PhoPQ signaling seen in S. Typhimurium cultured in EG medium , pH 4.4 ( 5 ) , the NO - donor spermine NONOate repressed in a dosedependent manner the expression of lpxO and pagP sustained by S. Typhimurium grown in 8 M MgCl 2 N salts medium , pH 6.9 ( Fig. 1B and E ) .
Similar effects were seen with the PhoPactivated gene pmrD ( data not shown ) .
The inhibitory effects of spermine NONOate appear to be associated with its NO releasing capacity , since 500 M of the spermine control did not reduce lpxO : : lacZY or pagP : : lacZY transcriptional activity ( not shown ) .
Moreover , the NO - mediated inhibition of transcription of PhoP - activated genes can not be explained by the cytotoxicity of the drug , because the concentrations of spermine NONOate used here did not kill any of the S. Typhimurium strains tested ( not shown ) .
A total of 500 M spermine NONOate reduced the transcription of these PhoP - activated genes to the basal level seen in controls grown in noninducing , 10 mM MgCl 2 N salts medium , pH - 7.6 .
The RNS - mediated repression of these loci appears to act on or upstream of the functional PhoPQ signal transduction pathway , because the marginal lpxO and pagP expression sustained in the absence of a functional PhoQ was unaltered upon NO treatment ( Fig. 1C and F ) .
Collectively , published data ( 5 ) and the findings described above demonstrate that RNS inhibit the PhoPQdependent gene expression stimulated by a variety of environmental conditions .
PhoPQ - dependent gene transcription is repressed in NO - producing , IFN - - treated macrophages .
Next , we used gp91phox / macrophages to assess whether RNS generated by iNOS during innate or IFN - - primed responses of professional phagocytes affect PhoPQ - dependent gene transcription .
This population of macrophages was chosen because it does not kill S. Typhimurium isolates , yet it sustains the SPI2 - inhibitory nitrosative chemistry of wild - type phagocytes ( 40 ) .
The expression of lpxO and pagP was repressed ( P 0.001 ) in IFN - - stimulated , gp91phox - deficient macrophages ( Fig. 2A and C ) .
Addition of the NOS inhibitor NMMA not only reduced the NO output of IFN - - stimulated phagocytes ( Fig. 2B and D ) but restored lpxO and pagP transcription to the levels reported in unstimulated macrophages ( Fig. 2A and C ) .
The effect of host - derived RNS on PhoPQ - dependent gene transcription was independently studied by measuring the expression of mig - 14 .
Consistent with the lpxO and pagP transcription patterns , mig - 14 was repressed in an iNOS - dependent fashion inside IFN - - primed macrophages ( Fig. 2E ) .
Moreover , in accord with the expression patterns of the PhoP - activated genes pagP , lpxO , and mig - 14 , phoP transcripts were reduced about threefold in IFN - - treated macrophages compared to S. Typhimurium - infected , untreated phagocytes ( Fig. 2F ) .
These findings are in accord with the repression of phoP in S. Typhimurium exposed to NO in - vitro ( 5 ) .
The levels of phoP mRNA remained unaltered in iNOS - deficient macrophages independently of their state of activation ( Fig. 2F ) .
These data suggest that the RNS generated by IFN - - primed macrophages inhibit the expression of PhoP - activated genes at the level of the PhoPQ two - component regulatory system .
Contribution of RNS to the PhoQ - dependent intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium .
The PhoPQ two - component regulatory system is essential for the survival and proliferation of S. Typhimurium within professional phagocytes ( 18 , 43 ) .
Because RNS produced enzymatically repress intracellular PhoPdependent gene transcription ( Fig. 2 ) , the intracellular fitness of the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant was investigated in untreated or IFN - - treated macrophages with differential nitrosative capacities ( 40 ) .
Compared to isogenic wild - type bacteria , 10 - fold fewer S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant isolates were recovered from unstimulated macrophages isolated from C57BL/6 mice ( Fig. 3A ) .
IFN - increased both the iNOSdependent , nitrosative capacity of the macrophages ( Fig. 3C and D ) and the intracellular killing of the wild type and the S. 5110 BOURRET ET AL. .
NO inhibits PhoP - activated gene transcription .
Expression of PhoP - activated genes was quantified as - galactosidase activity of lpxO : : lacZY ( A to C ) or pagP : : lacZY ( D to F ) transcriptional - fusions .
A fraction of the bacteria grown in high ( H ) 10 mM MgCl 2 N salts medium to an OD 600 of 0.5 was cultured for 2hat37 °C in low ( L ) 8 M MgCl 2 N salts medium .
( B and E ) The NO - donor spermine NONOate was added to select cultures in 8 M MgCl 2 N salts medium .
Cultures indicated in panels C and F were treated with 500 M spermine NONOate .
The data represent the means SD of six independent observations from three separate experiments .
* , P value of 0.05 compared to untreated controls .
Typhimurium phoQ mutant ( Fig. 3A ) .
It should be noted that IFN - - primed macrophages contained twofold more wild - type than S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant isolates ( Fig. 3A ) .
Macrophages from iNOS - deficient mice were used to assess the contribution of RNS to the intracellular killing of the wild type and the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant ( Fig. 3B ) .
Unstimulated , iNOS - deficient macrophages harbored about two - and fivefold more wild - type and S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant isolates , respectively ( Fig. 3B ) , than iNOS - sufficient controls ( Fig. 3A ) .
Conversely , NO congeners generated by IFN - - primed macrophages appear to play a greater role controlling wild - type S. Typhimurium than the phoQ - deficient strain .
IFN - - treated , iNOS - deficient macrophages harbored 10 - fold more wild - type bacteria than IFN - - treated , iNOS - sufficient controls , whereas fourfold increases were seen in IFN - - treated , iNOS - deficient phagocytes infected with the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant .
Wild - type bacteria were still isolated in higher numbers than phoQ isogenic controls from IFN - - treated , iNOS - deficient macrophages .
Together , these findings identify the PhoQ sensor kinase as a critical determinant of the antinitrosative defenses of the intracellular pathogen S. Typhimurium .
RNS repress intracellular SPI2 gene transcription by targeting PhoQ - independent signaling pathways .
The iNOS - dependent inhibition of the PhoP regulon sustained by IFN - - primed macrophages ( Fig. 2 ) closely resembles the NO - mediated inhibition of SPI2 transcription seen in activated macrophages ( 39 ) .
Since PhoPQ signaling can control SPI2 transcription ( 4 , 12 , 65 ) , it is possible that the repression of SPI2 by NO congeners is a manifestation of adverse effects on PhoPQ .
To test this hypothesis , spiC : : lacZY transcriptional activity was investigated in the wild type and the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant exposed to NO congeners .
As reported for a variety of SPI2 loci ( 5 , 39 , 40 ) , treatment of S. Typhimurium with 500 M spermine NONOate repressed the spiC : : lacZY expression induced in 8 M MgCl 2 N salts medium ( Fig. 4A ) .
In the absence of the sensor kinase PhoQ , not only was spiC : : lacZY unresponsive to VOL .

Inhibition of PhoP - activated gene transcription by NO - producing , IFN - - treated macrophages .
( A and C ) Intracellular PhoP - activated gene expression was quantified in untreated or IFN - - primed gp91phox / macrophages by following the - galactosidase activity of lpxO : : lacZY and pagP : : lacZY transcriptional - fusions 8 h after infection .
( B and D ) A total of 250 M of the competitive NOS inhibitor NMMA was added to selected groups of gp91phox / macrophages at the time of S. Typhimurium infection .
Macrophage NO 2 synthesis was quantified by the Griess reaction 8 h after infection .
Data in panels A to D represent the mean SD of six to nine replicates from two to three separate experiments .

low MgCl 2 levels , but its basal level of expression was unaltered by NO .
In contrast to the predominant role that PhoPQ signaling exerts on SPI2 expression in S. Typhimurium grown in medium with low levels of Mg 2 , less than 50 % of the acidinducible spiC : : lacZY transcription appears to depend on PhoQ ( Fig. 4B ) .
Treatment of S. Typhimurium with 500 M spermine NONOate completely inhibited the phoQ - dependent and - independent spiC : : lacZY expression induced at low pH levels ( Fig. 4B ) .
As we have described for phoP - activated genes ( 5 ) , a shift to pH 4.4 not only stimulated spiC : : lacZY transcription ( Fig. 4B ) but also stopped bacterial growth ( not shown ) .
To determine if the iNOS - dependent inhibition of PhoP - activated gene transcription ( Fig. 2 ) contributes to the intracellular repression of SPI2 ( 39 ) , spiC : : lacZY transcriptional activity was tested in the wild type and the phoQ - deficient S. Typhimurium mutant in macrophages from gp91phox / mice .
This population of macrophages was selected because it does not kill S. Typhimurium , irrespective of the spiC status of the bacterium ( 39 ) .
To minimize further the effect that small variations in the intracellular bacterial burden may have on the estimation of spiC : : lacZY expression , - galactosidase activity was standardized to 10 6 CFU by counting the surviving bacteria capable of forming a colony on LB agar plates .
spiC : : lacZY expression was significantly ( P 0.01 ) reduced in the absence of a functional phoQ ( Fig. 4C ) .
In fact , a third of the intracellular spiC transcription sustained in unstimulated macrophages is dependent on a functional phoQ allele .
This observation appears to support the idea that the intracellular expression of spiC relies on both PhoQ - dependent and - independent signals .
The spiC : : lacZY expression sustained by the wild type and the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant was nonetheless repressed to similar levels in IFN - - primed macrophages ( Fig. 4C ) .
The NOS inhibitor NMMA restored spiC : : lacZY expression of both the wild type and the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant in IFN - - primed macrophages to levels sustained by the S. Typhimurium mutant in unstimulated phagocytes ( Fig. 4C ) .
Collectively , these data indicate that the RNS of IFN - - primed macrophages repress PhoQ - dependent and - independent signaling .
Our data also indicate that the NO - dependent repression of in - 5112 BOURRET ET AL. .
The PhoQ - mediated intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium is lost in NO - producing , IFN - - primed macrophages .
The antimicrobial activity of untreated or IFN - - treated macrophages from C57BL/6 ( B6 ) ( A ) and iNOS / ( iNOS ) ( B ) mice was recorded 20 h after infection with the wild type ( WT ) or the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant .
The nitrite - producing capacity of untreated and IFN - - treated macrophages from B6 ( C ) or iNOS - deficient ( D ) mice was determined 20 h after infection .
The data represent the mean percent survival SEM of 14 independent observations from four separate experiments .
* , P value of 0.001 compared to WT controls .
tracellular spiC transcription seems to occur through the inhibition of PhoQ - independent signaling .
RNS produced by IFN - - primed macrophages abrogate PhoQ - and SPI2 - dependent intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium .
The contributions of the PhoPQ two - component regulatory and SPI2 type III secretion systems to the intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium were next investigated .
Compared to wild - type controls , S. Typhimurium isolates harboring mutations in either phoQ or spiC were hypersusceptible to the antimicrobial activities of unstimulated , immunocompetent macrophages ( Fig. 5A ) .
It should be noted that twofold fewer S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant isolates were consistently ( P 0.05 ) recovered from the macrophages than spiC isogenic controls , indicating that PhoPQ plays a role in the intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium independent of its control of SPI2 .
Likewise , some of the contributions of SPI2 to the intracellular fitness of S. Typhimurium appear to be independent of PhoQ function , as suggested by the fact that a phoQ spiC double mutant was significantly ( P 0.05 ) more attenuated than S. Typhimurium deficient for only phoQ or spiC ( Fig. 5A ) .
The number of phoQ spiC S. Typhimurium bacteria isolated from unstimulated macrophages was similar to the number of wild - type bacteria isolated from IFN - - primed macrophages ( Fig. 5A ) .
The survival advantage associated with PhoQ and SPI2 was still manifested in untreated or IFN - - treated macrophages lacking iNOS ( Fig. 5B ) .
Collectively , these data suggest that NO congeners produced by IFN - - primed macrophages abrogate codependent and independent PhoPQ and SPI2 functions critical to the intracellular fitness of S. Typhimurium .
DISCUSSION Because PhoPQ - dependent gene transcription is subject to repression by RNS generated under acidic conditions typically found in the stomach ( 5 ) , we reasoned that PhoPQ signaling FIG. 4 .
NO inhibits intracellular SPI2 transcription in PhoQ - independent ways .
SPI2 expression was measured in the wild type ( WT ) and in the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant strain harboring a spiC : : lacZY transcriptional - fusion .
SPI2 expression was induced in 8 M MgCl 2 N salts medium ( A ) or in EG medium , pH 4.4 ( B ) .
A total of 500 M spermine NONOate was added to selected cultures .
Intracellular spiC : : lacZY expression by the wild type or the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant was quantified in untreated or IFN - - primed gp91phox / macrophages 8 h after infection .
( C ) Selected groups of IFN - - primed macrophages were treated with 250 M NMMA at the time of infection .
Data in panels A to C represent the means SD of six replicates from two separate experiments .
* , P value of 0.05 compared with untreated controls .

The data represent the mean percent survival SEM of three to six independent observations from two separate experiments .
* , P value of 0.001 compared to WT controls ; ** , P value of 0.05 compared to phoQ controls .
may also be inhibited by the nitrosative and oxidative - stress associated with RNS of IFN - - stimulated macrophages ( 36 , 40 ) .
The repression of the PhoP - activated genes lpxO , pagP , and mig - 14 by NO congeners of IFN - - stimulated macrophages lends support to this hypothesis .
NO generated in - vitro in low - Mg 2 or acidic environments , which may recapitulate some aspects of the intraphagosomal environment , also repressed PhoPQ signaling .
The mechanism for the NO - mediated inhibition of PhoPQ signaling is unknown at this time .
NO inhibits the expression of the PhoP regulon in a low - Mg 2 environment known to directly activate the PhoQ sensor kinase .
It is therefore possible that the RNS - dependent repression of PhoP - activated genes occurs at the level of the PhoPQ two - component regulatory system .
Alternatively , the repression of the PhoP regulon may reflect the overall decrease of transcription and translation seen in S. Typhimurium undergoing nitrosative - stress ( 5 ) .
It should be noted , however , that not all gene transcripts are affected equally in response to NO .
For instance , NO downregulates about 10 % of the S. Typhimurium transcriptome , of which SPI2 and PhoP - regulated genes are overwhelmingly represented , while RNS upregulate the transcription of approximately 10 % of the genome ( 5 ) .
On the other hand , the fact that RNS inhibit the expression of spiC and PhoP - activated genes triggered at pH 4.4 in nondividing S. Typhimurium bacteria ( 5 ; see above ) argues against the idea that the NO - mediated repression of transcription is an indirect manifestation of its effects on bacterial growth .
Regardless of the mechanism of action , and given that S. Typhimurium bacteria harboring mutations in the PhoPQ two - component regulatory system grow poorly in macrophages and are highly attenuated in murine models of salmonellosis ( 18 , 43 ) , the RNS - mediated inhibition of the PhoP regulon represents a novel mechanism by which IFN - may contribute to host defense against this intracellular pathogen .
As expected ( 18 , 43 ) , the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant was attenuated in macrophages .
Defects in the iNOS hemoprotein increased the virulence of the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant during the innate and IFN - - primed responses of macrophages .
These data demonstrate a hitherto unknown role for the PhoPQ system in resistance to NO congeners of professional phagocytes .
Despite growing better in iNOS - deficient macrophages , the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant bacteria were still more readily killed by phagocytes unable to produce NO than isogenic wild - type bacteria .
The known role of PhoPQ in remodeling the cell envelope may help explain the hypersusceptibility of the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant to the killing activity of iNOS - deficient macrophages .
PhoP - activated genes mediate resistance to a broad spectrum of defensins and - helical peptides ( 28 , 29 , 35 , 41 , 44 , 54 , 55 ) .
Specifically , the outer membrane protease encoded by the PhoP - activated gene pgtE cleaves the - helical peptide C18G ( 30 ) , while the PhoP - regulated gene products of lpxO , pagP , pmrC , ugd , and ugtL reduce the permeability of the outer membranes of S. Typhimurium cells ( 46 ) .
LpxO - mediated hydroxylations stabilize the outer membrane by promoting hydrogen bonding between lipid - A molecules , while the PagP - dependent palmitoylation increases hydrophobic interactions between the acyl chains of lipid - A ( 25 , 26 , 32 , 46 ) .
The negative charge of lipid A is reduced either by the PmrC - and Ugd - mediated addition of phosphoethanolamine and 4 - aminoarabinose or by the UgtLcatalyzed reduction of phosphorylation ( 28 , 31 , 35 ) .
Finally , PhoP - mediated activation of mig - 14 confers resistance to biologically active antimicrobial peptides by a yet unknown mechanism ( 6 , 47 ) .
Consequently , by repressing the PhoP - activated lpxO , pagP , and mig - 14 genes , RNS generated by IFN - - primed macrophages may increase the sensitivity of S. Typhimurium to host antimicrobial peptides .
Decreased antioxidant defenses may have also contributed to the enhanced susceptibility of the S. Typhimurium mutant to the antibacterial activity of iNOS - deficient macrophages .
The PhoPQ regulatory system coordinates various antioxidant defenses .
On one hand , the PhoP - activated gene product IraP protects S. Typhimurium from H 2 O 2 cytotoxicity by stabilizing S levels ( 58 ) .
On the other hand , PhoP activates the expression of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase CI ( 27 ) , which is indispensable for full S. Typhimurium virulence in mice and survival within macrophages ( 11 ) .
Lastly , as discussed below , PhoP optimizes intracellular expression of the SPI2 type III secretion system associated with S. Typhimurium evasion of the NADPH phagocyte oxidase ( 20 , 57 , 61 ) .
The inhibition of PhoPQ - dependent signaling by RNS generated in IFN - - stimulated macrophages may therefore enhance the exposure of S. Typhimurium biomolecules to intracellular oxidative - stress .
It is still unclear whether and to what extent PhoPQ regulates SPI2 transcription ( 4 , 12 , 16 , 17 , 23 , 33 , 34 , 42 , 65 , 66 ) .
Under our experimental conditions , it appears that about one third of the intracellular expression of the SPI2 spiC gene depends on an intact PhoPQ signaling system .
This observation is consistent with the partial contribution of PhoQ to the regulation of spiC under acidic conditions , but it contrasts with the tight control that PhoPQ exerts on spiC in Mg 2 poor environments .
Inhibition of NOS activity restored the intracellular expression of spiC : : lacZY in both the wild type and the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant to levels sustained by the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant in unstimulated phagocytes , suggesting that the NO - dependent repression of intracellular spiC transcription occurs mostly through the inhibition of PhoQ - independent signaling .
Therefore , NO must inhibit presently unknown targets .
The two - component regulatory systems SsrA/SsrB and EnvZ/OmpR or the MarR - like regulator SlyA , all known regulators of SPI2 transcription ( 15 , 66 ) , are among these possible targets .
Cysteine and tyrosine residues are preferred amino - acid targets of RNS .
With the exception of EnvZ and OmpR , all these regulatory proteins have one or more cysteine , while all but SlyA contain tyrosines .
Future investigations will be needed to determine whether SsrA , SsrB , EnvZ , OmpR , or SlyA contains redox active residues that impart regulatory functions to these proteins .
Our data indicate that PhoPQ and SPI2 are primary targets of the RNS - dependent anti - S .
Typhimurium activity of IFN - activated macrophages , as shown by the fact that a phoQ spiC double mutant was killed as efficiently by untreated phagocytes as by IFN - - treated macrophages , irrespective of their nitrosative capacities .
The data presented herein also show that the functions of PhoPQ and SPI2 overlap to a great extent .
This could be explained by the aforementioned regulation of SPI2 by PhoP .
However , PhoPQ and SPI2 may also act independently to establish a nonfusogenic phagosome that avoids contact with known oxygen - dependent and - independent host defenses ( 24 ) .
Although the protective mechanisms of PhoPQ and SPI2 appear to antagonize common host defenses , our investigations suggest some specialized functions as well .
For example , the S. Typhimurium phoQ mutant is consistently less fit for survival in the intracellular environment than spiC - deficient isogenic controls .
Moreover , a strain of S. Typhimurium lacking both phoQ and spiC is significantly more attenuated than controls bearing single mutations .
In summary , we have shown that the PhoPQ two - component regulatory system plays an important role in defending S. Typhimurium against NO congeners generated in the innate response , while it becomes a target of RNS engendered by activated phagocytes .
The RNS - dependent inhibition of PhoPQ signaling and SPI2 type III secretion may expose S. Typhimurium to a deluge of antimicrobial effectors as varied as oxyradicals generated by the NADPH phagocyte oxidase or hydrolytic enzymes and antimicrobial peptides of the degradative pathway , thereby contributing to the cytotoxicity of the NO congeners of activated macrophages .
