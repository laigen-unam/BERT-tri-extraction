The transcriptional regulator CsgD is the major target for these regulatory pathways .
In this study , we show that two lytic transglycosylases of family I , MltE and MltC , in combination increase CsgD expression and rdar morphotype .
MltE and MltC , which share a highly similar transglycosylase SLT domain , work redundantly to regulate CsgD at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .
The effect of MltE and MltC on CsgD levels was independent of the known regulatory pathways that sense cell envelope stress .
These findings reveal , for the first time , a specific function of lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium and suggest the existence of a new signaling pathway that links cell wall turnover to biofilm formation .
Biofilm formation is the most common mode of growth of bacteria .
The food - borne gastrointestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) establishes biofilms on a variety of surfaces , such as those of plants , the eukaryotic host , industrial equipment , and medical supplies .
Under laboratory conditions , S. Typhimurium biofilms are manifested as a distinct colony morphotype on Congo red agar plates , named rdar , due to the red dry and rough colony appearance .
This form of biofilm is characterized by the expression of cellulose and curli fimbriae , two major extracellular matrix components in S. Typhimurium ( 7 , 44 , 56 , 64 ) .
The transcriptional regulator CsgD is the major regulator of the rdar morphotype ( 11 , 48 ) .
CsgD positively regulates the transcription of the csgBAC operon , which encodes the structural subunits for curli fimbriae ( 18 , 49 ) , and contributes indirectly to cellulose production by activating the transcription of adrA ( 48 , 63 ) .
AdrA is a diguanylate cyclase that synthesizes the second messenger cyclic - di - GMP ( c - di - GMP ) , the effector molecule that binds to and allosterically activates cellulose synthase ( 55 , 64 ) .
CsgD expression integrates many environmental signals .
Several diverse proteins bind to the csgD promoter , including the stress sigma factor RpoS and the response regulator OmpR ( 11 , 12 , 39 , 45 ) .
In addition , CsgD is regulated by the second messenger c - di - GMP at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels ( 29 ) .
Two redundant small RNAs , OmrA and OmrB , control CsgD expression on a posttranscriptional level , although their effect is not pronounced under growth on Tumor and Cell Biology , Karolinska Institutet , FE28017177 , Stockholm , Sweden .

The regulation of the rdar morphotype therefore integrates a variety of complex regulatory systems .
Lytic transglycosylases are a class of ubiquitous bacterial enzymes involved in the turnover of the bacterial cell wall constituent peptidoglycan ( PG ) .
Lytic transglycosylases catalyze the cleavage of the -1,4 - glycosidic bond between N - acetylmuramic acid and N - acetylglucosamine with anhydromuropeptide monomers as products ( 23 ) .
Escherichia coli harbors seven lytic transglycosylases , the soluble Slt70 and six outer membrane - anchored lipoproteins , MltA to MltF ( 52 ) .
Lytic transglycosylases have redundant functions .
Although Slt is the principal lytic transglycosylase responsible for the turnover of PG ( 41 ) , the deletion of as many as six lytic transglycosylases is required for an observable effect on cell morphology and the cleavage of the PG septum ( 19 ) .
Four different families of lytic transglycosylases can be distinguished ( 4 ) .
However , due to functional redundancy , the correlation of function with family assignment is limited .
Lytic transglycosylases are involved in the biosynthesis and recycling of the PG sacculus during cell growth and division , as well as in the insertion of macromolecular complexes spanning the cell wall ( 22 , 30 , 52 ) .
In E. coli , half of the cell wall is broken down in one generation ( 15 ) .
The anhydromuropeptide monomers formed as a result of PG hydrolysis are reused directly or transported into the cytoplasm through the permease AmpG ( 34 ) .
In the cytoplasm , the PG degradation products have a signaling function in the regulatory network sensing cell wall turnover ( 26 , 27 ) .
Together with other PG degrading enzymes , lytic transglycosylases separate daughter cells through the cleavage of the septum during cell division ( 19 ) .
Lytic transglycosylases also hydrolyze PG to make space for the insertion of macromolecular complexes , e.g. , type III secretion systems , flagella , and pili ( 40 , 62 ) .
In addition to these functions , lytic transglycosylases contribute to bacterium - host interaction , because anhydromuropeptide monomers are recognized by eukaryotic pattern rec - 6443 6444 MONTEIRO ET AL. .
Bacteria as diverse as Bordetella pertussis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , and Vibrio fischeri release significant amounts of anhydromuropeptides , which are required for both virulence and symbiosis ( 14 , 31 , 37 ) .
In this study , we show that two of seven family I lytic transglycosylases from S. Typhimurium , MltE and MltC , are specifically involved in the regulation of biofilm formation by affecting the expression of the master biofilm regulator CsgD .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bioinformatic analysis .
A search with the MltE protein sequence using BLAST ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) at NCBI ( http://www.ncbi.nlm .
nih.gov / ) with standard parameters was done to identify lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium .
Sequences were aligned using CLUSTALX 2.0.12 software ( 57 ) .
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using Dendroscope software ( 25 ) .
The domain architecture was analyzed using the Pfam database ( 10 ) .
Strains , plasmids , and growth - conditions .
Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material .
The MAE52 strain differs from the wild - type UMR1 by a single point mutation in the csgD promoter , resulting in semiconstitutive , temperature - independent CsgD and rdar morphotype expression .
In this strain , csgD expression is independent of RpoS ( 49 ) .
For rdar morphotype analysis , strains were grown in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium without salt or on LB without salt agar .
If required , antibiotics and inducers were added at the following concentrations : chloramphenicol ( 20 g ml 1 ) , ampicillin ( 100 g ml 1 ) , and 0.1 % arabinose .
For cloning purposes , Escherichia coli and S. Typhimurium were grown on LB and LB agar plates supplemented with antibiotics .
Construction of strains and plasmids .
The deletion of genes was performed by one - step gene inactivation as described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 8 ) .
A chloramphenicol resistance marker replaced the gene of interest with the exclusion of the first and last 40 bp .
Phage transduction was carried out using phage P22 HT105/1 int - 201 ( 53 ) .
Mutant alleles were verified by PCR with control primers located up - and downstream of the targeted open reading frame ( ORF ) ( see Table S2 in the supplemental material ) .
In general , the genes were cloned with a C - terminal 6 His tag in the vector pBAD30 .
mltE and mltC with a glutamic - acid - to - glutamine replacement at positions 64 and 219 were constructed by PCR - based mutagenesis using overlapping primers containing the mutations and subsequently cloned into pBAD30 ( 17 ) , resulting in pCPM14 and pCPM15 .
To construct plasmids for protein purification , DNA fragments of the transglycosylase SLT domains of S. Typhimurium MltE and MltC proteins ( wild - type and mutants ) were cloned into vector pMAL - c2x ( NEB ) in frame with the maltose - binding protein ( MBP ) .
The MltE protein contained residues 34 to 202 , and the MltC protein contained residues 189 to 325 .
All recombinant plasmids were confirmed by sequencing .
The primers used to construct and sequence the plasmids are listed in Table S2 in the supplemental material .
Phenotypic evaluation of rdar morphotype formation .
To detect curli fimbriae and cellulose production , the colony morphology phenotype was assessed on Congo red agar plates using the spot test .
Strains were precultured on LB agar plates at 37 °C for approximately 16 h. Cells were suspended in LB - medium and adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of 3 .
Five microliters of the suspension was spotted on LB without salt agar plates supplemented with Congo red ( 40 g ml 1 ) and Coomassie brilliant blue G - 250 ( 20 g ml 1 ) .
The phenotype was observed after 24 h , if not otherwise indicated .
Bacteria were grown on LB without salt agar plates at 28 °C for 17 h. Five mg ( wet weight ) cells was harvested , resuspended in 200 l sample buffer , and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min .
The total protein content was analyzed by Coomassie blue staining after gel separation .
Equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS - PAGE ( 12 % resolving gel and 4 % stacking gel ) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Immobilon P ; Millipore ) .
Detection of CsgD was carried out as described previously ( 48 ) using a polyclonal anti - CsgD peptide antibody ( 1:5,000 ) and horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( 1:2,000 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. ) .
His tag was detected with a monoclonal penta - His antibody ( 1:2,000 ; Qiagen ) and horseradish peroxidase - conjugated anti - mouse IgG ( 1:10,000 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. ) .
Chemiluminescence ( Lumi - Light WB substrate ; Roche ) was recorded using the Las - 1000 system ( Fuji Film ) and quantified with ImageJ software ( http://rsb .
CsgA was detected after an enrichment procedure ( 46 ) .
Bacteria were grown on LB agar plates without salt at 28 °C for 17 h. Three mg of bacteria was harvested and resuspended in 1.5 ml TE ( 10 mM Tris , 1 mM EDTA , pH 7.5 ) with 2 % SDS , followed by an incubation at 95 °C for 45 min .
Afterwards the sample was centrifuged , and the pellet washed with water and finally resuspended in 30 l water .
The suspension was lyophilized and the pellet dissolved in 20 l formic acid to depolymerize curli fimbriae .
After the removal of the formic acid , the CsgA - enriched pellet was resuspended in 20 l SDS sample buffer and 7 l was loaded on the gel ( 15 % separating gel with a 4 % stacking gel , with a double concentration of buffer in the separation gel and running buffer ) .
After the run , CsgA was visualized by staining the gel with colloidal Coomassie .
RNA extraction , cDNA synthesis , and quantitative real - time reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) .
Bacteria were grown on LB without salt agar plates at 28 °C for 17 h and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after harvest .
The extraction of total RNA was performed using the SV total RNA isolation system ( Promega ) with minor modifications ( 16 ) .
The quality of RNA samples was assessed by gel electrophoresis , and RNA concentrations were determined using the NanoDrop System ( Thermo Scientific ) .
cDNA synthesis from total RNA was performed with the high - capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit ( Applied Biosystems ) by following the manufacturer 's instructions .
The expression of the genes of interest was determined by two - step real - time RT - PCR using the power SYBR green PCR master mix ( Applied Biosystems ) and the 7500 real - time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems ) .
Relative transcript abundance was determined with the 2 CT method using 7500 SDS software , v1 .3.1 ( Applied Biosystems ) .
The rpsV gene was used as an endogenous control for internal normalization .
Experiments were performed as biological triplicates using the mean expression from quadruplicates per real - time PCR assay relative to a calibrator value ( UMR1 ) .
The MBP - MltE and MBP - MltC fusions were expressed in E. coli DH5 .
The proteins were induced at an optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of 0.6 using 0.5 mM isopropyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) for 3 h .
The proteins were partially purified from the cell extracts using affinity chromatography on amylose resin by following the manufacturer 's protocol ( NEB ) .
Cell wall hydrolytic activities were detected after the separation of the wholecell protein extracts , or partially purified MBP - MltE and MBP - MltC proteins , using 12 % denaturing SDS - PAGE according to the method reported previously ( 3 , 32 ) .
Briefly , the samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) and resolved by 12 % SDS - PAGE containing 0.6 % ( wt/vol ) lyophilized cells of Micrococcus lysodeikticus ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) .
After PAGE , the gel was briefly rinsed with water and renaturation buffer ( 25 mM sodium phosphate , 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.1 % Triton X - 100 ) with gentle agitation at room temperature .
The gel was incubated overnight in 500 ml of renaturation buffer at 30 °C followed by an incubation for 24 h at 37 °C .
The cell wall material in the gel was stained with 0.1 % methylene blue in 0.01 % KOH .
The gel subsequently was destained with water until unstained autolytic bands appeared on the blue background ( 32 ) .
To perform light and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , strains were grown on LB agar plates without salt at 28 °C for 24 h. For TEM , cells were harvested , fixed using 2 % glutaraldehyde , and resuspended in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) .
TEM was performed by the electron microscopy unit ( EMil ) of the Karolinska Institutet .
RESULTS Lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium .
The c - di - GMPbinding protein YcgR is involved in the transition of motile cells to sessility at high intracellular c - di - GMP concentrations ( 5 , 42 , 51 ) .
In several enterobacterial species , including S. Typhimurium , E. coli , Shigella , Klebsiella , and Erwinia , the ycgR and mltE genes are located next to each other and are transcribed in opposite directions .
To investigate a potential link between MltE and c - di - GMP metabolism or c - di - GMP - controlled functions , we investigated the impact of mltE coding for a family I lytic transglycosylase on biofilm formation ( rdar morphotype expression ) in S. Typhimurium .
The mltE deletion mutant did not show a change in rdar morphotype expression compared to its expression in the S. VOL .

MltE in combination with MltC affects the expression of the rdar morphotype through CsgD .
( A ) Wild - type S. Typhimurium UMR1 and mutants of lytic transglycosylases MltE and MltC grown on Congo red agar plates at 28 °C for 24 h .
The mltE and mltC single mutants do not show any difference in rdar morphotype expression compared to that of wild - type UMR1 , while the mltE mltC double mutant shows a visible downregulation of rdar morphotype expression .
( B ) MltE overexpression enhanced the rdar morphotype expression of UMR1 compared to that of the strain containing the vector control .
Spot colonies were grown on Congo red agar plates at 28 °C for 7 days .
VC , vector control pBAD30 .
( C ) CsgD and CsgA expression in S. Typhimurium UMR1 and its mltE and mltC mutants .
Compared to wild - type UMR1 , a significant reduction of CsgD and CsgA expression is observed in the mltE mltC double mutant .
No change in CsgD and CsgA levels is detected in the mltE and mltC single mutants .
The strains UMR1 csgD and UMR1 csgA were used as negative controls ( n.c. ) for CsgD and CsgA detection , respectively .
Strains were grown on LB without NaCl agar at 28 °C for 17 h. Typhimurium wild - type UMR1 ( Fig. 1A ) .
On the other hand , the overexpression of MltE from a plasmid led to an upregulated rdar morphotype after 17 h , and upon extended incubation it manifested as an extended matrix structure on Congo red agar plates ( Fig. 1B ) .
It is important to note that the overexpression of MltE did not result in the retardation of growth or cell lysis ( data not shown ) .
To investigate whether the lack of the phenotype of the mltE mutant was due to functional redundancy among lytic transglycosylases , we deleted genes encoding family I lytic transglycosylases in the wild - type , UMR1 , and mltE genetic backgrounds .
A homology search identified seven lytic transglycosylases belonging to family I in S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 2A and B ) .
Six single deletion mutants ( mltE , mltC , PSLT072 , STM4217 , mltD , and slt mutants ) , excluding the most distantly related yfhD ( mltF ) mutant , were investigated and showed no change in rdar morphotype expression ( data not shown ) .
The analysis of all possible double mutants , however , revealed a significant downregulation of the rdar morphotype in the mltE mltC double mutant , which manifested as a white and smooth colony appearance after 24 h of growth ( Fig. 1A ) .
We also overexpressed the remaining five lytic transglycosylases individually ( mltC , PSLT072 , STM4217 , mltD , and slt ) , but rdar morphotype expression was not altered compared to that of the wild type ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate a specific involvement of MltE and MltC in rdar morphotype expression .
MltE and MltC have different domain structures .
While MltE contains only the transglycosylase SLT domain , MltC is composed of two domains , the domain of unknown function , DUF3393 , at the N terminus and the SLT domain at the C terminus ( Fig. 2C ) .
The SLT domains of MltE and MltC share 38 % identity , which is the highest identity between transglycosylase SLT domains in S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 2A and B ) .
Therefore , it is possible that the close phylogenetic relationship between the SLT domains of MltE and MltC is the basis for their apparent functional redundancy in rdar morphotype expression .
MltE and MltC regulate expression of the extracellular matrix components through CsgD .
To gain insight into the mechanism responsible for the effect of MltE and MltC on biofilm formation , we measured expression levels of the master transcriptional activator CsgD and the levels of one of the main matrix components , curli fimbriae .
The expression of curli fimbriae was monitored by the assessment of the amount of monomeric CsgA , the structural subunit released following formic acid - mediated fimbriae depolymerization .
The mltE or mltC single mutant showed no differences from the wild - type UMR1 , while the mltE mltC double mutant showed a clear reduction in CsgD and CsgA protein levels ( Fig. 1C ) .
CsgD expression levels were reduced to approximately 30 % in the mltE mltC double mutant compared to that of wild - type UMR1 .
To investigate at which level MltE and MltC regulate CsgD expression , the csgD mRNA levels were determined by realtime RT - PCR ( Fig. 3A ) .
The csgD mRNA levels in the mltE mltC double mutant were about 47 % of the levels of the wild type .
Therefore , MltE and MltC appear to regulate CsgD expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels .
When MltE was expressed from a plasmid in the mltE mltC double mutant , the csgD mRNA levels were restored to wild - type levels ( Fig. 3A ) .
Also , rdar morphotype expression and CsgD and CsgA protein levels reached or exceeded wildtype levels in the mltE mltC double mutant upon the overexpression of MltE but not MltC ( Fig. 3B and C and data not shown ) .
An investigation of the level of MltC expression revealed that MltC is expressed at significantly lower levels than MltE despite the fact that they had identical promoters and ribosome - binding sites ( data not shown ) .
Low MltC from plasmid expression may be responsible for the lack of restoration of rdar morphotype expression .
The catalytic activities of MltE and MltC are responsible for the effect on the rdar morphotype .
To investigate whether the transglycosylase activities of MltE and MltC were required for rdar morphotype expression , we constructed point mutations in both proteins that were expected to decrease or abolish their activities .
Lytic transglycosylases of family I share a conserved E - S motif ( 4 ) , where the glutamyl residue is directly involved in catalysis ( 58 ) .
We replaced the glutamyl residues in the E - S motif with glutamines ( E653Q in MltE and E2193Q in 6446 MONTEIRO ET AL. .
Phylogenetic analysis of the transglycosylase SLT domains of the lytic transglycosylases of S. Typhimurium .
( A ) Amino acid alignment of transglycosylase SLT domains of S. Typhimurium .
The catalytic E - S motif is a characteristic of SLT family I domains .
( B ) Phylogenetic tree indicating the relatedness of SLT domains of lytic transglycosylases .
MltE and MltC lytic transglycosylase SLT domains are highly related .
The tree was constructed using Dendroscope .
( C ) Domain architecture of MltE and MltC .
MltE contains only a transglycosylase SLT domain .
MltC is composed of an N - terminal DUF3393 domain and a C - terminal transglycosylase SLT domain .
The diamond indicates the catalytic residues of MltE and MltC ( E64 and E219 , respectively ) .
When the mutant MltE and MltC proteins were expressed from plasmids ( pCPM14 and pCPM15 , respectively ) , they could not restore the rdar morphotype in the mltE mltC double mutant ( Fig. 4A and data not shown ) .
Interestingly , the overexpression of MltE E65Q resulted in a mucoid phenotype ( Fig. 4A ) , suggesting that the expression of the protein lacking the catalytic activity imposed envelope stress ( 35 , 36 ) .
Complementation of the S. Typhimurium UMR1 mltE mltC double mutant by MltE .
( A ) Expression of csgD in the wild - type S. Typhimurium UMR1 and the mltE mltC double mutant was determined by quantitative real - time RT - PCR .
csgD mRNA levels decreased in the mltE mltC double mutant compared to those of wild - type UMR1 .
The expression of MltE from a plasmid restored csgD mRNA to wild - type UMR1 levels .
VC , vector control pBad30 .
A decrease in csgD mRNA levels in the MAE52 mltE mltC double mutant also was observed .
The strain UMR1 ompR was used as a negative control ( 45 ) .
Bacteria were grown on LB agar plates without salt at 28 °C for 17 h .
The experiment was performed with three biological replicates , using the mean expression values from four technical replicates .
( B ) Rdar morphotype expression in the double mutant UMR1 mltE mltC is complemented with a plasmid expressing MltE but not MltC .
Strains were grown on Congo red agar at 28 °C for 24 h. ( C ) CsgD and CsgA expression levels in the double mutant UMR1 mltE mltC complemented with pMltE and pMltC .
The expression of MltE strongly increases the amount of CsgD and CsgA in the double mutant , while MltC expression leads to the minor upregulation of CsgD and CsgA .
The relative protein levels compared to that of S. Typhimurium UMR1 , which was set at 100 % , are indicated .
VC , vector control pBad30 .
The strains UMR1 csgD and UMR1 csgA were used as negative controls ( n.c. ) for CsgD and CsgA detection .

Catalytic activity of the transglycosylase SLT domain of MltE is required for rdar morphotype expression .
( A ) Morphotypes of UMR1 mltE mltC overexpressing pMltE or pMltE E64Q .

VC , vector control pBad30 .
Strains were grown on Congo red agar plates for 24 h at 28 °C .
( B ) Cell wall hydrolytic activity of lytic transglycosylases MltE and MltC .
SLT domains from MltE and MltC were partially purified and resolved on SDS - PAGE gel containing M. luteus cells as substrates for lytic transglycosylase activity .
The lytic transglycosylase activity of MltE was higher than the activity of MltC .
The MltE and MltC proteins containing mutations in the conserved glutamyl residues show only residual hydrolytic activity .
( C ) An SDS - PAGE gel stained with Coomassie blue as a loading control .
Lanes : 1 , MltE ; 2 , MltE E64Q ; 3 , MltC ; 4 , MltC E219Q ; and 5 , molecular mass standard ( in kDa ) .
To verify the effect of the E3Q mutations on catalytic activities of MltE and MltC , we overexpressed the SLT domains from these proteins as fusions to the maltose - binding protein , MBP .
The purified MBP - MltE Slt and MBP - MltC Slt proteins were used in a zymogram assay for the degradation of the PG - rich Micrococcus cell wall .
Wild - type MltE and MltC have PG hydrolytic activity , although the SLT domain of MltC proved to be much less active than the SLT domain of MltE in the zymogram assays .
The catalytic - site E3Q mutants of MltE and MltC had significantly reduced activities compared to the activities of the wild - type proteins , but their activities were not fully abolished ( Fig. 4B and C ) .
It is unclear whether the residual activities observed in the zymogram assays also are present in the full - length proteins in - vivo .
Taken together , however , these results demonstrate that the catalytic activities of MltE and MltC were responsible for the positive effect of these lytic transglycosylases on the rdar morphotype expression .
The stress sigma factors RpoS and OmpR are not involved in regulation of CsgD expression by lytic transglycosylases .
The stress sigma factor RpoS is required for CsgD expression ( 45 ) .
RpoS expression is regulated by a complex network involving a multitude of components and regulatory pathways .
We investigated whether RpoS expression is involved in CsgD downregulation in the mltE mltC double mutant .
The overexpression of RpoS from a plasmid did not restore rdar morphotype expression in the mltE mltC double mutant .
In addition , in strain MAE52 , CsgD expression is independent of RpoS due to a single point mutation in the csgD promoter resulting in semiconstitutive , temperature - independent CsgD and rdar morphotype expression ( 49 ) .
In the MAE52 mltE mltC double mutant , the rdar morphotype was downregulated when grown at 28 and 37 °C ( data not shown ) .
The csgD expression of the MAE52 mltE mltC double mutant was reduced to 59 % of that of MAE52 ( Fig. 3A ) , and CsgD protein levels were even more reduced ( data not shown ) .
Because a similar reduction was observed in the UMR1 background , where csgD expression is RpoS dependent , we conclude that CsgD regulation by MltE and MltC occurs independently of RpoS .
OmpR is another global transcriptional regulator required for csgD expression ( 45 ) .
The overexpression of OmpR did not restore the CsgD expression of the mltE mltC double mutant , suggesting that OmpR does not limit CsgD expression in the mltE mltC double mutant ( data not shown ) .
MltE and MltC do not work through the Rcs and Cpx two - component systems .
Two membrane - bound sensory systems monitor cell envelope stress .
The complex two - component system Rcs senses perturbations in the PG layer ( 33 ) , with the response regulator proteins RcsB and RcsA serving as the output ( 35 ) .
CpxR , the response regulator of the Cpx twocomponent surface - sensing system , suppresses CsgD expression and activates the expression of cell wall - degrading proteins ( 28 , 59 ) .
To investigate whether PG degradation by MltE and MltC is sensed through either of the two signaling systems , we expressed MltE and MltE E65Q in the respective response regulator mutants .
We also constructed response regulator mltE mltC triple mutants .
The upregulation of rdar morphotype expression was observed upon the overexpression of MltE in all response regulator mutants , i.e. , rcsA , rcsB , and cpxR mutants ( see Fig .
S1A in the supplemental material ; data not shown ) .
Further , the deletion of the response regulator genes in the mltE mltC background did not prevent rdar morphotype downregulation ( see Fig .
S1B ; data not shown ) .
Consequently , the regulation of the rdar morphotype by MltE and MltC occurs independently of the Rcs and Cpx two - component systems .
Interestingly , however , the expression of MltE E65Q in the rcsB mutant did not stimulate a mucoid phenotype ( i.e. , overproduction of colanic acid ) ( see Fig .
This finding demonstrates that a specific envelope stress signal was induced by the catalytically inactive MltE , but it was not induced by the active form of MltE .
c - di - GMP can partially compensate for the downregulation of rdar morphotype and CsgD expression in the mltE mltC deletion mutants .
The second messenger c - di - GMP is known to regulate rdar morphotype expression ( 29 , 47 ) .
We investigated whether c - di - GMP signaling is involved in rdar morphotype and CsgD expression through MltE and MltC .
Six proteins that affect the c - di - GMP metabolism in S. Typhimurium were described to be specifically involved in CsgD regulation .
Among them are the GGDEF - EAL domain diguanylate cyclase STM2123 and the EAL domain phosphodiesterase STM4264 ( 29 , 54 ) .
To investigate the effect of elevated c - di - GMP concentrations , we deleted the phosphodiesterase STM4264 or overexpressed the di - guanylate cyclase STM2123 , 6448 MONTEIRO ET AL. .
Effect of c - di - GMP signaling on the restoration of rdar morphotype expression in the UMR1 mltE mltC double mutant .
( A ) Deletion of STM4264 , encoding a c - di - GMP - dependent phosphodiesterase , in the mltE mltC double mutant upregulated rdar morphotype expression compared to that of the mltE mltC double mutant .
As previously shown ( 45 ) , the STM4264 mutant displayed an upregulated rdar morphotype compared to that of wild - type UMR1 .

The mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant shows an increase in CsgD levels compared to that of UMR1 mltE mltC , as CsgD expression increased in S. Typhimurium UMR1 compared to that of its STM4264 mutant .
The relative protein levels compared to that of S. Typhimurium UMR1 , which was set at 100 % , are indicated .

CsgD expression increased upon the expression of STM2123 in the wild - type UMR1 and the UMR1 mltE mltC mutant .
n.c. , negative - control MAE50 cogD .
For phenotype observation ( A and C ) , strains were grown on Congo red agar at 28 °C for 24 h. To detect CsgD expression ( B and D ) , wild - type UMR1 and mutants were grown on LB without NaCl agar at 28 °C for 17 h. which leads to elevated CsgD expression in wild - type S. Typhimurium UMR1 .
CsgD expression in the mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant was increased compared to that of the mltE mltC double mutant , but it did not reach the level of the STM4264 single mutant ( Fig. 5A and B ) .
Consistently with this result , CsgD expression was upregulated upon the overexpression of the diguanylate cyclase STM2123 in the mltE mltC mutant ( Fig. 5C and D ) .
We conclude that while higher intracellular c - di - GMP levels can partially compensate for the effect of MltE and MltC on rdar morphotype and CsgD expression , the effect of MltE and MltC is largely c - di - GMP independent .
Morphological characterization of mltE mltC mutants .
Lytic transglycosylases are responsible for the cleavage of the bacterial PG , which is essential for the separation of the daughter cells following cell division ( 19 ) .
Therefore , the deletion of such a general function might have pleiotropic effects .
However , we observed no difference in growth - rates between the wild type and the mltE mltC double mutant when these strains were grown in LB - medium at 37 °C ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , the double mutant showed severe morphological alteration , i.e. , the formation of long chains , when grown at 28 °C in LB without salt ( Fig. 6A ; also see Fig .
S2 in the supplemental material ) .
These chains of cells subsequently were analyzed by TEM , which revealed that chain formation is due to the impairment of the cleavage of the PG septum ( Fig. 6B ) .
The severity of the morphological alterations varied with growth - conditions .
When grown at 37 °C in LB - medium , the mltE mltC double mutant showed only a few longer cells but no extended chains ( data not shown ) .
The mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant , with an upregulated rdar morphotype ( due to higher intracellular c - di - GMP levels ) compared to that of the mltE mltC double mutant , also formed long chains at 28 °C in LB without salt medium ( Fig. 6A ) , while the STM4264 mutant looked like wild - type S. Typhimurium UMR1 .
As CsgD expression is upregulated in the mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant ( Fig. 6B ) , these results indicate that long - chain formation and rdar morphotype expression represent two uncoupled phenomena .
Longchain formation also was observed in E. coli when six murein FIG. 6 .

Note that no morphological alterations were detected for the mltE and mltC single mutants ( data not shown ) .
As another phenotype that can result from defective lytic transglycosylases , the integrity of the cell envelope was tested .
Increased cell membrane permeability leads to susceptibility to bile - acids .
The mltE mltC double mutant , respective single mutants , and the mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant were grown on MacConkey agar , which contains bile - salts .
The mltE mltC double mutant and the mltE mltC STM4264 triple mutant were unable to grow on MacConkey agar plates ( data not shown ) , showing that the deletion of these two lytic transglycosylases increases the permeability of the cell envelope .
S. Typhimurium , like other Gram - negative bacteria , is resistant to vancomycin , as the outer membrane is a barrier for this high - molecular - weight antibiotic .
However , resistance to vancomycin was not affected by the mltE mltC mutations ( data not shown ) , which demonstrates that membrane integrity is not entirely lost .
DISCUSSION In this study , we identified two lytic transglycosylases of family I , the catalytic activities of which specifically affect rdar morphotype expression ( biofilm formation ) in S. Typhimurium .
We established that these transglycosylases act upon the expression of CsgD , the key rdar morphotype transcription factor .
In total , we identified nine lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium .
In contrast to E. coli , which harbors five transglycosylases of family I ( 30 , 52 ) , in S. Typhimurium seven belong to family I , while MltA belongs to family II and MltB to family III .
This functional redundancy makes the assignment of specific functions complex .
In this work , we demonstrate that two lytic transglycosylases of family I , MltE and MltC , are specifically involved in the expression of the rdar morphotype .
MltE and MltC have different domain structures .
While MltE contains an SLT domain only , MltC contains an additional domain of unknown function , DUF3393 .
The SLT domains of MltE and MltC show closer similarity to each other than to other lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium .
MltE and MltC may be redundant with respect to the regulation of CsgD expression , i.e. , only the absence of both proteins has an effect on CsgD and rdar morphotype expression .
However , while MltE overexpression fully complemented the mltE mltC double mutant , MltC overexpression complemented it only partially .
This may be explained by significantly higher levels of MltE compared to those of MltC despite identical expression sequences .
An alternative is that the functions of MltC and MltE are complementary because MltE is believed to be an endo - acting transglycosylase ( 2 ) , whereas MltC is an exoenzyme ( 32 ) .
Ours is not the first report linking lytic transglycosylases ( also known as autolysins ) to biofilm formation .
For example , the mltE gene was found to promote biofilm formation in a recent screen of E. coli mutants ( 38 ) .
Furthermore , in firmicutes ( low - GC Gram - positive bacteria ) , interference with PG turnover alters surface adherence and biofilm formation ( 1 , 9 , 20 ) .
Several possibilities may be considered for how MltE and MltC affect CsgD expression .
First , activities of these lytic transglycosylases can be sensed in the cytoplasm via PG degradation products , anhydromuropeptide monomers , which are transported to the cytoplasm primarily by the permease AmpG ( 27 ) .
The deletion of AmpG , however , had no effect on rdar morphotype expression ( data not shown ) .
Similarly , the deletion of NagE and ManYZ transporters for PG degradation products such as GlcNac and glucosamine , as well as an ampG nagE manYZ triple mutant , had no effect on CsgD expression or rdar morphotype formation ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , cytosolic anhydromuropeptides or other PG degradation products do not seem to be involved in signaling to regulate CsgD expression .
Second , extracytoplasmic stress has been shown to downregulate CsgD expression and rdar morphotype ( 43 , 61 ) .
Anhydromuropeptide monomers or subsequent PG degradation products may initiate signaling in the periplasm .
However , neither the well - studied Rcs phosphorelay system , the major signaling pathway that senses perturbations in PG turnover ( 6 , 24 , 33 ) , nor the Cpx phosphorelay system was found to contribute to the downregulation of CsgD by MltE/MltC .
Consistently with this finding , susceptibility to selected - lactam antibiotics was not changed in the mltE mltC double mutant ( data not shown ) .
Overexpressed catalytically inactive MltE , however , is sensed through the Rcs phosphorelay system , leading to a mucoid phenotype .
It is feasible that MltE binding to its substrates without degradation causes periplasmic stress .
Alternatively , overexpressed , catalytically impaired MltE may interfere with other periplasmic proteins .
Third , altered membrane permeability may affect CsgD levels via an as - yet uncharacterized signaling pathway .
In E. coli , the deletion of six lytic transglycosylases has been shown to alter membrane permeability ( 19 ) .
In S. Typhimurium , the deletion of MltE and MltC was , under the growth - conditions used here , already sufficient to alter membrane permeability to some extent .
Consistent with the idea that altered membrane permeability affects rdar morphotype is the observation that in E. coli , the loss of outer membrane integrity due to the deletion of the Tol system resulted in the downregulation of the curlimediated biofilm ( 61 ) .
Also in line with this possibility is our observation that the periplasmic lipoprotein NlpI represses CsgD expression and rdar morphotype expression via an unknown mechanism ( 50 ) .
Fourth , the connection between MltE and MltC with CsgD and rdar morphotype expression can be a structural one , as lytic transglycosylases have a role in the assembly of macromolecular complexes ( 30 ) .
As we could not identify an already known regulatory pathway involved in the regulation of rdar morphotype expression by MltE and MltC , we screened for suppressor mutants of the mltE mltC double mutant phenotype by random transposon mutagenesis .
We identified suppressor mutants in STM2680 , STM2773 , and STM4363 which restored rdar morphotype expression to wild - type levels .
None of these genes is described to be involved in rdar morphotype and CsgD expression , suggesting that the lytic transglycosylases MltE and MltC regulate rdar morphotype and CsgD expression through a novel pathway .
In summary , the complex regulation of the rdar morphotype underscores the importance of the biofilm mode of growth .
For the first time , we uncovered a specific signaling role of two family I lytic transglycosylases in S. Typhimurium that commu - 6450 MONTEIRO ET AL. .
