Increasing numbers of examples describe how one two - component system ( TCS ) responds to signals detected by the sensor of another TCS .
However , the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly defined .
Results : Here , we report a connector - like factor that affects the activity of the CpxR/CpxA two - component system in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium .
We isolated a clone that induced the expression of a cpxP - lac gene fusion from a high - copy - number plasmid pool of random Salmonella genomic fragments .
A 63 - amino - acid protein , CacA , was responsible for the CpxA/CpxR - dependent activation of the cpxP gene .
The CpxR - activated genes cpxP and spy exhibited approximately 30 % and 50 % reductions in transcription , respectively , in a clean cacA deletion mutant strain in comparison to wild - type .
From 33 response regulator ( RR ) deletion mutants , we identified that the RssB regulator represses cacA transcription .
Substitution mutations in a conserved -10 region harboring the RNA polymerase recognition sequence , which is well conserved with a known RpoS -10 region consensus sequence , rendered the cacA promoter RpoS - independent .
The CacA - mediated induction of cpxP transcription was affected in a trxA deletion mutant , which encodes thioredoxin 1 , suggesting a role for cysteine thiol - disulfide exchange ( s ) in CacA - dependent Cpx activation .
Conclusions : We identified CacA as an activator of the CpxR/CpxA system in the plasmid clone .
We propose that CacA may integrate the regulatory status of RssB/RpoS into the CpxR/CpxA system .
Future investigations are necessary to thoroughly elucidate how CacA activates the CpxR/CpxA system .
Background The two - component system ( TCS ) is one of the most ubiquitous signal transduction systems in bacteria [ 1 ] .
A prototypical TCS harbors a sensor histidine kinase ( HK ) , which is often integrated into the inner membrane , and a response regulator ( RR ) , which is predominantly a cytoplasmic DNA - binding transcription factor .
In the presence of a specific activating signal , the sensor HK is autophosphorylated , and a phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to a conserved aspartate residue in its cognate RR , thus changing gene expression patterns and cell physiology .
Each TCS responds to specific environmental * Correspondence : Department of Advanced Bioscience , Graduate School of Agriculture , Kinki University , Nakamachi , Nara 631 -- 8505 - 3327 - 204 , Japan signals but elude identification even in the wellinvestigated organisms Escherichia coli and Salmonella .
Due to the high levels of sequence and structure similarity among different TCSs , cross - talk ( i.e. , phosphotransfer from a HK to its non - cognate RR ) may occur in at least some circumstances .
However , cross - talk is extremely rare due to the kinetic preference of a sensor HK for its cognate RR [ 2 ] and their phosphatase activities [ 3 ] .
To date , several small proteins connecting TCSs have been reported in Salmonella and E. coli [ 4,5 ] .
For example , the 85 - amino - acid PmrD protein , which is transcriptionally induced by the PhoP/PhoQ system under low Mg 2 + conditions , binds to the phosphorylated form of the regulator PmrA and hinders its dephosphorylation by the cognate sensor PmrB [ 6 ] .

The small anti - adapter proteins IraP and IraM , which promote the stability of the stationary - phase sigma S factor ( RpoS ) of RNA polymerase by hindering an RR ( RssB ) , are also transcriptionally activated by the PhoP/PhoQ system in response to low Mg 2 + conditions in Salmonella [ 8 ] and E. coli [ 9 ] , respectively .
In contrast to these cytosolic connectors , the small inner membrane proteins SafA ( B1500 ) [ 10 ] and MzrA [ 11 ] were identified as signal transducers between two TCSs by targeting downstream sensor HKs .
SafA elicits a response from the PhoQ sensor to the PhoP regulator even under high Mg 2 + conditions when the EvgS1 mutan protein [ 12 ] induces the EvgA - activated safA gene constitutively [ 10 ] .
Alternatively , MzrA interacts with the EnvZ sensor to control OmpR - regulated gene transcription when mzrA expression is induced in a constitutively activated CpxA * mutant background [ 13 ] in E. coli .
The membrane peptide MgrB [ 14,15 ] , which corresponds to a single TCS , communicates the activation status of the PhoP regulator to its cognate sensor PhoQ in E. coli and Salmonella [ 15 ] .
In contrast , the unique membrane peptide PmrR mediates the feedback control of the PmrA/PmrB system indirectly in Salmonella [ 16 ] .
The CpxR/CpxA system regulates pilus assembly , adherence , and biofilm development in response to envelope stress and is required for host cell invasion in several species , including pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella [ 17 ] .
The periplasmic chaperone CpxP binds to both the CpxA periplasmic domain and to certain misfolded proteins , which are degraded by the periplasmic protease DegP , therefore integrating information about their turnover status to the kinase activity of CpxA [ 18 - 20 ] .
The outer membrane lipoprotein NlpE activates the CpxA protein upon its overexpression [ 21 ] and is required for CpxA protein activation after adhering to hydrophobic surfaces [ 22 ] .
Additional upstream components have been proposed to integrate other stresses in a process that is independent of the CpxP and NlpE pathways [ 17,23 ] .
For example , the CpxR/CpxA system confers a copper resistance phenotype even in CpxP and NlpE mutants [ 24 ] .
Notably , nlpE ( cutF or STM0241 ) is a pseudogene in Salmonella [ 25 ] .
Here , we aimed to identify candidate connector genes that may integrate the signals of other systems .
We identified a small protein as a novel connector - like factor from screening high copy plasmid clones that could affect the CpxR/CpxA system status .
Results Identification of a plasmid clone that activates cpxP transcription To conduct a genetic screen for novel connector proteins acting on the CpxR/CpxA system , we constructed a strain harboring a cpxP - lac transcriptional - fusion in Salmonella .
The cpxP gene was chosen as a readout of the activation status of the CpxR/CpxA system because it is likely directly regulated exclusively by this system , unlike other CpxR - activated genes that are also controlled by envelope stress - responsive systems [ 26 - 28 ] .
The lacZY genes were inserted after the cpxP stop codon to ensure that the CpxP protein retained the ability to repress the CpxR/CpxA system .
Then , Salmonella chromosomal DNA was partially digested with Sau3AI and ligated with the high - copy - number plasmid pUC19 ( digested with BamHI ) to generate a DNA fragment library .
Of approximately 10,000 cpxP - lac Salmonella transformants , a plasmid clone termed pWN1 yielded stable blue colonies on LB plates containing 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3-indolyl - β-D - galactoside ( X - gal ) and ampicillin and was isolated four times .
The blue color of the pWN1 strain was due to elevated cpxP - lac fusion expression .
We demonstrated that this strain exhibit ~ 8 - fold higher β - galactosidase activity than the same strain harboring the vector control or the plasmid clone pUC19 - R1 that was randomly selected during the screening as a negative control ( Figure 1A ) .
Sequence analysis revealed that pWN1 harbors only the intact STM1852 open reading frame ( ORF ) , which appeared to encode a 63 - amino - acid protein with no homology to any protein of known function , as well as the 3 ' region of STM1851 and the 5 ' region of pphA ( Figure 1B ) .
Expression of STM1852 from tetracycline - ( Figure 1C ) or L - arabinose - ( Figure 1D ) inducible promoters recapitulated the increase in the β - galactosidase activity observed in the cpxP - lac strain , supporting the hypothesis that STM1852 was affecting cpxP transcription in the pWN1 plasmid .
Here , we named STM1852 `` Cpx activating connector - like factor - A '' , or CacA .
CacA - mediated cpxP activation is dependent on the CpxR/CpxA system The results described above demonstrated that cpxP transcription was induced when CacA was expressed from a high - copy - number plasmid or from a heterologous promoter in an inducer - dependent manner .
Next , we compared the β - galactosidase activities of the cpxPlac fusion from cpxR and cpxA mutant strains harboring pBAD18 - cacA to an isogenic cpxR + A + strain containing the same plasmid ( Figure 1D ) .
We determined that CacA acts upstream of the CpxR/CpxA system because the activities of the cpxR and cpxA mutant strains expressing CacA were comparable to that of the isogenic cpxR + A + strain with vector ( i.e. , pBAD18 ) alone ( Figure 1D ) .
This was further supported by the observation that another CpxR - activated gene , spy , was induced by CacA protein overexpression ( Figure 1C ) .
Moreover , CacA likely acts on the CpxR/CpxA system specifically Kato et al. .

BMC Microbiology 2012 , 12:224 Page 4 of 12 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/12/224 because expression of CacA did not affect genes under the direct control of other TCSs ( data not shown ) .
cacA transcription is activated by RpoS but repressed by RssB Next , we asked whether the cacA gene might be regulated by an undefined upstream TCS .
To examine candidate TCSs that could potentially affect cacA transcription , we constructed a strain with a cacA promoter - lac fusion 1 ( i.e. , P cacA - lac 1 ) at the pgtP locus on the Salmonella chromosome .
Then , 33 RR mutant stocks were independently transduced into the P cacA - lac 1 strain by phage P22 .
Whereas most RR mutants exerted minor or no effects on transcription from the cacA promoter ( data not shown , Figure 2A ) , the rssB mutant exhibited a ~ 1.5 - fold increase in cacA promoter activity ( Figure 2A ) .
Because RssB is the adaptor protein that recruits RpoS to the ClpXP protease , we examined the effect of a ΔrpoS mutant on transcription from the cacA promoter .
As expected , the rpoS gene was required for cacA expression ( Figures 2A and 2B ) .
Consistent with these observations , an alignment of the cacA promoter regions from Salmonella and its related enteric species revealed a conserved sequence that is present in an RpoS - dependent consensus -10 region sequence ( CTAcacT from -13 to -7 ) [ 29 ] ( Figure 3A ) .
Moreover , although the location of the predicted -10 region correlates well with a transcription start site ( TSS ) determined by a genome - scale precise mapping of TSSs that covered 78 % of the Salmonella ORFs [ 30 ] , no obvious typical -35 region sequence exists upstream of the -10 nucleotides ( Figure 3A ) .
We mutated this -10 sequence from TCCTACACT to TCGTACACT ( -14 C/G ) , ACGTACACT ( -16 T/A -14 C/G ) , or TCCTTCACA ( -12 A/T -8 T/A ) and analyzed their effects on cacA transcription ( Figures 3B and 3C ) .
In the ΔrpoS mutant , the β - galactosidase activity of the cacA promoter was approximately 1/3 of wild - type levels ( Figure 3C ) .
However , the β - galactosidase activities from the cacA promoter containing -14 C/G or -16 T/A -14 C/G substitutions were not affected by the ΔrpoS mutationafter4hofgrowthinLB , indicating that these substitution mutations rendered the cacA promoter RpoS - independent ( Figure 3C ) .
Conversely , when the essential nucleotides -12 A and -8 T of the canonical -10 region sequence , which permits recognition by both RpoD and RpoS , were mutated , cacA promoter activity was abolished independent of RpoS presence ( Figure 3C ) .
Taken together , these results demonstrated that the activation of the cacA promoter is dependent on the -10 region sequence , which harbors an RpoS recognition site .
Transcription of the CpxR - activated genes cpxP and spy is attenuated in a cacA mutant Because RpoS activates cacA expression , we assessed whether a cacA deletion mutation would affect transcription of the CpxA/CpxR - dependent cpxP and spy genes in low Mg 2 + , the conditions under which the PhoQ/PhoP - activated IraP prevents the RssB/ClpXPmediated degradation of RpoS , even at log phase [ 8 ] .
We determined that CacA participates in CpxA/CpxR system activation because cpxP and spy expression levels Figure 2 Transcription of the cacA gene is activated by RpoS but repressed by RssB .

Thioredoxin 1 is required for the CacA - mediated activation of the CpxR/CpxA system Pull - down experiment of the Glutathione S Transferase ( GST ) - CacA fusion protein recovered the GroEL and thioredoxin 1 ( TrxA ) proteins , suggesting that they interact directly with CacA ( data not shown ) .
Because GroEL has been shown to associate with proteins that are overexpressed , we did not investigate its role further .
Instead , we focused on the effect of TrxA on the CacAmediated activation of the CpxR/CpxA system because CacA orthologs contain four conserved cysteine residues ( Figure 4A ) and because TrxA catalyzes thiol disulfide redox reactions in a variety of substrate proteins [ 31 ] .
We investigated TrxC , another thioredoxin , and TrxB , which participates in the regeneration of reduced TrxA and TrxC [ 31 ] , as controls .
Whereas mutations in trxA , trxB , and trxC did not affect cpxP transcription in strains harboring vector alone , the trxA mutant expressing CacA significantly decreased the levels of cpxP transcription compared to wild - type expressing CacA ( Figure 4B ) .
These results indicate that TrxA is required for the CacA - mediated activation of the CpxR / Kato et al. .

Figure 5 A model for the regulatory interactions between RssB/RpoS and the CpxR/CpxA system .
RpoS accumulates during stationary phase and log phase , when the small anti - adopter protein IraP inhibits the RssB/ClpXP - mediated degradation of RpoS in low Mg 2 + conditions [ 8 ] .
RpoS induces expression of CacA , which stimulates the CpxR/CpxA system thus activating cpxP transcription .
TrxA functionally associates with CacA - mediated Cpx induction .

This suggests that cysteine thiol - disulfide exchanges participate in CacA - dependent Cpx activation .
Discussion We identified CacA , encoded on a plasmid clone , as a novel connector - like factor that activated the CpxR / CpxA system from screening a library of high - copynumber plasmids containing various Salmonella chromosomal DNA fragments .
CacA appears to exclusively act on the CpxR/CpxA system because a similar induction was not observed in other TCS reporter strains with the same clone .
This observation was not just an artifact of CacA overexpression or from its expression driven by a heterologous promoter because deleting this gene revealed a moderate decrease in transcription of the cpxP and spy genes , which are directly regulated by the CpxR/CpxA system .
Moreover , the activation of the cacA gene promoter is , at least in part , dependent on RpoS , the stability of which is subject to RssB/ClpXP - mediated processability and the -10 region sequence .
Taken together , we hypothesize that CacA may integrate information about the regulatory status of RssB/RpoS into the CpxR/CpxA system ( Figure 5 ) .
However , future investigations are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanism of CacA - mediated CpxR/CpxA activation .
Several assessments of how the CacA protein activates CpxR - regulated genes were attempted .
However , we did not detect a physical association between CacA and the CpxR/CpxA system .
For example , no significant interaction was observed between the CacA protein and the CpxR/CpxA system in our bacterial two - hybrid system analyses ( data not shown ) , although we can not completely dismiss that these proteins do not interact directly .
Instead , thioredoxin 1 amino - acid sequences were recovered by our pull - down assay .
trxA inactivation impacted the activation of the CpxR/CpxA system by CacA , which possesses the conserved cysteine residues .
This is in contrast to a report that demonstrated that a dsbD mutation activated the CpxR/CpxA system in Vibrio cholerae [ 32 ] , where the DsbC - DsbD pathway promotes proper folding of substrate proteins with disulfide bond ( s ) at the periplasm using the cytoplasmic reducing ability of thioredoxin [ 33 ] .
Moreover , the cysteine residues of NlpE are critical for activating the CpxR / CpxA system in E. coli [ 34 ] , and a periplasmic LolA derivative with an artificial disulfide bond activates the CpxR/CpxA system [ 35 ] .
Notably , perturbing the oxidizing environment of the periplasm in dsbA and dsbB mutants or treating wild - type cells with dithiothreitol ( DTT ) activated the PhoP/PhoQ system in E. coli [ 36 ] .
Disruption of disulfide bond formation affects this system largely via an additional small protein component , MgrB , and its conserved cysteine residues .
Currently , we can not exclude the possibility that the interaction between CacA and TrxA is an artifact CacA protein overexpression because TrxA interacts with many proteins , including the RR RcsB [ 37 ] .
Because we were unable to detect the 63 - amino - acid CacA protein at native levels , we employed a larger tag or carrier protein in several biochemical experiments , including the pull - down assay .
Protein instability likely precludes thorough analysis of small proteins of less than 50 amino acids or so [ 38 ] .
Notably , deletion of trxA did not impact cpxP transcription levels in normal growth - conditions ( e.g. , LB - medium ) .
More strict conditions need to be tested , as some small proteins accumulated within bacterial cells upon exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) [ 38 ] .
The specificity that TCS connectors exhibit for their targets is likely a key contributing factor in the fidelity of the integration of TCS signals at a post - translational level .
In fact , the PmrD connector protein can inhibit the dephosphorylation of phospho - PmrA but not of its closest homolog , the response regulator YgiX [ 6 ] .
Although recognizing novel connectors in genomic sequences based on their uniqueness is far from trivial , genetic approaches will continue to help elucidate links amongst TCSs .
Conclusions In this study , we identified the CacA protein as an activator of the CpxR/CpxA system .
This factor may be another example of an emerging class of small proteins [ 39 ] that function as nodes in the TCS network and function to integrate their signaling pathways in Salmonella .

Plasmid DNA was prepared from a pool of ~ 100,000 transformants and used to transform the strain AK1052 .
Transformants were serially diluted and spread onto LB plates containing ampicillin and 40 μg/ml X - gal to obtain 1,000 ~ 10,000 colonies per plate .
Plasmids were isolated from colonies that developed a blue color on LB plates containing ampicillin and X - gal .
These plasmids were reintroduced into AK1052 by electroporation , and four transformants were selected on LB plates containing ampicillin and X - gal .
A random single white colony from the same plate was also selected as a negative control .
