Golubeva 1 and James M. Slauch 1,2 * Department of Microbiology 1 and College of Medicine , 2 University of Illinois , Urbana , Illinois 61801 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium replicates within host macrophages during the systemic stage of infection .
In the macrophage , the bacteria must survive the respiratory burst that produces superoxide .
Serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 produces two periplasmic superoxide dismutases , SodCI and SodCII , but only SodCI contributes to virulence .
Although we have shown that this is primarily due to differences in the two proteins , evidence suggests differential regulation of the two genes .
Using transcriptional sodCI - and sodCII - lac fusions , we show that sodCII is under the control of the RpoS sigma factor , as was known for the Escherichia coli ortholog , sodC .
In contrast , we show that sodCI is transcriptionally controlled by the PhoPQ two - component regulatory system , which regulates an array of virulence genes required for macrophage survival .
Introduction of a phoP - null mutation into the sodCI fusion strain resulted in a decrease in transcription and loss of regulation .
The sodCI - lac fusion showed high - level expression in a background containing a phoQ constitutive allele .
The sodCI gene is induced 15 - fold in bacteria recovered from either the tissue culture macrophages or the spleens of infected mice .
Induction in macrophages is dependent on PhoP .
The sodCII fusion was induced three - to fourfold in macrophages and animals ; this induction was unaffected by loss of PhoP .
Thus , sodCI , which is horizontally transferred by the Gifsy - 2 phage , is regulated by PhoPQ such that it is induced at the appropriate time and place to combat phagocytic superoxide .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an enteric pathogenic bacterium capable of infecting and causing disease in humans and animals .
As an intracellular pathogen , serovar Typhimurium encounters a variety of host defense mechanisms and must adapt to different conditions within the host organism .
An important aspect of serovar Typhimurium pathogenesis is survival within host macrophages ( 12 ) , which is partly dependent on the ability of the bacterium to protect itself from the phagocytic respiratory burst that generates reactive oxygen species such as superoxide ( 7 , 11 ) .
Serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 produces two periplasmic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases , SodCI and SodCII .
SodCI is encoded on the functional lambdoid bacteriophage Gifsy - 2 , embedded within but transcribed in the opposite orientation to the late phage operon ( 10 , 13 , 22 ) .
SodCII is encoded on the chromosome and is the ortholog of Escherichia coli SodC .
Strains containing a sodCI - null mutation are attenuated in mouse time - to - death assays ( 7 , 11 ) .
In intraperitoneal competition assays against the isogenic wild - type strain , sodCI mutants show 7 - to 10 - fold attenuation ( 23 , 27 ) .
In contrast , sodCII - null mutations in strain 14028 do not confer a virulence phenotype , even in the absence of SodCI ( 27 , 45 ) .
Krishnakumar et al. ( 27 ) provided evidence that both SodCI and SodCII are expressed during infection and inherent differences in the two proteins primarily explain the differential role in virulence .
However , data also suggest that the two genes University of Illinois , B103 Chemical and Life Sciences Laboratory , 601 S. Goodwin Ave. , Urbana , IL 61801 .
Published ahead of print on 15 September 2006 .
Uzzau et al. ( 45 ) showed that epitope tagged SodCI accumulated to significantly higher levels than epitope tagged SodCII in bacteria recovered from macrophages and animals .
Eriksson et al. ( 9 ) noted transcriptional induction of sodCI but not sodCII in microarray analysis of serovar Typhimurium grown in tissue culture macrophages .
We noted that producing SodCII under the control of the sodCI promoter not only failed to complement a sodCI virulence defect but actually attenuated the bacterium further .
One explanation for this phenomenon was that the nonfunctional SodCII was being overproduced ( 27 ) .
A number of enzymes involved in defense to oxidative - stress are RpoS regulated , and E. coli sodC is a member of this regulon ( 15 ) .
Serovar Typhimurium sodCII was also shown to be controlled by RpoS ( 10 ) .
For sodCI , stationary - phase regulation had been reported , but it was apparently independent of RpoS ( 10 ) .
PhoPQ is a two - component regulatory system that is critical for serovar Typhimurium adaptation to intracellular growth ( 16 ) .
It consists of a sensor kinase , PhoQ , which phosphorylates PhoP , the response regulator .
PhoP then binds to the promoters of target genes resulting in activation or repression ( 14 , 17 , 35 , 53 ) .
In vitro , the system is activated by low cation concentrations ( 14 ) and low pH ( 3 ) .
However , more recent evidence suggests that low pH ( 31 ) and direct detection of antimicrobial peptides produced by macrophages ( 1 , 2 ) are the critical signals in the Salmonella - containing vacuole responsible for inducing PhoP phosphorylation .
Several PhoPQ - regulated genes encode regulatory proteins that directly or indirectly control expression of a subset of the PhoPQ regulon .
The PmrAB two - component regulatory system controls genes responsible for lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) 7853 7854 GOLUBEVA AND SLAUCH J. BACTERIOL .

modification and resistance to certain antimicrobial peptides ( 19 , 26 ) .
This system is induced by PhoPQ via pmrD ( 26 ) .
PmrAB can also be activated independently of PhoPQ by high - iron conditions or by mildly acidic pH ( 51 ) .
PhoPQ is also known to regulate rstAB , encoding a two - component system of unknown function ( 37 , 52 ) ; ssrAB , the two - component system that controls expression of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) type three secretion system ( 4 ) ; and slyA , which controls a large stress response regulon ( 38 , 39 , 41 ) .
We show here that sodCI and sodCII are differentially regulated .
The sodCI gene is regulated by the PhoPQ two - component regulatory system in - vitro and in - vivo .
In contrast , sodCII is under the control of RpoS .
Both genes are induced in bacteria recovered from tissue culture macrophages or the spleens of infected mice , with sodCI expressed at a higher level than sodCII .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth - conditions .
All Salmonella strains used in the present study are isogenic derivatives of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028 ( American Type Culture Collection ) and were constructed by using P22 HT105/1 int - 201 ( P22 ) - mediated transduction ( 30 ) .
Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium and modified N - minimal - medium ( 18 ) were used for the growth of bacteria .
Bacterial strains were grown at 37 °C except for the strains containing the temperature - sensitive plasmids pCP20 , pKD46 , and pINT - ts ( CRIM ) ( 6 , 20 ) , which were grown at 30 °C .
Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations : 100 g of ampicillin/ml , 20 g of chloramphenicol ( Cm ) / ml , 12.5 g of gentamicin/ml , 50 g of kanamycin/ml , 25 g of tetracycline/ml , and 50 g of apramycin/ml .
The - galactosidase chromogenic indicator X - Gal ( 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3 - indolyl - - D - galactopyranoside ) was used at a concentration of 80 g/ml .
Enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen or New England Biolabs and used according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
Primers were purchased from IDT , Inc. .
Deletion of various genes and concomitant insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette was carried out by using Lambda Red - mediated recombination ( 6 , 54 ) as described previously ( 8 ) .
The endpoints of each deletion are indicated in Table 1 .
The appropriate insertion of the antibiotic resistance marker was checked by VOL .
188 , 2006 REGULATION OF sodCI AND sodCII 7855 P22 linkage to known markers and/or PCR analysis .
In each case , the constructs resulting from this procedure were moved into a clean wild - type background ( strain 14028 ) by P22 transduction .
In some cases , antibiotic resistance cassettes were removed by using the temperature sensitive plasmid pCP20 carrying the FLP recombinase ( 5 ) .
Construction of the transcriptional lac fusions .
Transcriptional lac fusions were generated from the above constructs by using pCE70 ( 33 ) as described by Ellermeier et al. ( 8 ) .
The fusion joints are indicated in Table 1 .
In order to prevent the possible amplification of the fusion construct in the chromosome due to phage induction , with the resulting artifactual increase in lac activity , the sodCI fusion was made such that the Gifsy - 2 phage sequences downstream of sodCI were deleted through the attachment site ( see reference 22 ) .
To ensure that the strains were not attenuated in - vivo , the fusions were positioned immediately downstream of the sodCI and sodCII coding region .
The resulting fusion strains competed evenly with the wild - type strain in intraperitoneal competition assays performed in BALB/c mice ( data not shown ; see reference 22 ) .
- Galactosidase assays were performed by using a microtiter plate assay as previously described ( 43 ) on strains grown under the indicated conditions .
- Galactosidase activity units are defined as ( mol of orthonitrophenol [ ONP ] formed min 1 ) 10 6 / ( optical density at 600 nm [ OD 600 ] ml of cell suspension ) and are reported as mean the standard deviation where n 4 .
For log - phase cultures , bacteria were grown overnight in LB - medium , diluted 1/100 in the indicated medium and upon reaching an OD 600 of 0.2 , diluted 1/4 , and grown to OD 600 of 0.2 to 0.3 .
Strains were assayed at the same OD 600 .
- Galactosidase assays in bacteria recovered from infected macrophages .
RAW 264.7 macrophages ( American Type Culture Collection ) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % L - glutamine ( BioWhittaker ) .
Macrophages were seeded into six - well plates at 1 10 6 to 5 10 6 cells/well .
Bacteria were grown overnight in modified N - minimal - medium ( pH 5.6 ) supplemented with 10 M magnesium chloride .
Bacterial cells were washed with sterile phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and opsonized in 50 % mouse serum for 20 min at 37 °C .
Bacteria were then diluted in RPMI medium and used to infect macrophages at a multiplicity of infection of 20 .
After a 40 - min incubation period , the wells were washed twice with PBS and then RPMI medium containing 12.5 g of gentamicin/ml to kill extracellular bacteria was added to the wells .
After 20 min of additional incubation , the wells were washed once with PBS .
RPMI medium supplemented with 12.5 g of gentamicin/ml was added to the wells , and this was designated time zero .
After 16 h , the wells were washed twice with PBS and macrophages were lysed with 1 % Triton X - 100 .
The released bacteria were washed with PBS , and dilutions of each sample were plated on LB agar to determine the number of bacteria .
- Galactosidase activity was assayed by using the chemiluminescent substrate Lumigal 530 according to manufacturer 's instructions ( Lumigen , Inc. ) .
The - galactosidase activity of each sample was calculated per CFU of bacteria in a sample .
The in - vitro - galactosidase activity of bacteria grown in RPMI medium ( 16 h of growth ) was measured by using the same assay .
- Galactosidase assays in bacteria recovered from infected mouse splenic tissue .
BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with 10 4 cells of the sodCI - lac or sodCII - lac fusion strain .
After 4 days of infection , mice were sacrificed , and the spleens were homogenized to release the bacteria .
Bacterial cells were extracted from splenic tissue as described previously ( 42 ) .
he isolated bacteria were resuspended in PBS , and dilutions of each sample were plated on LB agar to determine the number of viable bacteria in a sample .
- Galactosidase activity was assayed using the chemiluminescent substrate Lumigal 530 according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Lumigen , Inc. ) .
The - galactosidase activity of each sample was calculated per CFU of bacteria in a sample .
The in - vitro - galactosidase activity of bacteria in the inoculum grown in LB - medium ( 16 h of growth ) was measured by using the same assay .
Bacterial cells were grown in LB - medium to an OD 600 of 1.0 , and the total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( QIAGEN RNEasy Mini ) .
Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase ( QIAGEN , Inc. ) was used to reverse transcribe the sodCI using extension primer sodCIext3 ( CCAGCTACCAGCGACAATATTGTG ) .
The primer was radioactively labeled with [ - 32 P ] ATP by using Optikinase ( USB Corp. ) .
A DNA fragment of 400 bp corresponding to the sequence immediately upstream of sodCI coding region was amplified by PCR using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase ( Invitrogen , Inc. ) .
The resulting PCR product was used to generate a sequence ladder with the same primer that was used for the extension reaction .
The extension product was resolved on an 8 % polyacrylamide -- 7 M urea gel alongside the sequence ladders .
The Sequenase 2.0 kit used for the sequencing reactions , polyacrylamide gel mix , and GTG running buffer were purchased from the USB Corp. .
Deletion analysis of the sodCI promoter .
The sodCI promoter was analyzed by amplifying and cloning portions of the promoter region 5 to a promoterless lacZ gene in pDX1 , an apramycin - resistant plasmid derived from pAH125 ( 20 ; D. Lin and J. M. Slauch , unpublished data ) .
All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis .
The resulting fusion plasmids were integrated into the serovar Typhimurium chromosome at the Lambda attachment site using Int produced from CRIM helper plasmid pINT - ts ( 20 ) .
Each integrant was tested by PCR to ensure that only a single copy of the plasmid was present ( 20 ) .
RESULTS The sodCI and sodCII genes are transcriptionally induced in stationary - phase .
Previous studies ( 27 , 45 ) have shown that SodCI , but not SodCII , contributes to serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 virulence in mice .
These studies also suggested that sodCI is expressed at a higher level than sodCII in - vivo , although our results ( 27 ) indicated that sodCII is expressed during infection .
Both enzymes are produced in laboratory culture ( 27 , 45 ) and induced in the stationary - phase of growth ( 10 , 27 ) .
We used single - copy chromosomal transcriptional lac fusions to sodCI and sodCII to study the expression of both genes in - vitro and in - vivo .
We constructed our fusions by inserting promoterless lacZY genes ( 8 ) just downstream of the sodCI or sodCII stop codons .
In the case of sodCI , this insertion is associated with a deletion of all Gifsy - 2 phage genes downstream of sodCI through attL , including int , the immunity region , and the genes encoding the putative replication proteins .
This ensured that phage induction did not artifactually increase lac activity .
Thus , both fusion constructs produced SodCI or SodCII equivalent to that produced by the wild type ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , the strain containing the sodCI - lac fusion and the associated deletion of the Gifsy - 2 phage genes was fully virulent ( data not shown ) , which is consistent with our previous data showing that the phage genes are not required for virulence and that SodCI is produced from the lysogenic phage ( 22 ) .
To analyze expression , we first determined the - galactosidase activity produced from the sodCI - lac and sodCII - lac fusion strains in different stages of growth in LB - medium .
Figure 1 shows that sodCI and sodCII genes are induced 3.75 - and 5.3 - fold in stationary - phase , respectively .
Genes that are induced in the stationary - phase are often under the control of RpoS ( 21 ) .
Indeed , E. coli sodC ( the sodCII ortholog ) is known to be regulated by RpoS ( 15 ) .
Introduction of an rpoS deletion mutation into the fusion - bearing strains resulted in the decreased expression of sodCII .
In contrast , sodCI expression was not affected by the loss of RpoS .
These data are in agreement with the previous results of Fang et al. ( 10 ) .
The enzymatic activity of SodCI and SodCII in wild - type ( wt ) and rpoS backgrounds in - vitro correlated with the lac fusion results ( data not shown ) .
These results show that sodCII is regulated by RpoS in vitro .
In contrast , sodCI expression in - vitro is apparently under the control of some other regulator .
Expression of sodCI is controlled by PhoPQ in - vitro .
Microarray analysis suggested that sodCI was a member of the PhoPQ two - component regulon ( 38 ) .
To examine whether sodCI was under the control of PhoPQ in - vitro , we monitored the expression of the sodCI - lac fusion in modified N - minimal medium ( pH 5.6 ) , supplemented with 10 mM or 10 M MgCl 2 ; divalent cations serve as a signal for the PhoPQ system in - vitro ( 2 , 14 , 40 ) .
As shown in Fig. 2 , sodCI was induced twofold in 7856 GOLUBEVA AND SLAUCH J. BACTERIOL .

Introduction of a phoP - null mutation abolished this induction .
Introduction of the phoQ24 allele ( 25 , 36 , 49 ) resulted in high - level constitutive expression of sodCI .
The expression of the sodCII - lac fusion was analyzed under the same conditions .
In contrast to sodCI , the expression of the sodCII was not significantly affected by either the concentration of magnesium or introduction of the phoP or phoQ24 mutations ( Fig. 2 ) .
These results indicate that sodCI is regulated by the PhoPQ two - component regulatory system in vitro , whereas sodCII is not .
Transcription of sodCI is induced 10 - to 15 - fold in tissue culture macrophages and in mice .
Both sodCI and sodCII are expressed in the host ( 27 ) , but several previous studies suggested that sodCI is expressed at a higher level than sodCII ( 9 , 27 , 45 ) .
In order to study the in - vivo expression of both genes , the strains bearing sodCI - and sodCII - transcriptional lac FIG. 2 .

In vivo expression of sodCI and sodCII .
( A ) Expression of the sodCI - lac and sodCII - lac fusions in cells recovered from RAW 264.7 macrophages or grown in RPMI medium .
Expression of sodCI in macrophages was considered 100 % .
( B ) Expression of the sodCI - lac and sodCII - lac fusions in cells isolated from BALB/c mice or grown in LB - medium .
Expression of sodCI in BALB/c mice was considered 100 % .
- Galactosidase activity was determined by using a chemiluminescence assay .
fusions were used to infect RAW 264.7 macrophages .
The - galactosidase activity of bacteria isolated from macrophages was compared to that of bacteria grown in a laboratory culture .
As seen in Fig. 3A , expression of sodCI was 10 - fold induced in macrophages , whereas sodCII expression was induced 4 - fold .
To study the expression levels of both genes during infection , BALB/c mice were infected with sodCI or sodCII fusion strains , and bacteria were isolated from the spleen after 4 days of infection .
The - galactosidase activities of the bacteria isolated from mice and those grown in laboratory medium are shown in Fig. 3B .
Strikingly similar to our macrophage expression data , sodCI was induced 15 - fold in BALB/c mice compared to the laboratory culture , whereas sodCII was induced 3.5 - fold .
This correlation between the tissue culture macrophage and mouse data is consistent with the concept that the majority of bacteria are found within macrophages in the host ( 29 ) .
These data also suggest that our macrophage experiments are relevant for the study of the in - vivo regulation of sodCI and sodCII .
PhoPQ regulates sodCI in - vivo .
To test whether PhoPQ is responsible for sodCI induction in - vivo , RAW 264.7 macrophages were infected with strains harboring the sodCI - or sodCII - transcriptional - fusions in wt , phoP , orphoQ24 backgrounds .
As above , expression of sodCI was induced 15 - fold in macrophages ( Fig. 4A ) .
This induction was completely dependent on PhoP ; introduction of the phoP - null mutation abolished sodCI expression in macrophages .
Expression of sodCI was elevated 3 - fold in tissue culture medium in the phoQ24 background compared to the wild type , and expression was induced an additional 22 - fold in macrophages .
This is likely due to the effect of lowering pH on the activation of the PhoQ24 protein ; a similar effect was seen in - vitro when we compared growth media at pH 7.4 versus pH 5.6 ( data not shown ) .
The sodCII fusion was induced two - to threefold in macrophages , and this induction was not affected in the presence of the phoP - null or phoQ24 mutations ( Fig. 4A ) .
These experiments are potentially complicated by the reduced viabil - VOL .

Effect of regulatory mutations on sodCI and sodCII expression in - vivo .
The activity of sodCI - and sodCII - lac fusions in phoP : : Tn10dCm and phoQ24 backgrounds ( A ) or an rpoS background ( B ) is presented .
After 16 h of incubation , the - galactosidase activity of the bacteria released from macrophages , and those grown in RPMI medium were determined by using the chemiluminescence assay .
Expression of sodCI in a wt background in macrophages is considered 100 % .
Expression of sodCI is unaffected by mutations in PhoPdependent regulatory systems .

The PmrA - regulated gene , pmrI , was monitored as a control .
( B ) Effect of rstA : : Cm and ssrB : : Cm mutations on the expression of sodCI .
All strains were grown in N - min modified medium ( pH 5.6 ) supplemented with 10 M or 10 mM magnesium chloride ( inducing and repressing conditions , respectively ) to an OD 600 of 0.3 .
- Galactosidase activity units are defined as ( mol of ONP formed min 1 ) 10 6 / ( OD 600 ml of cell suspension ) and are reported as means the standard deviation ( n 4 ) .
ity of the phoP and phoQ mutants in macrophages ( 12 , 35 , 36 ) .
Indeed , we recovered approximately 3 - to 10 - fold less phoP or phoQ24 mutant compared to wild - type cells after 16 h of incubation .
However , the fact that the specific activity of the sodCII fusion was not affected in the pho mutants shows that any survival defect was irrelevant to these measurements .
These results show that PhoPQ regulates sodCI expression in vivo but does not affect sodCII expression , which correlates well with our in - vitro data .
In vitro , sodCII is primarily under the control of RpoS .
We therefore tested the effect of an rpoS - null mutation on sodCII and sodCI expression in macrophages .
As described above , sodCII was induced almost fourfold in bacteria recovered from macrophages compared to those propagated in tissue culture medium ( Fig. 4B ) .
The loss of RpoS abrogated sodCII induction .
In contrast , sodCI expression was unaffected .
Although not significant in this experiment , there might be residual RpoS - independent induction of sodCII , which again would be consistent with our in - vitro data .
PhoPQ regulation of sodCI is apparently direct .
PhoPQ is known to activate a number of regulatory systems : PmrAB , SlyA , SsrAB , and RstAB ( 4 , 26 , 37 -- 39 , 41 , 52 ) .
It is possible that sodCI is not directly regulated by PhoP but rather indirectly via one of these systems .
In order to test this hypothesis , we inactivated these systems in both the wild - type and the phoQ24 backgrounds and assayed the resulting - galactosidase activity from the sodCI - lac fusion .
Navarre et al. ( 38 ) previously concluded that sodCI was not under the control of SlyA .
Our data show that the expression of sodCI is not affected by the deletion of pmrA , ssrB , orrstA in either the wild - type or the phoQ24 background ( Fig. 5 ) .
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PhoP directly activates sodCI expression .
Analysis of the sodCI promoter region .
To precisely map the sodCI promoter , we used primer - extension analysis ( Fig. 6 ) .
The results revealed that the transcription start site of sodCI is 61 bp upstream of the ATG start codon .
To find the promoter region that is necessary for PhoP activation , we cloned various fragments of the sodCI promoter 5 to a promoterless lacZ gene in pDX1 , an apramycin - resistant plasmid derived from pAH125 ( 20 ; Lin and Slauch , unpublished ) .
These constructs were integrated into the chromosome at the Lambda attachment site in both wild - type and phoQ24 backgrounds .

Mapping of the transcription start site of sodCI by primer extension .
The phoQ24 mutant cells were grown in LB - medium to an OD 600 of 1.0 for isolation of total RNA .
The transcription start site on the corresponding sequence is underlined .
results shown in Fig. 7 indicate that the smallest fragment that was cloned , corresponding to positions 42 to 12 of the sodCI promoter ( fragment C ) , conferred regulation in response the phoQ24 allele .
The fragment corresponding to positions 98 to 29 was not significantly regulated and serves as a negative control .
Analyses of a series of PhoP - regulated promoters suggests a consensus sequence for PhoP binding : two ( G/T ) GTTTA ( A/T ) direct repeats separated by 4 bp ( 28 , 37 , 44 , 55 ) .
In a significant subset of PhoP activated promoters , this binding site overlaps the 35 promoter sequence ( 55 ) .
A similar sequence is noted at the appropriate location in the sodCI promoter from 42 to 25 ( Fig. 8 ) .
To test the relevance of this sequence , we altered specific base pairs in the context of the fragment from 42 to 12 .
Any change to this consensus sequence significantly affected activation in the phoQ24 background .
The most striking example is fragment H ( Fig. 8 ) , in which three base pair changes , corresponding to sites shown to be critical for PhoP activation of the mgtA promoter in E. coli ( 53 ) , completely abrogated the transcriptional activation in the phoQ24 background .
These results show that the fragment from 42 to 12 contains all of the sequence required for PhoP activation and suggest that the identified consensus PhoP - binding site is critical for this activation .
The data presented above identify a putative PhoP binding site .
Together with the fact that known PhoP - regulated transcriptional activators are apparently not involved in sodCI regulation , these results suggest that PhoP acts directly at the sodCI promoter .
However , our attempts to gel shift sodCI promoter fragments by using purified His - tagged PhoP under a variety of conditions were inconclusive ( not shown ) .
Zwir et al. ( 55 ) recently combined bioinformatics and gene expression analysis to identify members of the PhoP regulon .
These authors used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to confirm PhoP binding to designated sites .
E. A. Groisman tested whether PhoP was cross - linked to the sodCI promoter in his assay ( unpublished data ) .
Using primers that amplify a 276 - bp fragment centered on the putative PhoP site , the results ( not shown ) suggested that PhoP did not bind to this region under the in - vitro inducing conditions .
Thus , although our genetic data strongly argue that PhoP directly activates sodCI transcription , we have been unable to confirm direct binding using in - vitro molecular techniques .
There are two possible explanations for these inconclusive results .
Perhaps there is an additional unidentified regulator that is controlled by PhoP and FIG. 7 .

directly acts at the sodCI promoter .
If so , then this regulator apparently binds to a site that is strikingly similar to that recognized by PhoP .
Alternatively , PhoP binding to the nonconsensus sodCI site is weak and is only realized under the in vivo induced conditions .
Indeed , the induction of sodCI in - vivo is far greater than what is achievable in - vitro under any condition that we tested ( Fig. 3 and 4 ) .
At the moment , we favor the latter interpretation .
DISCUSSION Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 produces two periplasmic superoxide dismutases , SodCI and SodCII .
Although both proteins are produced during infection ( 27 ) , only SodCI contributes to virulence .
Although this inequality in roles is mostly due to some difference in the two proteins , several lines of evidence suggested that the two genes were differentially regulated in the host ( 9 , 27 , 38 , 45 ) .
Here we show that sodCI , encoded on the Gifsy - 2 bacteriophage , is a member of the PhoPQ regulon .
As such , it is transcriptionally induced in the Salmonella - containing vacuole of the macrophage , ideally expressed to combat phagocytic superoxide known to be important in controlling Salmonella infection ( 7 , 32 , 46 -- 48 ) .
The PhoPQ regulon includes a large number of genes whose products contribute to macrophage survival by conferring , for example , resistance to antimicrobial peptides and low pH ( 16 , 55 ) .
PhoP also contributes to activation of the SPI - 2 type three secretion system required for establishment of the so - called Salmonella - containing vacuole in which the bacteria replicate ( 4 ) .
We now add resistance to phagocytic superoxide to the PhoP repertoire of intracellular survival functions , further emphasizing the central importance of this regulon .
In vitro , the PhoPQ system is induced in media with a low concentration of divalent cations , including Mg and Ca ( 16 ) , and the regulon includes Mg transporters apparently required to adapt to the low - Mg environment .
However , recent data suggest that Mg may not be the dominant signal that activates the system in the macrophage .
Rather , a low pH seems critical ( 31 ) .
Also , it has been shown that PhoQ can respond to sublethal concentrations of antimicrobial peptides , a signal that is also likely to be important in - vivo ( 1 , 2 ) .
The PhoPQ regulon , partially via the PmrAB system , is responsible for resistance to these peptide antibiotics .
Our data are consistent with these observations .
In N - minimal - medium , even at pH 5.6 , lowering the Mg concentration induced sodCI only two - to threefold .
In contrast , the gene was induced 15 - fold in macrophages and in the animal .
Induction was even more dramatic in the strain producing the PhoQ24 protein , which does not respond to Mg at pH 5.6 ( Fig. 2 ) .
All of the known PhoP regulon members involved in virulence were apparently acquired by horizontal gene transfer ( 16 , 55 ) .
SodCI is expressed from the lysogenic Gifsy - 2 phage .
The phage encodes a number of potential virulence - factors , including SseI , which is under the transcriptional control of SsrAB ( 50 ) and is secreted by the SPI2 type three secretion system ( 34 ) , and GtgE , a putative cytoplasmic protein of unknown function with no known homologs .
( See reference 22 for a more complete analysis of Gifsy - 2 .
) Mutations in only sodCI and gtgE confer a phenotype in the mouse model of infection , together accounting for essentially all of the 150 - fold de - 7860 GOLUBEVA AND SLAUCH J. BACTERIOL .
crease in virulence seen in a strain cured of Gifsy - 2 phage ( 22 ) .
We know that both sodCI and gtgE are expressed from the lysogen and that phage induction is not required , because strains containing deletions of Gifsy - 2 that block excision , immunity , late gene transcription , and replication , but which leave sodCI and gtgE intact , are fully virulent ( 22 ) .
Indeed , studies here were performed with strains deleted for all phage genes downstream of sodCI , analogous to the deletion mentioned above .
In the phage , the sodCI open reading frame and downstream ailT gene are inserted between the open reading frames for the minor tail proteins M and L .
In Lambda , the stop codon for M overlaps the start codon for L , as is common for genes in the late operon .
Presumably , sodCI evolved to be regulated by PhoPQ after it was acquired by the Gifsy - 2 phage .
Indeed , the start codon for the Gifsy - 2 L gene is at position 30 in the sodCI promoter and much of the putative PhoP binding site is within the L open reading frame ( Fig. 8 ) .
Interestingly , eight of the first nine amino - acids of Gifsy - 2 L ( corresponding to 23 of the first 27 nucleotides ) are identical to those of Lambda L and a subset of other lambdoid phage L proteins .
This conservation of amino - acids is certainly not the rule among the lambdoid phages , and many of the genes in the late operon show no direct homology to Lambda , although the overall layout of genes and , presumably , function are conserved .
Thus , this conservation suggests that the N terminus of L is important .
One of the base pairs that differs from Lambda , leading to an amino acid change from Arg to Pro in the sequence , corresponds to the first conserved G in the upstream PhoP half site .
Although the overall PhoP binding site differs from consensus , this must be viewed in the context of the L open reading frame .
For example , the ( G/T ) G in the downstream PhoP half site in the sodCI promoter is not conserved , but these nucleotides correspond to the ATG start codon for L ( Fig. 8 ) .
Thus , the phage presumably evolved to regulate the acquired sodCI gene via PhoP while maintaining the amino - acid sequence critical for L function .
Given these constraints , sodCI has apparently evolved an imperfect PhoP binding site .
Indeed , although a few members of the PhoPQ regulon , such as phoPQ , mgtA , and slyB , possess consensus or near consensus binding sites , many members of the regulon do not ( 28 , 55 ) .
Binding has also been observed at imperfect sites in the pmrD and pcgL promoters ( 28 ) .
In other cases , however , binding has not been shown in - vitro , although partial sites are apparent .
We have been unable to prove direct binding of PhoP to the sodCI promoter in - vitro .
Given the strong induction in - vivo versus that obtainable in - vitro , it is possible that PhoP , appropriately activated in the phagosome and itself increased in production , is capable of binding these imperfect sites and directly activating expression of this entire repertoire of genes , which is important for survival in this hostile environment .
