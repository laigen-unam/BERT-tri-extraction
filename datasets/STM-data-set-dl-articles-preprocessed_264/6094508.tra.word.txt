160 , No. 3 Regulation of Expression of the ilvB Operon in Salmonella typhimurium ROBIN A. WEINBERGt * AND R. 0 .
BURNS Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Duke University Medical Center , Durham , North Carolina 27710 The ilvB gene of Salmonella typhimurium encodes the valine - sensitive form of acetohydroxy - acid synthase , acetohydroxy - acid synthase I , which catalyzes the first step in the parallel biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine .
Although nearly all of the other genes involved in this pathway are clustered at minute 83 , ilvB was found to lie at minute 80.5 .
Expression of ilvB was shown to be nearly completely repressed by the end products leucine and valine .
Studies in which we used strains with mutations in cya ( adenylate cyclase ) and crp ( cAMP receptor protein ) demonstrated that synthesis of acetohydroxy - acid synthase I is enhanced by the cAMP - cAMP receptor protein complex .
Although no stimulation was achieved by growth on poor carbon sources , introduction of crp on a multicopy plasmid led to markedly increased expression .
Strains of S. typhimurium lacking valine - resistant acetohydroxy - acid synthase II ( ilvG ) are like Escherichia coli K - 12 in that they are not able to grow in the presence of L - valine owing to a conditional isoleucine auxotrophy .
The valine toxicity of these ilvG mutants of S. typhimurium was overcome by increasing the level of acetohydroxy - acid synthase I. Enzyme activity could be elevated either by maximally derepressing expression with severe leucine limitation , by introduction of either ilvB or crp on a multicopy plasmid , or by the presence of the ilv - 513 mutation .
This mutation , which is closely linked to genes encoding the phosphoenol pyruvate : sugar phosphotransferase system ( pts ) , causes highly elevated expression of ilvB that is refractory to repression by leucine and valine , as is the major ilv operon .
The response of ilvB to the cAMP - cAMP receptor protein complex was not affected by this lesion .
Data obtained by using this mutant led us to propose that the two modes of regulation act independently .
We also present some evidence which suggests that ilvB expression may be affected by the phosphoenol pyruvate : sugar phosphotransferase system .
The ilvB gene of Salmonella typhimurium specifies one of the isozymes of acetohydroxy - acid synthase ( AHAS ) , AHAS I , which catalyzes the first step in parallel pathways leading to the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine .
Although much work has been done to elucidate the mechanism of regulation of this gene in Escherichia coli K - 12 , less information is available concerning its expression in S. typhimurium .
Therefore , we carried out studies to determine the mode of regulation of this gene in S. typhimurium based on the information available from studies done on E. coli .
At least three factors have been described that influence the level of AHAS I activity in cells .
First , in both E. coli and S. typhimurium , the enzyme is subject to feedback inhibition by valine ( 2 , 29 ) .
Second , enzyme synthesis in both species is repressed by leucine and valine ( 15 , 40 ) ; sequence data from E. coli demonstrate that this repression is mediated by attenuation ( 18 , 21 ) .
Third , the synthesis of AHAS I in E. ccli is stimulated by elevated levels of cAMP associated with the cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) ( 46 ) .
This mode of regulation is highly unusual for an enzyme that is apparently only involved in biosynithesis .
In this paper we present results obtained with strains of S. typhimurium that have mutations affecting the synthesis of cAMP ( cya ) or the receptor protein ( crp ) which indicate that a similar form of regulation exists in this species .
Strains of S. typhimurium that are mutated in ilvG and therefore express only the valine - sensitive isozyme of acetohydroxy acid synthase , AHAS I , are analogous to E. coli K - 12 in that they are not able to grow on valine - containing * t Present address : Department of Biochemistry , State University of New York at Stony Brook , Stony Brook , NY 11794 .
The valine present inhibits the formation of the isoleucine precursor ot - aceto - a-hydroxybutyrate , and thus the cells are starved for isoleucine ( 40 ) .
We found that valine toxicity of these ilvG mutants can be overcome by raising the level of AHAS I .
A similar finding has not been reported for E. coli K - 12 .
We also describe a mutant which lacks valineinsensitive A14AS II but is able to grow in the presence of high concentrations of valine .
Expression of AHAS I in this strain is elevated and refractory to repression by leucine and valine , as is the major ilv operon .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and culture media .
All of the strains used in this study are derivatives of S. typhimurium LT - 2 ( Table 1 ) .
All of the plasmids are derivatives of pBR322 .
The minimal - medium used was that of Davis and Mingioli ( 13 ) modified by omitting the citrate and raising the glucose concentration to 0.5 % ( wt/vol ) .
Solid medium was prepared by adding 1.5 % ( wt/vol ) agar ( Difco Laboratories ) .
The concentrations of potassium phosphate and ammonium sulfate were doubled to increase the buffering capacity of the mediutn when cultures were used for preparation of cell extracts .
The minimal - medium used for growth of ilvG mutants was supplemented with 20 mg of calcium pantothenate per liter ( 42 ) .
Indicator plates containing nutrient agar ( Difco ) , 1 g of NaCl per liter , 0.2 % glycerol , 0.2 % rhamnose , and 50 mg of 2,3,5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride per liter were used in the detection of adenylate cyclase ( cya ) and CRP ( crp ) mutants ( 36 ) .
P22 - mediated transduction was performed by the method described by Margolin ( 34 ) , except that the HT105/4 mutant derived by Schmieger ( 44 ) was used .

Genetic map location of ilvB .
To obtain a TnlO transposon closely linked to a gene of interest , the method of Davis et al. ( 14 ) was used .
Tetracycline - sensitive derivatives were isolated by the ampicillin selection procedure described by Kleckner et al ( 27 ) .
Bacterial conjugation and isolation of F ' ilvB factors .
The conjugation protocol described by Miller ( 36 ) was used .
When isolating F ' strains from Hfr strains , we used a recA recipient ( 31 ) .
F ' ilvB transconjugants were tested for sensitivity to phage MS2 ( 36 ) and loss of ilvB by growth under nonselective conditions or by treatment with acridine orange ( 23 ) .
Preparation of cell extracts for enzyme assays .
Cells were routinely grown as 250 - ml batch cultures at 37 Â°C with aeration .
Cells in mid - log phase were disrupted by sonic oscillation .
Extracts were prepared as previously described , except that pyridoxal phosphate was omitted from the resuspension buffer ( 4 ) .
Assays for the following enzymes were performed as previously described : threonine deaminase ( 7 ) , transaminase B ( 17 ) , AHAS ( 45 ) , , - isopropylmalate dehydrogenase ( 41 ) , homoserine dehydrogenase ( 12 ) , and histidinol phosphate phosphatase ( 35 ) .
Valine at a concentration of 1 mM was added to the AHAS assay to distinguish the valine - insensitive fraction of the enzyme ( AHAS II ) from the total AHAS activity detected ( 2 ) .
All specific activities were expressed as nanomoles of product formed per minute per milligram of protein .
Protein concentration was measured by the method of Lowry et al. ( 32 ) .
Strains of S. typhimurium were transformed by the procedure of Lederberg and Cohen ( 30 ) .
All plasmid constructions were done in E. coli K - 12 .
These strains were transformed by the method of Mandel and Higa ( 33 ) .
Plasmids were transferred to an hsdR mutant of S. typhimurium , mutant DU7 ( 6 ) , prior to transformation of other strains of S. typhimurium .
This step increased the frequency of transformants by lowering the loss of plasmid DNA by the action of the restriction system of S. typhimurium on DNA prepared from a heterologous host .
The F ' plasmid DNA was isolated by the method of Hansen and Olsen ( 20 ) .
All digestions were performed by the method of Davis et al. ( 14 ) .
ilvB plasmid pDU101 was constructed from an HindIII ( Bethesda Research Laboratories ) digest of F ' pDU640 and was cloned into pBR322 by using T4 DNA ligase ( Bethesda Research Laboratories ) ( 47 ) .
The original ilvB clone was subcloned by using EcoRI and HindIII .
Plasmid pDU111 was constructed by digesting both pHA7 and pDU101 with EcoRI , mixing the two , and ligating ( see Fig. 3 ) .
The ligation mixture was used to transform an ilvG ilvB double mutant , DU2603 .
Transformants were selected on minimal - medium supplemented with 1 g of valine per liter and ampicillin .
Plasmid DNAs were prepared from transformants and digested with EcoRI and HindIII to determine whether they contained all of the ilvB information from pDU1l1 , as well as all of pHA7 .
One such plasmid was isolated , pDU111 .
Plasmid DNA was purified by the rapid alkaline lysis method of Birnboim and Doly ( 3 ) as modified by Ish - Horowicz and Burke ( 25 ) for most manipulations .
When plasmid DNA was used for construction of recombinants , it was isolated by separating the plasmid DNA on a cesium chloride gradient as described by Humphreys et al. ( 24 ) .
Most amino - acids , sugars , and antibiotics were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. , - Isopropylmalate was prepared by the method of Calvo and Gross ( 8 ) .
Technical grade cesium chloride was purchased from Kawecki Chemicals .
RESULTS Mapping of ilvB .
Strain DU2616 lacking AHAS activity ( ilvG ilvB ) was isolated following nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis ( 36 ) of ilvG mutant DU12 .
This strain was then used in mating experiments to locate ilvB .
Matings with F ' plasmid pDU540 having a mutation in ilvG ( D. L. Blazey , R. Kim , and R. 0 .
1978 , 1453 , p. 112 ) that extended from rrnC ( minute 82.5 ) through metE ( minute 84 ) yielded no valine - sensitive prototrophs , demonstrating that ilvB was not contiguous with the major ilv gene cluster ( 43 ) .
Two F ' plasmids were isolated that did not contain ilvG but did complement the mutant lacking AHAS activity .
F ' plasmid pDU952 complemented rbsP ( minute 82.5 ) and pyrE ( minute 79.5 ) and probably contained oriC ( minute 82 ) as it was extremely unstable ( 22 ) .
The other F ' plasmid , pDU640 , was more stable and complemented pyrE but not rbsP .
These results suggested that ilvB was located between pyrE and oriC ( Fig. 1 ) .
To locate ilvB more precisely , we isolated a strain with a TnJO element ( zia - 2 ) determined to be 22 % linked to ilvB by P22 cotransduction but not contransducible with rbsP or pyrE .
Isolation of tetracycline - sensitive derivatives from strains containing zia - 2 : : TnJO via ampicillin selection ( 27 ) demonstrated that ilvB was closely linked to uhp , as 60 % of the isolates that lacked AHAS I activity were unable to grow on glucose 6 - phosphate as a sole carbon source .
Thus , ilvB was located at minute 80.5 , a position analogous to the position reported for ilvB in E. coli K - 12 ( 39 ) .
Effect of elevated levels of the ilvB gene on cell growth .
The ilvB gene was cloned by standard procedures with EcoRI and HindIll digests of pBR322 and F ' ilvB DNA from pDU640 .
We isolated a plasmid ( pDU101 ) that complement - VOL .

ed a mutant devoid of AHAS activity ( mutant DU2603 ) .
The AHAS activity present in these transformants was inhibited 85 % by valine , the same sensitivity that is found in ilvG mutants .
The expression of the cloned ilvB gene in transformants of mutant DU2603 was reponsive to regulation by leucine and valine ( Table 2 ) , a property that indicates that the regulatory region was present on the plasmid .
However , transformants of double mutant DU2603 and ilvG mutant DU503 were able to grow in concentrations of valine as high a 1 g/liter .
This valine resistance was attributed to the high level of AHAS I in these organisms .
Role of leucine and valine in the regulation of ilvB .
We attempted to physiologically raise the level of AHAS I activity to a point that would permit the growth of an ilvG mutant in media supplemented with 1 g of valine per liter .
Strain DU5586 ( ilvG236 leu - SOO supX ) was used since it is intrinsically limited for leucine biosynthesis owing to a mutation in the leu regulatory region ( leu - 500 ) that is partially suppressed by the presence of supX ( 37 ) .
When this strain was plated onto minimal - medium supplemented with 1 g of valine per liter , it grew .
The level of AHAS I measured in crude extracts was nearly identical to the level seen in ilvG mutants containing ilvB on a multicopy plasmid ( Table 2 ) .
If , however , in addition to valine , leucine was added to the medium , strain DU5586 no longer grew .
This inability to grow was the result of lowered AHAS I levels , as shown by the very low specific activity of this enzyme in strain DU5586 cultures grown under repressing conditions ( Table 2 ) .
The wide range of AHAS I activities observed in response to the availability of leucine led us to study in greater detail how the end products leucine and valine modulate the expression of ilvB .
The repression of ilvB by leucine was found to require the cognate tRNA molecules , as is true for all amino - acid biosynthetic operons regulated by attenuation .
No repression of ilvB was observed in strains with an altered leucyl - tRNA due to a hisT lesion when these strains were grown in the presence of excess branched - chain amino acids ; the specific activity of AHAS I measured in the presence or absence of the branched - chain amino - acids was 105 nmol/min per mg .
The kinetics of repression of ilvB were compared with those of ilvGEDA , an operon known to be regulated by attenuation ( 28 , 38 ) .
These studies were carried outC.by growing strain DU5586 ( ilvG236 leu - 500 supX ) in the abs6n `` e of leucine to obtain maximal derepression , until the culture reached early log phase .
At this time a sample was removed for enzyme assays , and repressing amounts of the branched - 836 WEINBERG AND BURNS TABLE 2 .

chain amino - acids were added to the remainder of the culture .
The levels of threonine deaminase ( ilvA ) , transaminase B ( HivE ) , and AHAS I ( ilvB ) were measured in samples that were removed periodically until the culture reached stationary - phase .
As Fig. 2A shows , all three enzymes followed the same time course of repression ; however , AHAS I repression was more nearly complete , exhibiting the greatest change in specific activity from the derepressed state to the repressed state .
A determination of the extent of enzyme synthesis after imposition of repressing conditions suggested that synthesis of AHAS I very nearly ceased , whereas synthesis of threonine deaminase and transaminase B continued ( Fig. 2B ) .
These results suggested that ilvB expression was very tightly regulated .
Effect of the cAMP - CRP complex on the expression of ilvB .
It was reported by Whitlow and Polglase ( 48 ) that growth of E. coli K - 12 on carbon sources that were subject to catabolite repression allowed this strain to grow in the presence of valine owing to the high level of activity of AHAS I present , a result analogous to the results described above .
We wanted to determine whether the same phenomenom of carbon source - induced valine resistance was possible in S. typhimurium .
To test this possibility , we grew ilvG mutant DU503 on carbon sources that differed in ability to elicit catabolite C E 1000 A 900 - 800 700 600 10 9 8 7 B ' - E C 5001 400 5 4 3001 200 look 3 2 .1 2 .3 4 .5 .6 7 .8 9 1.0 A420 2 .3 4 .5 6 .7 .8 .9 10 A420 FIG. 2 .

The enzymes assayed were threonine deaminase ( TD ) , the product of ilvA , transaminase B ( TrB ) , the product of UivE , and AHAS I , the product of ilvB .
( A ) Absorbance versus specific activity .
Strain DU5586 was grown on minimal - medium until the culture reached early log phase .
Repressing conditions were then imposed by the addition of 50 mg of isoleucine per liter , 100 mg of leucine per liter , and 100 mg of valine per liter .
Samples were removed when the culture reached the levels of absorbance at 420 nm ( A420 ) indicated , and the enzymes were assayed .
The first sample was taken prior to the addition of the amino - acids and represents the derepressed level of enzyme expression .
( B ) Absorbance of the repressed culture versus ratio of actual specific activity to theoretical specific activity .
The theoretical specific activity was determined by dividing the activity per milliliter obtained in the derepressed crude extract by the protein concentration of the crude extract at a given time point , thus assuming that none of the newly synthesized protein was present as the enzyme .
If repression were complete , the data points would lie on the dashed line .

No correlation was evident between the level of ilvB expression and the extent to which each carbon source allowed rapid growth and , hence , generated catabolite - repression .
In addition , none of these carbon sources allowed growth in the presence of valine .
However , when a mutation in cya or crp was introduced into the strain , there was a dramatic reduction in ilvB expression ( Table 3 ) .
This suggests that , as in E. coli , AHAS I synthesis in S. typhimurium was sensitive to the cAMP - CRP complex .
The addition of cAMP restored the level of AHAS I activity in cya strain DU8811 but had no effect on crp derivative DU8812 , indicating that cAMP was acting through CRP .
An interesting finding during these experiments was the reduction of AHAS I activity when cAMP was added to a strain that responds normally to catabolite - repression ( strain DU503 ) ( Table 3 ) .
The reason for this decline was not clear .
Little effect on the expression of the other isoleucine and valine biosynthetic enzymes was observed , although the enzyme activities did decrease slightly upon the addition of cAMP to the medium .
Expression of ilvB remained subject to repression by the branched - chain amino - acids in the presence of the cya and crp mutations .
Since we were unable to obtain an increase in AHAS I activity sufficient to allow - growth of an ilvG mutant on valine by raising the level of cAMP - CRP physiologically , we tried another method to increase the concentration of CRP in the cells .
ilvG mutant DU503 was transformed with a multicopy plasmid containing the crp gene , pHA7 ( 1 ) .
The resulting transformants exhibited elevated expression of ilvB nearly equivalent to the levels seen when the same strain harbored ilvB plasmid pDU1l1 ( Table 2 ) .
Furthermore , the cells transformed with the crp plasmid were able to grow in the presence of 1 g of valine per liter .
( This effect was found to be cAMP dependent .
) These results suggested that haploid levels of CRP did not allow maximal expression of ilvB in S. typhimurium .
In an attempt to determine the concentration of CRP needed to allow maximal ilvB expression , we constructed a pBR322 derivative , pDU111 , that contained both ilvB and crp ( Fig. 3 ) .
( It should be noted that the cloned ilvB gene was responsive to enhancement by CRP ; very low levels of AHAS activity were detected when ilvB plasmid pDU1O1 was present in a strain containing a mutation in crp [ strain DU8812 ] [ Table 2 ] .
) The presence of both genes , ilvB and crp , on the plasmid allowed higher levels of AHAS I activity than when either gene was present on the plasmid alone ( Table 2 ) .
However , the increase in expression was at best twofold , or equivalent to the sum of the activities measured in a strain containing the ilvB plasmid ( strain DU2603/pDU101 ) and a strain containing the crp plasmid ( strain DU503/pHA7 ) .
Thus , these results suggested that the increased level of CRP due to the plasmid was only great enough to maximally induce one copy of ilvB .
Isolation and characterization of strain DU513 , a regulatory mutant of iIvB .
Mutants that exhibited aberrant regulation of ilvB expression were obtained by plating 108 cells of valinesensitive ilvG mutant DU503 on minimal glucose medium containing 1 g of valine per liter and selecting for valineresistant colonies .
Such colonies appeared at a frequency of 10 - 6 .
Surprisingly , all of the isolates examined had the same phenotype ; all constitutively overproduced valine - sensitive AHAS .
One strain , strain DU513 , was kept for further study .
Expression of AHAS I in this strain was totally refractory to repression by leucine and valine , as indicated by the equivalent level of activity present in a leucinerequiring variant , strain DU512 , grown either in a chemostat EcoARI - H , ndBI EcoRI FIG. 3 .
Both pDU1O1 and pHA7 were digested with EcoRI and ligated .
The crp gene was transcribed from a plasmid promoter near the EcoRI site ( 1 ) .

under limiting leucine conditions or under repressing conditions ( Table 4 ) .
Thus , once again high levels of AHAS I overcame valine toxicity .
The mutation causing this phenotype was designated ilv - 513 .
Transductional analysis revealed that the ilv - 513 lesion was not cotransducible with the ilvB structural gene and , therefore , was not in the promoter or attenuator region .
Upon assaying other enzymes in the ilv pathway , threonine deaminase ( ilvA ) and transaminase B ( HivE ) , as well as , - isopropylmalate dehydrogenase ( leuB ) , in crude extracts of valine - resistant strain DU513 , we found that the expression of these enzymes was also no longer repressed by the branched - chain amino - acids ( compare Table 3 , strain DU503 , and Table 5 , strain DU513 ) .
These observations led us to ask whether the ilv - 513 mutation might be acting as a general anti - terminator for attenuated systems .
To test this hypothesis , the levels of expression of two attenuated genes , hisB and thrA , not directly involved in the biosynthesis of the branched - chain amino - acids , were assayed in valineresistant strain DU513 .
The results argued against this hypothesis since both genes were expressed at normal levels and responded to repression in strain DU513 ( Table 6 ) .
( The high level of homoserine dehydrogenase in strain DU503 reflected the isoleucine limitation in that strain [ 42 ] .
) Furthermore , the data in Table 4 indicate that the level of threonine deaminase could be repressed in an ilv - 513 - bearing strain , strain DU512 ( ilv - 513 ilvG236 leu - 124 ) , although it was not repressible in the parent strain , strain DU513 .
The reason for the discrepancy in the repressibility of ilvA in a valine - resistant strain that has a mutation in the leu operon and in a strain that does not was not at all clear .
Effect of ilv - 513 on cAMP - CRP regulation of ilvB .

end products leucine and valine and the cAMP - CRP complex , we carried out studies to investigate whether the ilv - 513 lesion affected this latter mode of regulation as well .
We found that introduction of either a cya or crp mutation into valine - resistant strain DU513 lowered the level of activity of AHAS I ( Table 5 ) , as it had done in valine - sensitive strain DU503 , and that the addition of cAMP to cya ilv - 513 double mutant DU8821 restored the activity of AHAS I to nearly wild - type levels .
The ilvB expression in these cya and crp strains , however , was still refractory to repression by leucine and valine .
Again , as in valine - sensitive strain DU503 , the introduction of crp plasmid pHA7 into valine - resistant strain DU513 and its crp derivative , strain DU8822 , led to increased expression of ilvB ( Table 7 ) .
This expression was also refractory to repression by the branched - chain amino acids ( Table 7 ) .
These results demonstrated that the ilv - 513 mutation did not affect the cAMP - CRP - mediated regulation of ilvB and supported the notion that the regulation mediated by the cAMP - CRP complex was acting independently of that mediated by leucine and valine .
Mapping of the ilv - 513 mutation .
In an attempt to identify the target of the ilv - 513 lesion , we tested the sensitivity of valine - resistant strain DU513 to a number of antibiotics .
The most striking observation which we obtained was the increased resistance of this mutant to fosfomycin .
It grew in the presence of 75 mg of fosfomycin per liter when the inducer glucose 6 - phosphate was present , whereas the growth of the valine - sensitive strain was inhibited by as little as 7.5 mg/liter .
An increase in resistance to fosfomycin can arise as a result of mutations in a number of systems , including glucose - 6-phosphate uptake , the cAMP - CRP complex , or the phosphoenol pyruvate - dependent sugar phos - Specific activities of isoleucine and valine biosynthetic enzymes and P - isopropylmalate dehydrogenase in strain DU513 and its cya and crp derivatives Sp act ( nmol/min per mg of protein ) Strain DU513 Strain DU8821 cya Strain DU8822 crp Growth P3 - Isopro - Trn - 0-Isopro - Trn - P-Isoproconditions Threonine Trans - AHAS pylmalate Threonine amin - AHAS pylmalate Threonine Tamn AHAS pylmalate deaminase asmenB I dehydroge - deaminase ase B I dehydroge - deaminase asenB I dehydrogenase nase nase TABLE 5 .

We favored the latter as the site of alteration in the valine - resistant strain since we had observed that this strain grew normally on glucose 6 - phosphate and appeared to be unaltered in cAMP - CRP regulation of ilvB .
Therefore , a transductional analysis , was carried out to determine the linkage of ilv - 513 to pts ( Table 8 ) .
Each of four ilvG236 pts mutants was infected with a P22 lysate grown on valine - resistant strain DU513 .
Transductants were selected either for their ability to grow on mannitol as a sole carbon source , ( pts + ) ( 16 ) , or for valine resistance .
Cotransductional frequencies demonstrated that jlv - 513 was closely linked to pts and that the gene order was most likely ptsHI crr ilv - 513 .
However , the degree of linkage was not reciprocal ; when the primary selection was done on minimal medium supplemented with valine , the cotransductional frequencies were greater .
We also noted that the introduction of ilv - 513 into two of the pts mutants , strains DU5526 ( ptsH ) and DU5525 ( ptsIcrr ) , always led to correction of the pts lesion , possibly suggesting that the gene products interact with one another .
Another set of observations suggested a possible interlock between AHAS I and the PTS .
This view was based on the demonstration that one substrate of AHAS I , pyruvate , is the product of the first step in the PTS pathway and the other AHAS I substrate , a - ketobutyrate , is an inhibitor of this reaction ( 16 ) .
We have observed that introduction of the crp lesion into an ilvG mutant which accumulates a - ketobutyrate ( 42 ) greatly retarded its growth and that the crp mutation was extremely unstable in this background .
Such a result was not obtained when the crp lesion was introduced into the valineresistant strain which did not accumulate a - ketobutyrate .
Therefore , it seemed plausible that the presence of the crp lesion in the ilvG mutant might exacerbate the possible TABLE 8 .

EXPRESSION OF ilvB OPERON IN S. TYPHIMURIUM 839 inhibition of PTS by a - ketobutyrate , causing the growth - rate to diminish .
To test this hypothesis , a crp mutant deleted in the ilvGEDA operon and therefore unable to synthesize cxketobutyrate was grown in the presence of this metabolite .
After several passages this strain lost its Crp phenotype and the crp mutation could not be retrieved from these revertants , mimicking the results obtained with the ilvG crp mutant .
Cis - trans analysis of the ilv - 513 mutation .
We expected from its distal location in relation to ilvB that the lesion causing valine resistance could act in trans .
Valine - resistant strain DU513 and its ilvB and crp derivatives , strains DU2613 and DU8822 , were transformed with the ilvB plasmid pDU1l1 to determine whether this was the case .
We found that the percent increase in ilvB expression in the valine - resistant strain that had been transformed was equivalent to that observed in the valine - sensitive strain harboring the same plasmid ( Tables 2 and 7 ) .
Furthermore , the expression of ilvB by the plasmid in the valine - resistant background was not repressed by the branched - chain amino - acids .
( The slight decrease in activity seen under repressing conditions may reflect copy number differences .
) These results suggested that the ilv - 513 mutation could act in trans .
DISCUSSION The results presented above indicate that the regulation of the ilvB operon in S. typhimurium is complex .
Although immediately involved in the biosynthesis of the branchedchain amino - acids , this gene is not part of the major ilv operon , nor is it closely linked to it .
Synthesis of the gene product AHAS I is repressed by the end products leucine and valine , is enhanced by the cAMP - CRP complex , and is possibly modulated by the PTS .
It is most probable that the repression caused by the end products leucine and valine is mediated by attenuation in S. typhimurium .
This assumption is based on analogy to the E. coli system ( 18 , 21 ) , as well as the lack of repression which we observed in hisT mutants of S. typhimurium .
The degree of repression achieved by attenuation was found to be large .
The kinetics of repression presented above indicate that the attenuation of ilvB is much more efficient than the attenuation of the major ilv operon .
It appears that the repression of AHAS I synthesis is nearly complete .
The expression of ilvB in S. typhimurium is enhanced by the cAMP - CRP complex , as was found to be the case in E. coli ( 46 , 48 ) .
This is clear from the lower level of AHAS I activity measured in cya and crp mutants of S. typhimurium and by the rise in AHAS I activity seen when crp was present on a multicopy plasmid .
( It should be pointed out that no such rise in 0 - galactosidase activity was reported when a similar crp plasmid was present in E. coli [ 26 ] .
) However , differences do exist concerning the degree to which this enhancement of ilvB expression operates in the two species .
Whereas a rise in AHAS I activity in E. coli was observed in response to growth on carbon sources that lack the ability to cause catabolite - repression ( 46 ) , no such increase in AHAS I activity was observed in S. typhimurium ; nor could a poor carbon source permit growth of an ilvG mutant in the presence of valine , as it has been shown to do in E. coli K - 12 ( 48 ) .
Other workers have demonstrated in vitro that CRP binds to the ilvB promoter DNA of E. coli ( P. Friden and M. Freundlich , Fed .
Therefore , it is possible that the binding of CRP to the ilvB promoter in S. typhimurium is weaker than that in E. coli .
We suggest from our results that the expression of ilvB in response to attenuation ( leucine - valine ) is independent of 840 WEINBERG AND BURNS that attributable to the cAMP - CRP complex .
The introduction of a cya or crp mutation does not affect the repression of ilvB by leucine and valine , nor does the presence of crp on a multicopy plasmid .
Furthermore , valine - resistant strain DU513 , which is refractory to repression by leucine and valine , shows normal cAMP - CRP regulation .
This is apparent from the decrease in gene expression upon introduction of a cya or crp mutation and the increased expression upon introduction of a crp - containing plasmid .
In addition , these alterations in the concentration of the CRP in the cell did not restore the response to leucine - valine repression .
Strains of S. typhimurium having a mutation in ilvG are like E. coli K - 12 in that they are not able to grow in the presence of valine because they can not synthesize isoleucine ( 40 ) .
We demonstrated that the valine toxicity of ilvG mutants of S. typhimurium could be overcome by raising the level of AHAS I .
This increase was achieved in the following ways : ( i ) cells were grown under conditions that caused extreme leucine limitation ; ( ii ) ilvB was introduced on a multicopy plasmid ; ( iii ) a multicopy plasmid containing crp was introduced ; and ( iv ) the ilv - 513 mutation was present .
Since in all of these instances 15 % of the AHAS I activity was detected even when 1 mM valine was added to the reaction mixture , it is possible that this fraction of activity is great enough to allow isoleucine synthesis when the enzyme is present at greatly elevated levels .
The cause of the increase in ilvB expression when the ilv - 513 mutation is present is not clear .
The lack of repression by the branched - chain amino - acids of ilvB as well as ilvGEDA suggests that the mutation might affect one of the cognate tRNA molecules , in particular the leucyl - tRNA gene , as expression of the leu operon is also affected .
There are several arguments which can be raised against this possibility .
First , the map location of the mutation does not coincide with any of the described leucyl - tRNA structural genes ( 9 ) or with the leucyl - tRNA synthetase gene ( 43 ) .
Second , E. coli K - 12 strains mutant in leucyl - or valyl - tRNA have not been reported to be valine resistant .
( Similarly , the introduction of hisT into an ilvG mutant did not allow its growth on valine .
) Third , repression of threonine deaminase was evident in a strain harboring the valine resistance mutation when the leu - 124 lesion was present , yet ilvB expression was still refractory to repression .
Fourth , the generation time of the valine - resistant strain was not affected by the addition of the branched - chain amino - acids ( data not shown ) .
Fifth , the inability to obtain the valine - resistant lesion in certain PTS - deficient strains is not at all indicative of a tRNA mutant .
The close linkage of ilv - 513 to pts , the inability to obtain the mutation in ptsH or ptsIcrr strains , the increased resistance to fosfomycin , and the increased stability of the crp lesion in the valine - resistant strain compared with the valinesensitive parent all suggested that the phenotype observed in ilv - 513 mutants may reflect an alteration in PTS action .
It is possible that the selective pressure being exerted by plating the ilvG mutant onto valine - containing medium is not starvation for isoleucine but rather a need to rid the cell of excess a - ketobutyrate that is accumulating as a result of the inhibition of AHAS I by valine .
Daniel et al ( 11 ) have identified a - ketobutyrate as a putative alarmone whose primary target is the PTS .
In this regard it should be noted that although we were able to isolate a large number of these valine - resistant colonies when the selection was done on glucose , no such revertants were obtained when glucose 6 - phosphate , a non - PTS sugar , was used as the carbon source .
This observation , along with the finding of other workers that growth of E. coli J. BACTERIOL .
on glucose is inhibited by the addition of a - ketobutyrate but growth - on - glucose 6 - phosphate is not ( 11 ) , supports the hypothesis presented above .
One pathway by which cells can lower the level of a - ketobutyrate is to increase the level of activity of AHAS I. Components of the PTS complex have been shown to affect initiation of transcription at operons that are catabolite repressible , and this effect is most pronounced when cAMP - CRP is limiting ( 19 ) .
The ilvB operon is such an operon .
This conclusion is based on our evidence that haploid levels of CRP are not sufficient to fully enhance AHAS I synthesis .
Precisely what is altered by the ilv - 513 lesion and how it overrides attenuation of both the ilvB and ilvGEDA operons is not clear at the present time .
