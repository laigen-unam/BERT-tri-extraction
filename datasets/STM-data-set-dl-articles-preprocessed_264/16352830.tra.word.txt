PmrA and PhoP are the only known activators of pmrCAB .
A transposon mutagenesis screen for additional regulators of a pmrC : : MudJ fusion led to the identification of a two - component system , termed PreA/PreB ( pmrCAB regulators A and B ) , that controls the transcription of the pmrCAB operon in response to unknown signals .
The initial observations indicated that insertions in , or a deletion of , the preB sensor , but not the preA response regulator , caused upregulation of pmrCAB .
Interestingly , the expression of pmrCAB was not upregulated in a preAB mutant grown in LB broth , implicating PreA in the increased expression of pmrCAB in the preB strain .
This was confirmed by overexpression of preA in preAB or preB backgrounds , which resulted in significant upregulation or further upregulation of pmrCAB .
No such effect was observed in any tested preB backgrounds .
Additionally , an ectopic construct expressing a preA [ D51A ] allele also failed to upregulate pmrC in any of the pre backgrounds tested , which implies that there is a need for phosphorylation in the activation of the target genes .
The observed upregulation of pmrCAB occurred independently of the response regulators PmrA and PhoP .
Although a preB mutation led to increased transcription of pmrCAB , this did not result in a measurable effect on polymyxin B resistance .
Our genetic data support a model of regulation whereby , in response to unknown signals , the PreB sensor activates PreA , which in turn indirectly upregulates pmrCAB transcription .
Bacterial two - component systems ( TCS ) couple extracellular and intracellular signals to the transcriptional expression of genes or to the posttranslational regulation of molecular motors or enzymes ( 39 ) .
In particular , transcription of virulence genes in microbial pathogens is often tightly regulated and may involve TCS ( 8 ) .
TCS are typically composed of a sensor kinase , frequently membrane bound , and a response regulator .
The sensor kinase responds to specific signals resulting in a net increase in the autophosphorylation rate of a conserved histidine residue of its C - terminal transmitter domain .
The phosphate moiety is then transferred to a conserved aspartyl residue located in an acidic pocket on the N - terminal receiver domain of the cognate response regulator .
The phosphorylated form of the response regulator is the effector of the signal transduction event , activating or repressing transcription or enzyme activities .
The signaling is switched off by the unstable nature of the aspartyl phosphate moiety or by cellular phosphatases , including bifunctional sensors ( 19 ) .

Many Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium TCS have been shown to be important for virulence .
For instance , SirA / BarA ( 21 , 43 ) and EnvZ/OmpR ( 24 ) are all indirectly involved in regulating SPI - 1 invasion genes .
Also , the TCS SsrA/SsrB directly controls expression of SPI - 2 intramacrophage survival genes ( 5 , 9 ) , while PhoP/PhoQ controls a vast regulon that includes invasion genes , macrophage survival genes , cation transporters , and genes involved in antimicrobial peptide ( AP ) resistance ( 10 , 30 ) .
Often , TCS regulate other TCS at both transcriptional and posttranslational levels .
For instance , PhoP has been recently shown to bind and regulate an internal promoter that drives the expression of the SPI - 2 regulator ssrB ( 2 ) , while at the same time , it controls dephosphorylation of the PmrA response regulator via transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the small protein PmrD ( 22 , 23 ) .
PmrA/PmrB is another TCS both necessary for resistance to polymyxin B ( PMB ) in - vitro and important for oral virulence in the mouse model of enteric fever ( 14 , 15 , 36 ) .
PmrA/PmrB regulates the expression of a complex regulon that includes pmrCAB , pmrE , pmrG , pmrFHIJKLM , cptA , and several other genes ( 15 , 25 , 40 , 41 ) .
Some of these genes were shown to be involved in modifying the lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , altering the surface charge and reducing the binding of cationic APs such as PMB ( 11 , 13 , 16 ) .
APs are important components of the host innate immune system .
They are found at mucosal and skin surfaces and within professional phagocytes ( 18 , 33 ) .
APs bind to the LPS in enterobacteria , gaining entry into the cell and most often causing perforation of the cytoplasmic mem - 141 142 MERIGHI ET AL. .

brane and eventual death ( 45 ) .
Besides being indirectly regulated by PhoP/PhoQ via the mechanism mentioned above , some PmrA - regulated genes such as ugd/pmrE are also transcriptionally controlled by the RcsB/RcsC two - component system ( 31 ) .
The fact that multiple signals/signaling pathways converge to modulate the Salmonella polymyxin resistance regulon suggests its critical importance for the adaptation / survival in both extracellular and intracellular environments .
Additionally , previous work from our laboratory suggests that in - vivo , regulators other than PmrA might be involved in controlling the expression of the pmrFHIJKLM operon ( 15 ) .
In this study , we describe a Salmonella TCS , named PreA / PreB , that was identified in a transposon mutagenesis screen for regulators of pmrCAB .
PreA/PreB is similar to the luxSdependent quorum - sensing regulatory system QseB/QseC in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( 37 ) .
We demonstrate that PreA activates the transcription of pmrCAB in a PhoP - and PmrA response regulator - independent fashion .
The results suggest that sensor kinase PreB inactivates PreA during - growth in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth and that PreA is indirectly involved in pmrCAB regulation .
Furthermore , the observed increase in pmrCAB transcription does not lead to observable transcriptional activation of most of the PmrA/PmrB regulon or to the alteration of the polymyxin resistance phenotype .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth - conditions .
E. coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
LB broth and agar were used for strain maintenance , cloning , and expression experiments .
For gene expression experiments , strains were grown in a rotating drum to mid - to late exponential phase ( optical density at 600 nm [ OD 600 ] of 0.6 to 0.9 ) .
When appropriate , antibiotics were added at the following concentrations : ampicillin , 100 g/ml ; chloramphenicol , 25 g/ml ; kanamycin , 25 g/ml ; tetracycline , 25 g/ml ; streptomycin , 100 g/ml .
Molecular biology and genetic techniques .
DNA purification , molecular cloning , and PCR were performed according to standard procedures ( 1 ) .
Plasmids were mobilized by electroporation .
Transposon mutagenesis was performed with Tn10d and MudJ transposons as previously described ( 12 ) .
Marked mutations were transferred between Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains by P22 HT105 int - 102 - mediated generalized transduction as described previously ( 20 , 34 ) .
DNA sequencing and bioinformatics .
DNA sequencing was performed using a Big Dye fluorescent terminator and an ABI3770 capillary sequencer at the Nucleic Acid Core Facility , University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio , and the Plant Microbe Genomic Facility at The Ohio State University .
DNA sequences were analyzed by Blastx at the NCBI ( 27 ) .
Domain structure was analyzed by CDD searches ( 26 ) .
ClustalW was used to produce global progressive alignments ( 44 ) .
Construction of mutants and plasmids .
Nonpolar deletions of preA and preB were created using - Red mutagenesis ( 6 ) .
In particular , primers JG489 and JG490 or JG557 and JG558 ( Table 2 ) were designed to amplify preA - kan - preA and preB - kan - preB cassettes , respectively , while primers JG489 and JG558 amplified preA - cat - preB using pKD3 or pKD4 as a template .
The recombinant antibiotic cassettes were exchanged into the chromosome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s ( pKD46 ) to generate strains JSG1987 preA : : kan , JSG2344 preB : : kan , and JSG2626 preAB : : cat ( Table 1 ) .
The antibiotic cassettes were resolved by introducing pCP20 , and the resulting unmarked strains were named JSG1998 preA , JSG2626 preAB , and JSG2343 preB .
A missense mutation to glycine was generated at the PreB predicted autophosphorylation site H246 .
Spliced overlap extension ( SOE ) - PCR with JG637 and JG634 as flanking primers and JG635 and JG636 as mutagenic primers was used to construct the mutant allele in - vitro .
The preB [ H246G ] allele was ligated into the suicide vector pKAS46 as a 1.2 - kb EcoRI/NotI fragment to produce plasmid pJSG2381 in E. coli SM10 pir .
Allele exchange with pJSG2381 was performed using JSG542 , a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028 Str r derivative , as the recipient strain .
The correct recombinant was confirmed by sequencing and was labeled JSG2364 .
The phosphorylation site at residue D51 of pmrA was mutated to alanine by SOE - PCR using primers JG797 and JG798 ( flanking primers ) with JG795 and JG796 ( internal primers ) .
The pmrA [ D51A ] allele was cloned as an SstI - XhoI fragment into the suicide vector pLD55 ( 28 ) to produce plasmid pJSG2456 in E. coli BW20339 .
Allele exchange into strain JSG2003 preA pmrC : : MudJ was performed using Bochner selection , as described previously ( 28 ) , to produce strain JSG2481 .
The pmrC : : MudJ pmrA [ D51A ] locus was further mobilized in several genetic backgrounds by P22 transduction selecting for the Kan r marker of MudJ linked to the pmrA mutation .
The correct recombinant was verified by PCR and restriction analysis of the pmrA [ D51A ] allele at the engineered NheI site .
The entire preAB operon or the preA open reading frame was cloned into pBAD18 for expression from P BAD as a JG708 and JG709 or a JG1055 and JG1056 PCR fragment to produce plasmids pJSG2581 and pJSG2558 , respectively .
Plasmid pJSG2558 was mutagenized at the conserved D51 residue of preA by oligomutagenesis with primers JG1190 and JG1191 using the Gene Tailor kit ( Invitrogen ) to generate pJSG2700 .
Western blot analysis of His 6 - PreA proteins .
Whole - cell lysates of Salmonella strains were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto HyBond nitrocellulose ( Amersham ) .
Proteins were detected using a primary polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against recombinant His 6 - PreA ( 1:2,000 dilution ) , a donkey anti - rabbit immunoglobulin G 144 MERIGHI ET AL. .

- Galactosidase assays were carried out using either a spectrophotometric method with ortho - nitrophenyl - - D - galactopyranoside ( ONPG ) as a substrate or a modified fluorometric method with 4 - methyl - umbelliferyl - galactopyranoside ( MUGal ) ( 29 ) .
Assays were performed in triplicate .
Specific enzyme activities are reported in Miller units ( ONPG assays ) or in picomoles of released 4 - methyl - umbelliferone per second per OD unit per milliliter of culture ( MUGal assays ) .
Assays were carried out as previously described ( 38 ) .
Briefly , strains were grown in Mueller - Hinton broth overnight , and 10 4 cells per well were added to polypropylene microtiter plates .
Each strain was tested for growth and pellet accumulation against serial dilutions of PMB in 0.2 % bovine serum albumin -- 0.01 % acetic acid for 16 h. Identification and sequence analysis of the preAB operon .
In an effort to identify additional putative regulators of the pmrCAB locus , a Tn10d mutant pool constructed in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s was transduced into the reporter strain JSG215 ( pmrC : : MudJ ) .
Out of 30,000 transductants , a mutant colony producing a strong blue color on LB plates containing X - Gal ( 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ) was isolated .
The mutant phenotype was named Pre ( for pmrCAB regulator ) , while the mutant strain was named JSG1038 .
The mutation was transduced back into the parent strain to rule out second - site mutations ( creating strain JSG1039 ) , and the phenotype was confirmed .
A HindIII fragment containing the region upstream of the transposon , as well as the transposon tetracycline resistance cassette , was shotgun cloned into pWSK29 , producing pJSG975 .
DNA sequencing from the transposon 5 end and sequence analyses revealed that the Tn10d insertion mapped to a gene corresponding to the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 locus ygiY ( STM3178 ) , which has homology to orthodox bacterial sensor kinases ( Fig. 1 ) , most notably to E. coli K - 12 and O157 : H7 QseC ( 87 to 88 % similarity ; E 0.0 ) .
YgiY is predicted to be a 51 - kDa protein with two transmembrane segments between residues 8 and 56 and residues 149 and 199 .
CDD searches and alignments with known sensor kinases predicted a putative autophosphorylation site at residue H246 .
Upstream of ygiY is ygiX ( STM3177 ) , which encodes a 24 - kDa putative response regulator of the OmpR subfamily with high similarity to E. coli O157 : H7 QseB ( 93 % similarity ; E 1 10 107 ) , Pectobacterium carotovorum PmrA ( 64 % similarity ; E 8 10 49 ) , E. coli CFT073 PmrA ( 63 % similarity ; E RESULTS FIG. 2 .

The new TCS locus was renamed preAB .
These two genes form an apparent operon , with the stop codon of ygiX overlapping the start codon of ygiY , an arrangement suggestive of translational coupling .
The high similarity and identity to E. coli QseB/QseC , which controls motility in response to AI - 2 quorum - sensing signals in E. coli strains ( 37 ) , and the almost - identical map position ( Fig. 1 ) directly upstream of mdaB , a putative NADH - dependent oxidoreductase , and ygiN , a putative quinol monooxygenase , and downstream of STM3175 , an AraC - like regulator , and ygiW suggested that these two TCS may be potential orthologs .
Both PreB and PreA affect pmrCAB transcription .
The regulatory effect of the preB : : Tn10d insertion on pmrCAB operon expression was quantified by - galactosidase enzyme assays upon growth of the bacteria in LB - medium to exponentialearly stationary - phase .
Reporter gene activity was measured in a pmrC : : MudJ background .
The results showed an eightfold increase in pmrCAB transcription upon introduction of the preB polar insertion ( strain JSG1039 ) ( Fig. 2 ) .
To rule out possible polar effects of the Tn10d insertion on the downstream genes mdaB and ygiN ( Fig. 1 ) , we created an unmarked deletion in preB ( strain JSG2115 ) using - Red mutagenesis .
This mutation caused the expected upregulation of pmrCAB at levels comparable to those observed in strain JSG1039 ( Fig. 2 ) , and its effects were complemented by preB in trans ( Fig. 3 ) .
We were also able to complement the regulatory effect of the preB mutation with plasmid pQseBC33 ( Fig. 3 ) , which carries the homologous E. coli operon qseBC , implying functional homology between the two regulatory systems .
In general , null mutations in the sensor kinase inactivate a two - component system , but cross talk with the response regulator by alternative kinase or by acetyl phosphate may lead to sensor - independent expression of the two - component system regulon .
To test whether the effect caused by preB was replicated by a preA mutation , we introduced a deletion in the response regulator by - Red mutagenesis ( creating strains JSG1998 and JSG2003 ) .
The resulting mutants did not produce the 26 - kDa polypeptide after Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against PreA ( Fig. 3D , lane 2 ) .
To our surprise , a preA strain did not show upregulation of pmrC : : MudJ ( Fig. 2 ) .
This result was also repeated after reengineering the mutants using independently constructed alleles .
Similar regulatory patterns were obtained by using other plasmid - borne and chromosomal gene fusions FIG. 3 .

Effects of pmrA , phoP , and the PreB putative autophosphorylation site on PreB - mediated regulation of pmrCAB .

Activities are expressed in Miller units .

The following strains were used : JSG215 ( pmrC - lacZ ) , JSG1039 ( preB pmrC - lacZ ) , JSG2422 ( preB [ H246G ] pmrC - lacZ ) , JSG420 ( pmrA pmrC - lacZ ) , JSG2366 ( preB pmrA : : Tn10d pmrC - lacZ ) , JSG2499 ( pmrA [ D51A ] pmrC - lacZ ) , JSG2498 ( preB pmrA [ D51A ] pmrC - lacZ ) , JSG1060 ( phoP pmrC - lacZ ) , and JSG2365 ( preB phoP pmrC - lacZ ) .
to the pmrCAB promoter ( 4 ) , ruling out specific effects on the MudJ operon fusion in pmrC .
This differential regulatory phenotype implies that the effect on pmrCAB was sensor dependent but response regulator independent , possibly due to cross talk of the kinase to unknown regulators .
Another interpretation of this result is that under the growth - conditions employed , the proper signal activating PreB kinase activity was absent ; therefore , a preA response regulator mutant would not show differential regulation compared to the wild - type .
However , for this to be true , one has to assume that the loss of PreB exposes the PreA protein to nonphysiological kinase cross talk that leads to its constitutive activation .
To test these models , a preAB : : cat pmrC : : MudJ double - mutant strain was created and pmrC transcription was analyzed upon growth in LB - medium .
The loss of preA in this double mutant reversed the phenotype of pmrC upregulation observed in the preB mutant ( Fig. 2 ) , confirming that the effect of deleting preB was mediated by PreA and not by PreB cross talk to unknown regulators .
In an additional attempt to disprove the cross talk hypothesis , the PreB conserved histidine at residue 246 , the putative autophosphorylation site identified by sequence alignments to other transmitter domains of TCS kinases , was mutated to a glycine residue .
Expression of pmrC : : MudJ was measured in wild - type , preB , and preB [ H246G ] backgrounds ( Fig. 4 ) .
Transcriptional activity of the fusion was not significantly increased in the preB [ H246G ] background compared to that of wild type ( ca .
This regulatory phenotype is identical to that of a preA or a preAB mutation .
These data suggest a model in which ( i ) both PreA and PreB affect pmrCAB transcription , ( ii ) the PreB sensor is acting as a phosphatase rather than an activating kinase when bacteria are grown in LB - medium , ( iii ) the PreB [ H246G ] protein retains its phosphatase activity , and ( iv ) PreA is phosphorylated by cross talk in the absence of PreB .
As additional confirmation of the involvement of PreA in pmrC regulation , we analyzed the preAB : : cat pmrC : : MudJ FIG. 5 .
Effect of preB mutations on the expression of pmrA regulon promoters .
Salmonella strains were grown in LB - medium , and - galactosidase assays were performed as described in Materials and Methods .
Activities are expressed in Miller units .
Error bars indicate the standard deviations .
Data are from a representative experiment with two replicates .
The following strains were used : JSG1051 ( pmrHFIlacZ ) , JSG1058 ( preB pmrI - lacZ ) , JSG214 ( pmrE - lacZ ) , JSG1040 ( preB pmrE - lacZ ) , JSG1525 ( yibD - lacZ ) , JSG1527 ( preB yibD - lacZ ) , JSG2527 ( preB pmrA yibD : : lacZ ) , JSG2420 ( preA yibD - lacZ ) , and JSG2523 ( preA pmrA yibD - lacZ ) .
strain with an inducible plasmid - borne preA .
Ectopic expression of preA led to a more - than - twofold increase of - galactosidase levels , demonstrating that PreA can activate , directly or indirectly , the pmrCAB operon ( Fig. 3B ) .
The increase of activity by ectopic expression of preA was also statistically significant in the preB background ( P 0.008 ) but less than twofold in magnitude , likely because the chromosomal copy of preA was also expressed ( Fig. 3B ) .
In support of the general paradigm that PreA requires phosphorylation for activating its target genes , a preA [ D51A ] allele ectopically expressed in pBAD18 failed to activate pmrCAB in all the backgrounds tested , in spite of the production of a polypeptide of the expected molecular weight detected using a polyclonal antibody raised against a His 6 - PreA protein ( Fig. 3C ) .
Consistent with the hypothesis that PreB is acting as a phosphatase during growth in LB - medium , upregulation of pmrCAB by ectopic preA was not observed in preB backgrounds ( wild type and the preA mutant ) ( Fig. 3B ) .
Gel shift assays using unphosphorylated or chemically phosphorylated PreA failed to show binding of this protein to the pmrAB regulatory region ( 4 ) , implying indirect regulation of pmrCAB by PreA .
Regulation of pmrCAB transcription is independent of PmrA and PhoP .
PmrA is the only known direct activator of pmrCAB transcription .
PmrA is directly activated by the PmrB kinase and indirectly activated by PhoP/PhoQ via the small protein PmrD , which stabilizes the phosphorylated form of PmrA ( 22 ) .
A model that explains the apparent repressing effect of PreB on pmrCAB transcription might have involved interference of the PreB sensor with PhoP/PhoQ activity .
When phoP was disrupted , transcription of pmrCAB was greatly decreased ( Fig .
188 , 2006 SALMONELLA PreA/B TWO - COMPONENT SYSTEM 147 FIG. 6 .
Working model for PreA/PreB regulation of pmrCAB .
( A ) The genes pmrCAB and yibD are part of the PmrA regulon .
Extracellular signals that affect the PreB sensor are unknown , but growth in LB - medium activates its phosphatase activity , maintaining the PreA response regulator in the unphosphorylated conformation .
In a PreB [ H246G ] background , PreA is also inactivated by the phosphatase activity of the mutant protein .
( B ) Under PreA/PreB - inducing conditions not yet identified , PreA indirectly regulates pmrCAB and yibD .
( C ) Ectopic PreA , but not PreA [ D51A ] , can activate pmrCAB in a preB mutant even when grown in LB - medium , presumably because of signal - independent cellular cross talk , which may become unmasked and more important due to the absence of the cognate sensor protein .
4 ) as expected due to the decreased concentration of cellular PmrD .
However , when the phoP null mutation was introduced into a preB background , the transcriptional activity of pmrCAB still increased by 7 - fold compared to strain JSG215 pmrC : : MudJ ( Fig. 4 ) and by ca. 100 - fold compared to strain JSG1060 phoP pmrC : : MudJ .
This result indicates that the effect of a PreB deletion on pmrCAB transcription was independent of the PhoQ / PhoP/PmrD proteins .
An alternative model of PreB - mediated regulation of pmrCAB could involve PmrA/PmrB , known direct regulators of pmrCAB .
To address this , we introduced a missense substitution to alanine in the putative phosphorylation site of PmrA at residue D51 , and the resulting allele was exchanged into a pmrC : : MudJ reporter strain .
Under pmrCAB - inducing conditions , the pmrA [ D51A ] allele resulted in decreased pmrCAB expression , but the addition of a null mutation in preB again strongly upregulated the pmrC : : MudJ reporter fusion ( JSG2499 versus JSG2498 ) ( Fig. 4 ) .
A similar result was obtained by using a pmrA null mutation ( JSG420 versus JSG2366 ) ( Fig. 4 ) .
Collectively , these results demonstrate that the PreA/PreB - mediated regulation of pmrCAB is independent of PmrA and PhoP .
PreB does not affect PmrA - regulated genes involved in LPS modifications .
Increases in the transcription levels of pmrCAB could be expected to upregulate PmrA - dependent loci .
The PmrA - regulated loci pmrE and pmrHFIJKLM encode proteins necessary for LPS modifications leading to PMB resistance .
To examine if these loci were affected by the loss of preB , - galactosidase activities in JSG1040 ( preB pmrE : : MudJ ) and JSG1058 ( preB pmrI : : MudJ ) were measured and compared to those of reporter strains with a wild - type regulatory background ( JSG214 and JSG1051 ) .
The activity of both fusions was unaffected by the loss of preB ( Fig. 5 ) .
Consistent with the transcriptional data , MIC assays for PMB resistance indicated that the preB mutant showed equal levels of resistance ( 2 g/ml ) to the wild - type strain .
Interestingly , when we examined the effect of preB on another PmrA - regulated gene of unknown function , yibD ( strain JSG1525 versus strain JSG1527 ) ( Fig. 5 ) , we observed a ninefold upregulation of its expression in a preB background , similar to what was seen with pmrCAB .
Also , as observed with pmrCAB , the upregulation of yibD in a preB mutant was largely independent of PmrA , and the loss of preA had little impact on yibD expression ( Fig. 5 ) .
Although not all PmrA - regulated genes have been examined , PreB has only been shown to affect yibD and pmrCAB transcription thus far .
DISCUSSION In this study , we describe an uncharacterized TCS of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , termed PreA/PreB , that activates transcription of the pmrCAB operon and of another PmrA - regulated gene , yibD .
The pmrAB TCS is critical for the activation of a large regulon involved in polymyxin B resistance .
In a Tn10d transposon screen for genes having an effect on pmrC transcription , we isolated an insertion in the PreB sensor kinase .
Based on sequence similarity and map position , the PreA/PreB TCS is homologous to the previously identified E. coli QseB/QseC TCS ( 37 ) .
This E. coli TCS was shown to be responsive to luxS - dependent quorum - sensing signals for regulating flagellar gene expression .
PreA/PreB and QseB/QseC behave as potential orthologs based on the successful complementation of preB null mutants by the E. coli TCS .
In spite of functional complementation , in experiments not reported in this paper , we show that their regulons are not overlapping and that the biological role of this TCS in the two organisms may be different .
The transcriptional regulation of preAB , its genome - wide regulatory effects , and its role in virulence will be described in a separate manuscript .
Initially , the regulation of pmrCAB by PreA/PreB appeared to be unusual in that the sensor kinase , rather than the response regulator , seemed responsible for repressing its transcription during - growth in LB - medium .
Typically , upon phosphorylation , the response regulator activates or represses gene 148 MERIGHI ET AL. .
transcription in response to signals perceived by its cognate sensor kinase .
Therefore , null mutations in the response regulator usually have the same phenotype of mutations in the sensor kinase .
This is not the case for preA and preB .
There are a few examples of TCS pairs cross talking with each other and leading to a bifurcation of regulatory pathways .
For instance , the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium CpxA sensor was shown to indirectly activate hilA , an AraC - like transcription factor regulating SPI - 1 , at the transcriptional level in a CpxR response regulator - independent manner ( 32 ) .
Another example of cross talk between response regulators and kinases of different cognate pairs is found in E. coli , where the CreC sensor kinase regulates the PhoB - PhoR system ( 47 ) .
Subsequent experiments using preAB double mutants and ectopic expression of preA led us to formulate a different model whereby PreA acts as an activator of pmrCAB , likely in an indirect fashion .
Furthermore , the observation that neither a preA nor a preAB mutation affects pmrCAB expression , while preB mutations do , suggests that under the growth - conditions used , the PreA/PreB system is not perceiving a signal able to stimulate the kinase activity of the sensor .
Concurrently , we must hypothesize that the absence of the cognate sensor kinase leads to a constitutive activation of PreA by cross talk .
Based on the data collected with the ectopic expression of preA [ D51A ] , the activation of wild - type PreA occurs by phosphorylation at residue D51 , following a common TCS paradigm .
Point mutations abolishing only the putative phosphorylation site of PreB showed phenotypes similar to those of preA and preAB mutations , presumably because its phosphatase activity is unaffected , and/or the PreB [ H246G ] protein complexes PreA , protecting it from cross talk .
Because the only two known activators of pmrCAB are PmrA , by autoregulation ( 14 , 36 ) , and PhoP , via the PmrD small protein ( 23 ) , we tested both regulatory systems for their genetic interactions with the preB mutation .
We found that functional null mutations in pmrA ( both deletions and missense mutations ) or phoP did not affect the observed upregulation of pmrC in the preB background .
This suggests that PreA/PreB does not act through the two known regulatory pathways controlling pmrCAB .
Given that preB null mutations lead to the upregulation of pmrCAB transcription , one would expect that the concomitant increased levels of PmrA and PmrB proteins may result in the upregulation of genes in the PmrA regulon .
This was not the case , because of several genes tested , only pmrCAB and yibD , an open reading frame of unknown function regulated by PmrA ( 41 ) , were upregulated in a preB background , and the polymyxin resistance phenotype was not altered compared to that of the wild type .
Perhaps PreA/PreB potentiates the PmrA/PmrB system by increasing the levels of these proteins to allow a quicker response upon encountering PmrA/PmrBactivating conditions .
It is not clear why yibD is the only PmrAregulated gene to also be regulated by PreA/PreB .
Our data imply that the signal activating PreA/PreB , not yet identified , is absent during - growth in LB - medium to exponential - early stationary - phase ( Fig. 6 ) .
The analysis of the genomewide regulon controlled by this novel TCS may help to build a new hypothesis concerning its function in - vivo and the signals modulating its activation in various niches .
