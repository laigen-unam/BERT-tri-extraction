DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research a and Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences , b McMaster University , Hamilton , Ontario Canada ; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine c and Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology , d University of California Irvine , Irvine , California , USA Salmonella pathogenicity island 12 ( SPI - 12 ) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a 15 - kb region that encompasses genes STM2230 to STM2245 and encodes a remnant phage known to contribute to bacterial virulence .
In mouse infection experiments and replication assays in macrophages , we demonstrated a role for four genes in SPI - 12 for bacterial survival in the host .
STM2239 , a potential Q antiterminator , showed a prominent contribution to bacterial fitness .
Transcriptional reporter experiments , quantitative reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) , and immunoblotting demonstrated that the virulence regulator SsrB and STM2239 contribute to transcriptional activation of genes in SPI - 12 .
SsrB was found to indirectly regulate this locus by transcriptional read - through from the sspH2 ( STM2241 ) promoter .
Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that STM2239 copurified with the promoter regulating STM2237 , suggesting that STM2239 may function as an antiterminator to activate adjacent genes .
These results demonstrate that bacteriophage genes may be adapted by pathogenic bacteria to improve fitness in the host .
Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) is a prominent driver of evolution in bacterial pathogens , allowing rapid adaptation to new environments ( 1 ) .
These integration events have shaped the genomic landscape of many organisms and in some cases contributed to host range expansion , such as the acquisition of the intracellular virulence machinery encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI - 2 ) ( 2 -- 6 ) .
While there are several mechanisms by which HGT can occur , bacteriophage - mediated transduction has contributed significantly to the mosaic nature of bacterial genomes , introducing substantial diversity not only among different species but also within subspecies ( 7 ) .
In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , prophages have introduced a number of virulence - factors that contribute to the pathogenic nature of this organism .
These genes , called lysogenic conversion genes , are integrated into new bacterial genomes through passive carriage by bacteriophages that can package bacterial genes from one host during a lytic cycle and introduce this new genetic content into a subsequent host ( 8 ) .
S. Typhimurium has acquired an extensive arsenal of virulence genes in this manner , including sopE , contained within the SopE prophage ; gogB , contained within Gifsy - 1 ; sseI and gtgE , contained within Gifsy - 2 ; and the superoxide dismutase genes sodC1 and sodC3 , contained within Gifsy - 2 and Fels - 1 , respectively ( 9 -- 15 ) .
Additionally , several other virulence genes are contained within cryptic prophages .
Many of these phage loci are remnants with a reduced repertoire of phage genes rendering them unable to produce viable phage .
As with intact prophage , remnant phage islands can be associated with genes that confer a virulence or fitness advantage on the bacterial host as part of adaptation to specific environments ( 16 ) .
The incorporation of horizontally acquired genes into existing regulatory networks has been the subject of much research , particularly with Salmonella .
Transcriptional regulators involved in the activation of virulence - factors have been extensively studied , with PhoP and SsrB integrating large regulons important for infection ( 17 , 18 ) .
We recently identified the regulatory logic controlling SsrB - DNA interactions and showed that the SsrB response regulator controls about 4 % of the Salmonella genome ( 19 ) , including genes in the remnant phage in Salmonella pathogenicity island 12 ( SPI - 12 ) ( 19 -- 21 ) .
Previous work showed that SPI - 12 contributes to S. Typhimurium systemic survival in mice ; however , the individual genes responsible for this fitness benefit were not identified ( 22 ) .
In this study , we investigated the mechanism of SPI - 12 regulation by SsrB and quantified the fitness benefit associated with individual SPI - 12 genes during host infection .
We show that STM2239 , a putative Q antiterminator , accounts for much of the fitness benefit associated with SPI - 12 .
STM2239 is expressed through transcriptional read - through from the SsrBcontrolled sspH2 promoter and subsequently activates additional phage genes in SPI - 12 .

RESULTS Bacteriophage genes within SPI - 12 contribute to in - vivo fitness of Salmonella Typhimurium .
Previous experiments had identified SPI - 12 as a pathogenicity island , where a mutant with a deletion of STM2230 to STM2245 was attenuated in mice ( Fig. 1 ) ( 22 ) .
We later identified five genes in SPI - 12 using microarray and ChIP - on - chip studies as being regulated by SsrB in Salmonella ( 19 ) .
Due to their association with SsrB , a known virulence gene regulator , we followed up these bacteriophage genes to establish whether they contribute to Salmonella survival during host infection .
To define the fitness contribution of the bacteriophage genes encoded in this island , we deleted genes STM2234 to STM2240 and tested this strain for its ability to compete with wild - type cells during systemic infection in mice .
The competitive indices ( CIs ) in the spleen , liver , and cecum at 3 days postinfection were 0.38 0.27 ( P 0.001 ) , 0.46 0.35 ( P 0.001 ) , and 0.58 0.32 ( 0.01 P 0.05 ) , respectively , for the STM2234 - STM2240 deletion strain , indicating that the mutant was attenuated for systemic dissemination compared to the wild type ( Fig. 2A ) .
These results were in agreement with those of Haneda et al. , indicating that one or more fitness factors may be encoded among the bacteriophage genes in SPI - 12 ( 22 ) .
We made single mutations in STM2234 , July 2013 Volume 81 Number 7 iai.asm.org 2397 Tomljenovic - Berube et al. .

STM2238 was not included because it was not SsrB regulated in our experiments and thus was not prioritized for followup .
Of the six mutants tested , four ( STM2234 , STM2235 , STM2236 , and STM2239 ) showed a fitness defect ( Fig. 2B ) .
The STM2239 mutant was most affected in competition experiments with the wild type , with CIs of 0.10 0.097 ( P 0.0001 ) and 0.120 0.126 ( P 0.0001 ) in the spleen and liver , respectively .
These mutants exhibited no general growth defects when grown in - vitro in LB - medium and LPM , pH - 5.8 ( see Fig .
S1 in the supplemental material ) .
We performed additional competition experiments evaluating the contribution of STM2239 in comparison to the other genes within the locus , testing the STM2239 mutant against the STM2234 - STM2240 mutant and against an STM2234 - STM2237 mutant .
The STM2239 mutant competed against the STM2234 - STM2240 mutant produced CIs of 0.92 0.86 and 1.17 0.82 in the spleen and liver , respectively , indicating that the two mutants competed equally ( Fig. 2C ) .
The STM2239 mutant competed against the STM2234 - STM2237 mutant produced a CI of 0.726 0.189 , indicating that the STM2239 mutant on its own is less fit than the four - gene mutant ( Fig. 2D ) .
These experiments suggested that STM2239 has an influence on genes outside SPI - 12 that may impact fitness .
Gentamicin protection assays were conducted with each of the mutant strains to test their ability to replicate in tissue culture 2398 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity Mapping and Regulation of SPI - 12 A 12 10 ChIP Score 8 6 4 2 B 0 bp oafA STM2233 STM2234 STM2235 STM2236 STM2237 cont wt ∆ ssrB ∆ 2239 STM2238 C STM2239 STM2240 STM2239 sspH2 STM2242 1000 wt ∆ PsspH2 500 DnaK 100 HA FIG 5 SsrB regulates STM2239 expression via transcriptional read - through from the sspH2 promoter .

Of all seven mutants tested , the STM2234 - STM2240 and STM2239 strains were deficient at 20 h postinfection ( Fig. 3A ) , which we were able to complement when STM2239 was provided on a plasmid ( Fig. 3B ) .
These results indicate that four bacteriophage genes from the SPI - 12 remnant phage island contributed to S. Typhimurium fitness in a host and that STM2239 showed the most profound fitness defect both systemically and during intracellular replication in - vitro .
SsrB influences transcriptional regulation of SPI - 12 bacteriophage genes .
Having established a fitness contribution for phage genes within SPI - 12 , we next focused on the regulation of this locus .
Our previous work showed that gene expression in SPI - 12 decreased in an SsrB mutant ( 19 ) .
To test the regulatory sequences in SPI - 12 directly , chromosomal - galactosidase transcriptional reporters were generated for three intergenic regions ( IGR ) in SPI - 12 ( designated I , II , and III ) ( Fig. 4A ) .
In these experiments , - galactosidase activity from IGR - I and IGR - III was decreased in an SsrB mutant compared to the wild type , whereas IGR - II showed similar activities in wild - type and ssrB cells ( Fig. 4B ) .
To confirm that SsrB influenced the transcript levels of the phage genes within SPI - 12 , we measured specific mRNA levels by RT - PCR .
The rRNA methyltransferase gene , rsmC , was used as an internal control , and the SPI - 12 gene sspH2 was used as a positive control , as it is regulated by SsrB ( 21 , 32 , 33 ) .
All six phage genes showed decreased transcript levels that were comparable to those of the sspH2 control , while mRNA levels for STM2238 were unaffected by the loss of ssrB ( Fig. 4C ) .
Protein levels were verified using chromosomal HA fusions for each of the six phage genes .
Of the six phage proteins tested , only four were expressed under these conditions ( STM2234 , STM2235 , STM2236 , and STM2239 ) , and each of these was decreased in an ssrB mutant compared to the wild type , in agreement with the reporter and RT - PCR data ( Fig. 4D ) .
These data indicate that SsrB plays a role in regulating the expression of STM2234 , STM2235 , STM2236 , and STM2239 .
SsrB regulates SPI - 12 phage genes by transcriptional readthrough from the sspH2 promoter .
Having established that SsrB influences transcriptional regulation of phage genes within SPI - 12 , we wanted to determine whether SsrB acted directly or indirectly on this locus .
Our previous work mapping SsrB binding sites showed that despite transcriptional and translational data supporting a role for SsrB - dependent regulation at the STM2237 promoter , there was no SsrB binding site directly upstream of STM2237 ( Fig. 5A ) ( 19 ) .
There was , however , a prominent SsrB interaction site at the sspH2 promoter , implying possible transcriptional read - through from this promoter to STM2240 and STM2239 .
To investigate this possibility , cDNA generated from RNA isolated from wild - type , ssrB , and STM2239 strains was used as the template for PCR designed to amplify the IGR that resides between STM2240 and sspH2 .
Primers were designed to amplify from within sspH2 21 bp from the 3 = end of the coding sequence into the first 7 bp of the 5 = coding sequence of STM2240 .
PCR products were observed for cDNA from the wild type and the STM2239 mutant but not from the ssrB mutant ( Fig. 5B ) .
These data demonstrate that a transcript spanning sspH2 and STM2240 was produced and that SsrB was necessary for production of this transcript .
Additionally , we evaluated the expression of STM2239 in an sspH2 promoter deletion mutant strain ( P sspH2 ) .
Deletion of P sspH2 resulted in loss of STM2239 expression ( Fig. 5C ) , which is consistent with STM2240 and STM2239 transcription by SsrB via transcriptional read - through from the sspH2 promoter .

Having established a role for STM2234 , STM2235 , STM2236 , and STM2239 in S. Typhimurium pathogenesis , we next explored possible functions for these proteins .
BLAST analysis showed that these genes are most similar to other bacteriophage genes typically encoded in the late operon of lysogenic phage , summarized in Table 1 .
STM2239 is similar to Q - like antiterminators that facilitate transcriptional activation of the late operon in temperate phage during bacteriophage assembly ( 34 ) .
We investigated this potential function for STM2239 in SPI - 12 by examining the transcriptional profile of a strain overexpressing STM2239 .
The results from these experiments indicated that the genes most influenced by STM2239 overexpression are in SPI - 12 , followed by a subset of genes involved in various metabolic pathways ( Table 2 ) .
These include genes involved in ribose modification and transport , acetyl coenzyme A ( acetyl - CoA ) synthesis and recycling , and galactose metabolism .
We evaluated whether STM2239 directly influenced transcriptional activation at the STM2237 promoter .
Activity of a P STM2237 - galactosidase transcriptional reporter was measured in an STM2239 mutant , showing a loss of transcriptional activity compared to the wild type that was similar to that seen in the ssrB mutant ( Fig. 6A ) .
Evaluation of mRNA levels of SPI - 12 genes in the wild type and the STM2239 mutant showed a decrease for the genes in the STM2237 operon but no difference in the other genes tested ( Fig. 6B ) .
Moreover , protein levels for STM2234 , STM2235 , and STM2236 were diminished in an STM2239 mutant similar to the case for the ssrB mutant ( Fig. 6C ) .
These data indicate that STM2239 is a transcriptional regulator of the STM2237 operon .
STM2239 copurifies with the STM2237 promoter .
In order to provide further evidence that STM2239 functions as a Q antiterminator protein , chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) was performed to determine whether STM2239 copurifies with the STM2237 promoter .
PCR showed that the STM2237 promoter region was enriched following chromatin immunoprecipitation with STM2239 ( Fig. 7A ) .
We mapped the transcriptional start site of STM2237 using 5 = random amplification of cDNA ends ( 5 = RACE ) and identified a transcriptional start site at 198 bp from the translational start ( Fig. 7B ) .
Examination of the sequence surrounding the 1 site identified putative 10 and 35 70 elements as defined by Hawley and McClure , though no definitive Q utilization ( qut ) site was found ( 35 ) .
These data indicate that STM2239 may function as a DNA - binding protein to influence transcriptional activation and expression of the genes within the STM2237 operon .
DISCUSSION We characterized the fitness contribution and regulatory mechanisms associated with the bacteriophage genes in SPI - 12 .
We established that SsrB plays an indirect role in activating genes within this locus by transcriptional read - through from the sspH2 promoter .
Previous work showed that an sspH2 mutant is not attenuated during infection of mice ( 21 ) .
Rather , deletion of STM2239 , a putative Q - like antiterminator , accounted for the fitness defect in mice following loss of SPI - 12 .
Q antiterminators are transcriptional regulatory proteins that facilitate the activation and elongation at the late operon in lambdoid phages ( 36 ) .
Their expression is tightly controlled by other transcriptional regulators that are inactivated when the phage initiates the lytic cycle .
Q itself then interacts with a qut on the chromosome , which generally overlaps with the 10 site of the P R = late operon promoter ( 37 , 38 ) .

The SPI - 12 locus in S. Typhimurium is a remnant prophage with substantial genomic degradation .
As such , the intrinsic terminators that may have been present to regulate this locus appear to have been lost over time , as there is no evidence of terminator sequences upstream of either STM2240 or STM2237 .
Loss of the terminators at this locus has permitted integration of the phage genes STM2240 and STM2239 into the SsrB regulon through transcriptional read - through from the sspH2 promoter .
Our data are consistent with a model where STM2239 has maintained its function as a Q antiterminator pro- A IP : wild type 2239 - FLAG SsrB - FLAG 2239 - FLAG 2239 - FLAG Target : PSTM2237 xerD PsseI PsseI PSTM2237 + W E W E W E W E W E B 198 nts -35 -10 +1 attaaaaatcattaacgcggtccgcaaaaattcttgtaatctgctaagagtggtta ... ctacaaatgcctcat FIG 7 STM2239 copurifies with the STM2237 promoter .

START 2402 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity Mapping and Regulation of SPI - 12 tein by facilitating transcriptional activation of the adjacent gene cluster STM2234 - STM2237 .
The SPI - 12 remnant phage locus has been linked to intracellular survival of Salmonella .
Transposon mutagenesis studies investigating genes important for S. Typhimurium survival in macrophages identified a Tn10 insertion at this locus ( 41 , 42 ) .
This Tn10 insertion , MS5076 , was mapped to STM2234 and STM2235 , which likely encode tail fiber assembly and tail fiber proteins , respectively .
A similar mutagenesis approach looking for SsrB - regulated genes also identified an insertion at this same site , which was named SsrB - regulated factor K ( srfK ) ( 11 ) .
At this point , no specific function has been determined for STM2234 and STM2235 .
Phage tail fiber proteins contribute to pathogen - specific functions in other organisms .
For example , PblA and PblB in Streptococcus mitis function as platelet adhesins that allow S. mitis to adhere to human platelets during infective endocarditis ( 43 -- 45 ) .
They have also been adapted for use as the target - specific component of a subset of bacteriocins whose protein structures resemble bacteriophage tails .
Examples include the carotovoricins of the plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora and the R - and F - type pyocins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 46 -- 48 ) .
Of the additional phage genes in SPI - 12 , STM2236 is similar to a head maturation protease , while STM2237 appears to be a hybrid of a holin protein and a portal protein , which may explain why we could not find evidence of STM2237 protein expression despite confirmation of gene expression .
The integration of these genes into the SsrB regulon and the attenuation of strains in which certain SPI - 12 genes were deleted suggest that these bacteriophage gene products may contribute in some way to the pathogenicity of the strains that carry them .
The SPI - 12 locus is largely specific to S. Typhimurium , with only a few other sequenced serovars carrying the genes within it .
Further studies with other SPI - 12 - containing serovars such as S. Heidelberg and S. Paratyphi B would be required to establish whether they exhibit a similar regulatory cascade involving SsrB .
The inclusion of the Q - like antiterminator protein STM2239 into the SsrB regulatory cascade is intriguing .
Shiga toxin is regulated by Q proteins in the associated prophage , although transcriptional activation is mediated by induction of the phage lytic cycle in enterohemorrhagic E. coli ( EHEC ) during host infection ( 49 , 50 ) .
The extent to which STM2239 directs regulation outside SPI - 12 remains to be determined , although competition studies suggest that it does so .
When STM2239 is overexpressed , the majority of genes with altered transcription in LB - medium at mid - log phase have roles in metabolism , and some have been implicated in Salmonella fitness within the host .
For instance , SpeF , an ornithine decarboxylase , was shown to play a role in sensing low pH and delaying Salmonella - containing vacuole ( SCV ) acidification ( 51 ) .
Additionally , the acetate kinase encoded by ackA was found to contribute to formate production , which plays a role during SPI - 1 - mediated Salmonella invasion ( 52 ) .
This work highlights a case in which bacteria improve within - host fitness by using regulatory connections with prophage genes .
