171 , No. 6 Role of Homocysteine in metR - Mediated Activation of the metE and metH Genes in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli MARK L. URBANOWSKI AND GEORGE V. STAUFFER * Department of Microbiology , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa 52242 The metR - mediated activation of the Salmonella typhimurium metE and metH genes was shown to be modulated by homocysteine , an intermediate in the methionine biosynthetic pathway .
Homocysteine stimulates expression of a metE - lacZ gene fusion four - to fivefold by increasing transcription from the metE promoter .
In contrast , homocysteine plays an inhibitory role in the metR - mediated activation of the metH gene , decreasing expression of a metH - lacZ gene fusion threefold .
In Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , the last step in the formation of methionine involves the methylation of homocysteine ( for a review , see reference 14 ) .
This reaction is catalyzed either by a vitamin - B12 - dependent transmethylase , the metH gene product , or by a vitamin B12 - independent transmethylase , the metE gene product .
The availability of the vitamin cofactor determines which transmethylase is expressed , since the MetH - B12 holoenzyme represses metE gene expression ( 6 , 8 ) .
In addition to this specific MetH - B12 repression , the metE gene is also repressed by the metJ gene product , the general repressor of the met regulon .
Both the metE and metH genes require an activator protein , the metR gene product , in order to be efficiently expressed ( 19 ) .
Using metE - lacZ and metH - lacZ gene fusions to assess gene expression , we show in this paper that metR - mediated activation of the metE and metH genes is modulated by homocysteine .
Our data suggest that homocysteine stimulates the expression of the metE gene at the level of transcription and thus is similar to many other activator - dependent systems in which the presence of the substrate of the enzyme signals the induction of the gene encoding that enzyme ( 13 ) .
In contrast , our data indicate that homocysteine inhibits activation of the metH gene .
The role of homocysteine in determining which of two alternative transmethylases is expressed is discussed .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and bacteriophages .
All bacterial strains used are derivatives of E. coli K - 12 and are described in Table 1 .
The construction of X bacteriophage carrying either the S. typhimurium metE - lacZ gene fusion ( XElac ) or the S. typhimurium metH - lacZ gene fusion ( XHlac ) have been described elsewhere ( 12 , 18 ) .
The glucose minimal ( GM ) medium is the GM medium described previously ( 16 ) plus phenylalanine ( 50 jig/ml ) and vitamin - B1 ( 1 , ug/ml ) .
L - Methionine and D - methionine were added where indicated to a final concentration of 50 , ug/ml .
DL - Homocysteine was prepared by dissolving DL - homocysteine - thiolactone ( 20 mg/ml ) in 0.01 M NaOH for 15 min at 20 °C and then neutralizing with an equal volume of 0.005 M HCI ; the resulting 10 - mg/ml stock solution of DL - homocysteine was added to a final concentration of 100 , ug/ml .
L - Cystathionine was added to a final concen - * tration of 100 , ug/ml .
Vitamin B12 was added where indicated to a final concentration of 1 jig/ml .
Construction of the A lysogens .
Bacterial strains were lysogenized with either the AElac or the XHlac bacteriophage by a previously described procedure ( 17 ) .
After purification , lysogens were tested for the presence of only a single copy of A phage by testing their ability to support lytic infection by K c190 c17 ( 15 ) .
3 - Galactosidase enzyme activity was assayed as described in Miller ( 11 ) by using the chloroform - sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis procedure .
DNA manipulation and Sl nuclease mapping .
Restriction enzyme digestion and the isolation and 32p labeling of the DNA probe fragment were as described in Maniatis et al. ( 9 ) .
The G - sequencing reaction and polyacrylamide sequencing gel electrophoresis were performed as described by Maxam and Gilbert ( 10 ) .
The Si nuclease mapping procedure of Weaver and Weissmann ( 20 ) was used with minor modifications to assess the transcriptional activity of the metE - lacZ gene fusion .
A 320 - base - pair EcoRI - BamHI DNA restriction fragment containing the metE control region from the metElacZ fusion plasmid pGS125 ( 12 ) was labeled at both 5 ' ends with 32p , the two strands were separated on a polyacrylamide gel , and the strand complementary to the metE - lacZ transcript was identified by DNA sequencing and used as a probe .
Total cellular RNA was isolated as previously described ( 1 ) from either lysogen 719XElac or 761XElac grown in GM medium plus D - methionine and either with or without a homocysteine supplement .
g portion of total cellular RNA from each culture was precipitated along with a portion of the 32P - labeled DNA probe .
The mixtures were suspended in 20 , u1 of hybridization buffer -LCB- 0.4 M NaCl , 0.04 M PIPES [ piperazine - N , N ' - bis ( 2 - ethanesulfonic - acid ) ; pH 6.4 ] , 1 mM EDTA -RCB- , heated to 90 °C for 2 min , and then allowed to hybridize at 55 °C for 1 h .
I portion of cold S1 nuclease buffer ( 0.25 M NaCI , 0.06 M sodium acetate [ pH 4.6 ] , 1 mM ZnSO4 , 5 % glycerol ) containing 300 U of Si nuclease was added , and digestion was carried out at 20 °C for 1 h .
The S1 nuclease - resistant products were then precipitated and electrophoresed alongside a sequencing ladder of the DNA probe .
RESULTS Effects of methionine intermediates on metE expression .
Previous experiments showed that expression of the metE and metH genes in S. typhimurium and E. coli is dependent on the metR gene product ( 19 ) .

In addition to the relevant markers , all strains carry the pheA905 , thi , AlacU169 , araD129 , and rpsL mutations .
AmetF : : Mu and AmetR : : Mu were constructed by isolating Mu cts insertions in the metF and metR genes .
To stabilize the new mutations , we selected for temperature - resistant derivatives at 42 °C that have the same characteristics as the parent strains .
adenine SAM - dependent suggested that MetR activation of the metE and metH genes is mediated by one or more of the intermediates in methionine biosynthesis .
We examined the effects of these intermediates on metE and metH gene expression by using metE - lacZ and metH - lacZ gene fusions carried on X phage integrated into the bacterial chromosome .
To manipulate the in - vivo levels of intermediates in methionine synthesis , we constructed mutants of E. coli blocked at multiple points in the methionine pathway so that interconversion of exogenously added intermediates could not occur .
The addition of homocysteine to mutants blocked in the nonfolate branch of the pathway ( Fig. 1 ) overcomes the methionine auxotrophy in these strains , restoring adequate endogenous methionine production .
Since the comparison of the effects of this exogenously added intermediate on metE gene activation is confounded by the unequal MetJ repression in an auxotroph versus a prototroph , we inactivated the metJ - encoded repressor in these strains .
Strain GS720 carries mutations in the metJ , metB , and metC genes and is unable to produce the nonfolate intermediates cystathionine and homocysteine ; in addition , this strain would be expected to accumulate the folate intermediate 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate ( 5 - mTHF ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
Strain GS723 also carries mutations in the metJ , metB , and metC genes and in addition carries a metF mutation ; thus this strain is defective in the production of not only cystathionine and homocysteine but also 5 - mTHF .
When supplemented with limiting amounts of methionine , however , both strains could produce limited amounts of homocysteine from the utilization of S - adenosylmethionine via a regenerative pathway ( Fig. 1 ) that exists in E. coli ( 5 ) .
These strains were used to test the effects of cystathionine or homocysteine supplementation on metE and metH gene expression .
Although the first nonfolate intermediate in the methionine pathway , O - succinylhomoserine , can not be taken up by cells when it is added to the growth medium , strains GS720 and GS723 supplemented with only D - methionine ( which serves as a limiting source of L - methionine ) would be expected to accumulate high levels of this intermediate due to the metB mutation .
Similarly , the folate intermediate 5 - mTHF can not be taken up by cells when added to the growth medium , but its effect can be determined by comparing metE and metH gene expression in GS720 , which accumulates 5 - mTHF , with that in GS723 , which does not .
A Xgt2 phage carrying a S. typhimurium metE - lacZ gene fusion ( XElac ) ( 12 ) was used to lysogenize strains GS720 and GS723 .
In these lysogens , 720AElac and 723XElac , respectively , synthesis of 3 - galactosidase is directed by the control region of the S. typhimurium metE gene .

Methionine biosynthetic pathway in E. coli and S. typhimurium ( 3 ) .
The nonfolate branch includes the enzymes encoded by the metA , metB , and metC genes .
The folate branch includes the metF and glyA gene products and provides the methyl group added to homocysteine to form methionine ; this transmethylation reaction is catalyzed by either the metE or the metH gene product .
The methionine formed is used in protein synthesis or can be further modified to S - adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) , a principal methyl donor in many cellular methylation reactions .
The S - adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH ) formed as a by - product of these S - adenosylmethioninedependent methylation reactions can be salvaged as the adenine base and homocysteine by the cyclic regenerative branch of the pathway ( 5 ) , which has not been well characterized genetically .
nine or with D - methionine plus either homocysteine or cystathionine .
Cystathionine addition to the growth medium of lysogen 72OXElac had no significant effect ; however , the addition of homocysteine to the growth medium resulted in a four - to fivefold increase in metE - lacZ expression ( Table 2 ) .
In contrast , lysogen 723AElac no longer required homocysteine supplementation for maximum activation of metE - lacZ expression .
The high constitutive expression ( with respect to homocysteine ) of the metE - lacZ fusion caused by the metF mutation in lysogen 723AElac suggests two possibilities : either the metF gene product itself or 5 - mTHF functions directly to negatively regulate metE expression , or alternatively , the loss of 5 - mTHF indirectly leads to high metE expression by preventing the utilization of homocysteine , thus allowing accumulation of the homocysteine formed at a low rate through the regenerative pathway discussed above ( Fig. 1 ) .
To distinguish between these two possibilities , we constructed two additional strains , GS719 ( metJ metB ) and GS747 ( metJ metB metE ) .
The metE mutation in strain GS747 blocks homocysteine utilization but , unlike 723XElac , VOL .

allows the production of the metF gene product and 5 - mTHF .
Both strains were lysogenized with XElac , and the expression of the metE - IacZ fusion in these lysogens was compared with that seen in lysogen 723XElac ( Table 2 ) .
Lysogen 747Xflac showed high constitutive P - galactosidase synthesis similar to the high constitutive levels seen in 723AElac .
Siflc , e lysogen 747XElac would be expected to have relatively high levels of both the metF gene product and 5 - mTHF , these two agents probably do not act directly in negatively regulating metE expression .
Thus , the high constitutive metE - lacZ expression seen in 723XElac and 747XElac was most likely due to an accumulation of homocysteine .
This accumulation was probably a result of a lack of the transmethylase substrate 5 - mTHF in the former and a lack of the transmethylase enzyme itself in the latter .
Effect of homocysteine on metH expression .
To test whether homocysteine plays a similar role in the activation of metH gene expression by MetR , a Xgt2 phage carrying a S. typhimurium metH - lacZ fusion ( XHlac ) ( 18 ) was used to lysogenize strains GS719 , GS722 , and GS747 .
The lysogens 719XHlac , 722XHlac and 747XHlac , respectively , were grown in GM medium supplemented with either D - methionine or D - methionine plus homocysteine .
Surprisingly , the addition of homocysteine to the growth medium resulted in a threefold reduction of metH - IacZ expression in lysogen 719XHlac ( Table 3 ) .
Furthermore , in lysogen 722XHlac , metH - IacZ expression even in the absence of homocysteine was threefold lower than in lysogen 719XHlac .
This decrease in expression in 722XHlac was most likely due to an intracellular accumulation of homocysteine rather than to the loss of the metF gene product or 5 - mTHF , since the metE mutation in lysogen 747XHlac caused a similar drop in metH - IacZ expression .
Thus , although homocysteine played a stimulatory role in metE gene expression , this intermediate TABLE 3 .

had an inhibitory effect on metH gene expression .
It should be noted , however , that we have no evidence for a direct interaction of homocysteine with the MetR protein , and it is possible that homocysteine is first converted to or alters the level of a second metabolite outside the methionine biosynthetic pathway , which then serves as the signal - molecule .
Transcriptional regulation of metE .
The activation of expression of the metH gene by the metR gene product occurs at the level of transcription ( 18 ) .
To test whether activation of metE gene expression by the metR gene product also occurs at the transcriptional level and whether the homocysteine effect is dependent on a functional metR gene , we examined the effects of homocysteine and a metR mutation on the relative rates of metE - lacZ transcription .
Lysogens 719XElac ( metJ metB ) and 761XElac ( metJ metB metR ) were grown in GM medium supplemented with either D - methionine or D - methionine plus homocysteine .
The cultures were assayed for 3 - galactosidase activity , and a portion of each culture was used for the preparation of total cellular RNA .
The addition of homocysteine to the growth medium resulted in five - to sixfold - increased , B - galactosidase levels in lysogen 719XElac ( Table 2 ) .
In contrast , the metR mutation in lysogen 761AElac greatly decreased , - galactosidase levels and prevented activation of metE - lacZ expression by homocysteine supplementation to the growth medium .
To correlate P - galactosidase levels with metE - lacZ mRNA production , the relative levels of metE - lacZ transcription were determined by using an S1 nuclease assay procedure .
A 20 - , ug portion of total cellular RNA from each culture was hybridized to a 32P - labeled single - stranded DNA probe carrying the control region for the metE gene and the sequences complementary to the proximal end of the metE - lacZ transcript .
The hybridized fragments were then digested with Si nuclease , and the resulting Si nuclease - resistant products were analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel alongside a DNA sequencing ladder of the original probe ( Fig. 2 ) .
The addition of homocysteine to the growth medium resulted in significantly higher metE - lacZ mRNA production in lysogen 719XElac ( compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 ) .
In contrast , metE - lacZ mRNA production in the metR mutant lysogen 761XElac was not detected whether or not homocysteine was added to the growth medium ( Fig. 2 , lanes 3 and 4 ) .
Thus , the production of metE - lacZ mRNA paralleled P - galactosidase enzyme production in these lysogens , indicating that homocysteine stimulated metE gene expression at the level of transcription and that this transcriptionally regulated expression was dependent on the presence of a functional metR gene .
DISCUSSION We have shown that the activation of a S. typhimurium metE - lacZ fusion by the metR gene product was modulated by homocysteine , an intermediate in methionine biosynthesis .
This activation by the metR gene product and homocysteine ( or a related metabolite ) occurred at the transcriptional level ( Fig. 2 ) .
Although homocysteine stimulated metE - lacZ expression in lysogens 720AElac and 719XElac about four - to fivefold , this regulatory range was not nearly as wide as the 200 - fold range resulting from a metR mutation in the isogenic lysogen 761XElac ( Table 2 ) .
It is not clear from these experiments whether the MetR protein activates metE - lacZ expression in the absence of homocysteine and homocysteine modulates this basal activation over only a four - to fivefold range or whether the endogenous pool of homocys - 3280 URBANOWSKI AND STAUFFER G 2 3 4 I .
Transcriptional regulation of the metE - lacZ gene fusion by the metR gene product and homocysteine .
Lysogens 719XElac ( metJ metB ) and 761XElac ( metJ metB metR ) were grown in GM medium supplemented with either D - methionine or D - methionine plus homocysteine .
Part of each culture was assayed for 0 - galactosidase enzyme activity ( Table 2 ) , and the remainder was used to prepare total cellular RNA .
The RNA from each culture was hybridized to a 32P - labeled DNA probe containing the S. typhimurium metE control region and was digested with Si nuclease .
The S1 nuclease - resistant products ( arrow ) were sized on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel alongside the G - sequencing reaction products of the same DNA probe ( lane G ) .
Gel shows lysogen 719AElac grown without ( lane 1 ) or with ( lane 2 ) homocysteine and lysogen 761AElac grown without ( lane 3 ) or with ( lane 4 ) homocysteine .
teine produced from S - adenosylmethionine via the regenerative pathway ( Fig. 1 ) constitutes a sufficiently high level of the intermediate to potentiate metR activation in the absence of exogenously added homocysteine .
We are presently attempting to distinguish between these two hypotheses in two ways : ( i ) by isolating mutants blocked in the regenerative production of homocysteine , and ( ii ) by purifying the MetR protein to determine directly the effect of homocysteine on the expression of the metE gene in - vitro .
We considered the possibility that since the metE - lacZ fusion contained only 35 to 40 base pairs of DNA upstream of the -35 region of the metE promoter ( 12 ) , cis - acting contlol elements further upstream may have been missing .
Such upstream control elements have been shown to downregulate the positively controlled araBAD operon ( 7 ) .
If similar cis - acting elements exist for metE expression , their absence could explain the high levels of metE - lacZ expres - J. BACTERIOL .
sion in the absence of exogenously added homocysteine .
To address this question , we constructed a second metE - lacZ fusion that included a large ( -1,000 - base - pair ) region upstream of metE , including the entire metR gene .
The expression of this new metE - lacZ gene fusion was identical to that seen with the original metE - lacZ fusion ( data not shown ) , indicating that the full complement of cis - acting regulatory elements is present on the original XElac fusion phage .
It seems logical that the bacterial cell would induce the synthesis of the MetE enzyme when its substrate , homocysteine , begins to accumulate .
However , we find it curious that homocysteine played an antagonistic role in metH activation ( Table 3 ) , since homocysteine is also the substrate for the MetH transmethylase .
E. coli normally finds itself in a gut environment with sufficient vitamin - B12 for methionine production via the MetH - B12 transmethylase and for repression of the alternate MetE transmethylase ( 2 ) .
Since the MetH enzyme requires vitamin - B12 for activity , if the cell is shifted to an environment limiting in vitamin - B12 , the loss of MetH transmethylase efficiency would lead to methionine insufficiency .
At that point , derepression of the other met genes due to methionine limitation would increase homocysteine levels .
This increase in homocysteine may signal the cell that the MetH enzyme is no longer a viable transmethylase and that its synthesis should be down - regulated , while synthesis of the alternate MetE enzyme should be induced .
Consistent with this hypothesis are the results of Dev and Harvey ( 4 ) , who examined the intracellular levels of homocysteine in a metE mutant grown in methionine - limited and in vitamin B12 - limited chemostat cultures .
Homocysteine levels were eight - to ninefold higher in the vitamin - B12 - limited cultures , even though both culture conditions presumably limit growth by limiting intracellular methionine pools .
Although in these experiments the mechanism responsible for the increase in homocysteine was not identified , similar increases were also seen in the levels of S - adenosylhomocysteine and S - ribosylhomocysteine .
It is possible that a regulatory link exists between the regenerative branch of the methionine pathway and the folate and nonfolate branches .
