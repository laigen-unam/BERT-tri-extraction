In the absence of a host , S. enterica induces Sip secretion in response to sucrose or simple salts , such as NaCl .
We analyzed induction of host - independent Sip secretion by monitoring protein secretion by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) , assembly of needle complexes by electron microscopy , and transcription of virulence regulatory genes by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR ( real - time PCR ) .
SDS - PAGE showed that addition of sucrose or simple salts , such as NaCl , to the growth medium induced Sip secretion without altering flagellar protein secretion , which requires a distinct T3SS .
Electron microscopy confirmed that the amount of secreted Sips increased as the number of assembled needle complexes increased .
Real - time PCR revealed that added sucrose or NaCl enhanced transcription of hilA , hilC , and hilD , which encode known regulators of Salmonella virulence .
However , epistasis analysis implicated HilD and HilA , but not HilC , in the direct pathway from the salt stimulus to the Sip secretion response .
Further analyses showed that the BarA/SirA two - component signal transduction pathway , but not the two - component sensor kinase EnvZ , directly activated hilD and hilA transcription and thus Sip secretion in response to either sucrose or NaCl .
Finally , real - time PCR showed that salt does not influence transcription of the BarA/SirA - dependent csrB and csrC genes .
A model is proposed for the major pathway in which sucrose or salt signals to enhance virulence gene expression .
Animal pathogens , such as Salmonella , pathogenic Escherichia coli , Shigella , orYersinia spp. , secrete virulence proteins into hosts using specialized protein secretion systems called type III secretion systems ( T3SS ) ( 21 ) .
Different species regulate T3SS differently .
For instance , the level of type III secretion from Shigella spp. remains low until secretion is triggered by close contact with host tissues in - vivo , a process that can be mimicked by low - speed centrifugation of a mixture of bacterial and host cells ( 50 ) or by addition of Congo red to bacterial cells ( 6 , 36 ) .
On the other hand , type III secretion from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is triggered by interaction with a host or by manipulation of the growth - conditions ( 14 ) .
Under physiological conditions , S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells spontaneously secrete significant amounts of proteins into the medium .
In one study , for example , 80 % of the secreted proteins ( called Sip proteins or Sips ) were found in the infection medium ( 13 ) .
Among these secreted proteins , five flagellar proteins ( flagellin , hook protein , and three hook - associated proteins ) and five virulence - factors ( SipA , SipB , SipC , SipD , and InvJ ) are abundant enough to stain with Coomassie brilliant blue ( 29 ) .
Secretion of these two groups of proteins is facilitated by a subset of the flagellar genes ( 2 , 37 ) and by a Prefectural University of Hiroshima , 562 Nanatsuka , Shobara , Hiroshima 727 - 0023 , Japan .

subset of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) genes ( 24 ) , respectively .
Each subset of genes encodes a distinct T3SS that has common structural features ( 1 , 22 ) .
The regulatory network responsible for ensuring proper expression , assembly , and function of the flagellar T3SS has been well established ( 2 , 35 ) .
In contrast , the network responsible for controlling expression , assembly , and function of the SPI1 T3SS is still being actively investigated .
It is quite clear that HilA is the proximal activator of SPI1 genes ( 4 , 7 , 8 , 26 , 33 , 34 , 43 , 49 ) and that hilA transcription is controlled by two other regulators , HilD and HilC ( 3 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 19 , 37 , 39 , 41 , 42 , 47 , 52 ) .
These regulators , in turn , have been reported to be controlled by four two - component signal transduction pathways .
PhoQ - PhoP and PhoR - PhoB both activate hilE , which encodes an inhibitor of hilD ( 9 ) ; EnvZ - OmpR activates hilD ( 32 , 38 ) ; and BarA - SirA activates hilD , hilC , and hilA ( 31 , 48 ) .
How the BarA - SirA pathway activates SPI1 is controversial ; it has been proposed that BarA - SirA acts directly on hilC and hilA but indirectly through the Csr system to activate hilD ( 30 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
Although the flagellar and SPI1 regulatory networks are generally independent of each other , evidence showing some coordinated expression has accumulated .
In S. enterica serovar Typhimurium , for example , expression of virulence genes is regulated by fliZ , which encodes a flagellar activator ( 25 ) .
In S. enterica serovar Typhi , SPI1 gene expression depends on the flagellar sigma factor FliA ( 16 ) .
Moreover , flagellar and SPI1 genes are reciprocally regulated by the rtsA and rtsB genes ( 17 , 18 ) .
Fis , a DNA binding protein , is required for full expression 4624 VOL .

of both SPI1 genes and flagellar genes ( 28 , 52 ) .
Finally , the ATP - dependent protease Lon cleaves the SPI1 regulators HilC and HilD and the flagellar master regulator FlhC - FlhD , resulting in suppression of both systems ( 11 , 12 , 45 , 46 , 47 ) .
Many environmental factors have been reported to influence SPI1 gene expression and/or Sip secretion , including low oxygen tension , neutral pH , acetate and other short - chain fatty acids , cationic peptides , and bile ( 4 ) .
To the best of our knowledge , only two reports have directly addressed the effect of osmolarity on SPI1 gene expression .
Galan and Curtiss ( 23 ) explored the effect of high concentrations of salt ( 300 mM and higher ) and concluded that the osmoinducibility of invA depends on changes in DNA supercoiling but not on the osmoregulator ompR , while Bajaj and coworkers ( 8 ) showed that osmolarity indirectly activates SPI1 gene expression and that the process is mediated by HilA .
In this paper , we carefully document enhanced Sip secretion in response to exposure to diverse salts and sucrose and a wide range of NaCl concentrations .
In the process , we identify two distinct responses , one response that occurs upon exposure to high concentrations of salt and appears to involve DNA supercoiling and another response that occurs upon exposure to lower concentrations .
We further demonstrate that the latter response requires several of the known SPI1 regulators , most notably HilA and HilD .
We also show that this response requires the BarA - SirA two - component signal transduction pathway system .
We propose a simple model that can serve as a firm foundation upon which to base further studies of SPI1 regulation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and growth - conditions .
The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Mutant strains were derived mainly from SJW1103 , a wild - type strain of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium .
DW269 ( NK182 envZ : : Cm ) was a kind gift from Linda Kenny .
The envZ , barA , and sirA mutations were transferred into SJW1103 by P1 transduction ( 44 ) .
Except where indicated otherwise , cells were grown for 4hat37 °C in 5 ml of salt - free TY medium ( 1 % [ wt/vol ] tryptone and 0.5 % [ wt/vol ] yeast extract ) or TY medium supplemented with salts or sucrose at the indicated concentrations .
The proteins secreted into media were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) .
After the cells were removed by low - speed centrifugation ( 13,200 g for 20 min ) , 1 ml of each supernatant was placed into an Eppendorf tube , mixed with prechilled 25 % ( wt/vol ) trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) ( final concentration , 6 % ) , chilled on ice for 15 min , and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min .
The pellets were suspended with 0.3 ml of acetone and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min .
Acetone washing was repeated twice to remove all of the TCA from the precipitates .
Dry pellets were dissolved in SDS sample buffer .
SDS - PAGE was carried out using a minigel kit from Bio - Rad Laboratories , Inc. .
The acrylamide concentration of the gels was 12.5 % .
Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue .
Observation of osmotically shocked cells by electron microscopy .
Cells collected from 5 ml of culture were resuspended in 100 l of a sucrose solution ( 20 % [ wt/vol ] sucrose , 5 mM EDTA ; pH 7 ) .
After 5 min of incubation at room temperature , the suspension was abruptly diluted with 10 ml prechilled water .
Intact cells were removed by low - speed centrifugation , and the osmotically shocked cells that remained in the supernatant were collected by high - speed centrifugation ( 15,000 g , 20 min ) .
Samples were negatively stained with 2 % ( wt/vol ) phosphotungstic - acid ( pH 7.0 ) and observed with a JEM - 1200EXII electron microscope ( JEOL , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Micrographs were taken at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV .
Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR ( real - time PCR ) and calculation of relative expression levels .
All PCRs were performed using an Mx3000P quantitative PCR system ( Stratagene ) by following the manufacturer 's instructions .
For each PCR , the reaction mixture ( total volume , 25 l ) was prepared using Full - Velocity SYBR green quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR master mixture ( Stratagene ) with 0.1 g / l total RNA , 10 pmol of the PCR forward primer , 10 pmol of the PCR reverse primer , and the supplied ROX reference dye ( Stratagene ) .
The PCR cycling conditions were an initial denaturation step of 30 s at 95 °C , followed by 40 PCR cycles of denaturation for 10 s at 95 °C and annealing / extension for 30 s at 60 °C .
The relative amplification for expression of the genes in the presence of salt compared to that in a salt - free culture was automatically calculated .
RESULTS Rationale for in - vitro assay of T3SS .
The complex interaction between bacterial cells and host cells may involve both unknown chemicals and variable physical stimuli .

SDS - PAGE gel pattern of secreted proteins under various salt conditions .
( A ) Typical SDS - PAGE gel pattern of secreted proteins in the absence and presence of NaCl or sucrose for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium .
Secreted proteins were recovered from cell - free spent culture media by TCA precipitation .
Cells were grown in TY medium with no NaCl ( None ) , TY medium supplemented with 100 mM NaCl , or TY medium supplemented with 200 mM sucrose .
Each protein band was assigned to a flagellar protein ( left ) or a virulence protein ( right ) .
The molecular mass of each protein is indicated in parentheses .
( B ) An overnight culture in TY medium was transferred into fresh TY media containing various concentrations of NaCl , including 0 , 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 , 800 , and 900 mM .
NaCl concentrations up to 300 mM had no effect on the growth - rate or maximum cell density .
To standardize loading , the optical densities at 660 nm of the cultures at the time of harvest were 1.651 ( 0 mM ) , 1.677 ( 100 mM ) , 1.658 ( 200 mM ) , 1.590 ( 300 mM ) , 1.563 ( 400 mM ) , 1.566 ( 500 mM ) , 1.600 ( 600 mM ) , 1.561 ( 700 mM ) , 1.551 ( 800 mM ) , and 1.450 ( 900 mM ) .
difficult to dissect the signaling networks that control interaction - dependent behavior , such as the biogenesis of the T3SS , which bacteria use to secrete virulence proteins ( Sips ) into host cells .
It is known , however , that cells of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium grown in LB - medium secrete Sips even in the absence of host cells ( 14 , 29 ) .
Thus , we can study the regulation of secretion in a host - independent manner .
In such a system , we can control the nature and amount of chemicals and/or stimuli added exogenously .
We propose that results from such in - vitro experiments can reveal fundamental properties of the secretion system .
In this study , we investigated the effect of osmolarity on the expression of the SPI1 T3SS and dissected the pathway through which osmolarity exerts this effect .
In practice , we first analyzed secretion proteins by SDS - PAGE .
If Sip proteins were secreted as expected , we assumed that SPI1 genes were expressed normally and that the T3SS had formed successfully .
When Sip secretion was abnormal , we analyzed SPI1 gene expression by real - time PCR and observed T3SS by electron microscopy .
Increased osmolarity induces Sip secretion .
( i ) Sip secretion is NaCl dependent .
We routinely recovered secreted proteins from cell - free spent media that had been harvested following 4 h of incubation by TCA precipitation and analyzed these proteins by SDS - PAGE .
Protein bands were blotted on a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and analyzed by N - terminal amino - acid sequencing ( 29 ) .
When wild - type cells were grown in TY medium supplemented with 100 mM NaCl , the major proteins in each band were either flagellar proteins ( FlgK , FliC , FlgE , and FlgL ) or Sip proteins ( SipA , SipB , SipC , SipD , and InvJ ) ( Fig. 2A ) .
In contrast , when cells were grown in the absence of salt , they secreted only the flagellar proteins ( Fig. 2A ) .
The bands containing FlgE or SipC and the bands containing InvJ or SipD overlapped ; thus , band assignments were made cautiously .
The amount of flagellar protein secreted into the media varied from one protein to another and was not necessarily proportional to the amount required for formation of a structure .
We concluded that NaCl induces Sip secretion .
To optimize conditions for the study of NaCl - induced Sip secretion , we performed a dose dependence experiment .
The effect of NaCl was biphasic with respect to concentration ( Fig. 2B ) .
In the absence of NaCl , low levels of Sips were secreted .
As the NaCl concentration was increased up to 100 mM , the amounts of secreted Sips gradually increased ( Fig. 2B and data not shown ) .
At an NaCl concentration of 400 mM or higher , Sip secretion decreased gradually .
In contrast , the amounts of secreted flagellar proteins remained relatively constant at NaCl concentrations between 0 and 500 mM .
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium the flagellum - specific and SPI1 - specific T3SS systems are regulated independently , at least with regard to salt concentration .
In the presence of an NaCl concentration of 600 mM or higher , the intensities of the bands of both the Sip and flagellar proteins decreased , while many minor background bands appeared .
These results are consistent with global damage to secretion induced by high salt concentrations .
Such concentrations clearly inhibited growth ( data not shown ) , and microscopic examination revealed that the cells were motile but elongated like snakes .
We also observed similar abnormal secretion when cells were grown in the presence of 100 mM NaCl if a DNA - gyrase - inhibitor ( novobiocin or coumermycin A1 ) was also added ; growth was impaired , microscopic examination revealed elongated cells ( data not shown ) , and SDS - PAGE analysis revealed many minor background bands ( Fig. 3 ) .
The presence of 20 g/ml novobiocin resulted in a secreted protein profile similar to that observed with cells grown in the presence of 700 mM NaCl ( compare Fig. 3A and 2B ) .
Coumermycin A1 was more effective , resulting in a similar secreted protein profile at concentrations as low as 2 g/ml ( Fig. 3B ) .
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that high concentrations of NaCl hamper the normal function of DNA gyrase and thus reduce DNA superhelicity , as suggested previously ( 43 ) .
( ii ) Simple salts induce Sip secretion .
We next surveyed the effects of various salts on Sip secretion .
Cells were precultured in TY medium and inoculated into TY media containing the following salts at a concentration of 100 mM : NaCl , KCl , KBr , NH 4 Cl , CaCl 2 , MgCl 2 , MgSO 4 , Na 2 SO 4 , and ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 .
With one exception , these salts yielded a secreted protein profile that resembled the pattern produced in the presence of NaCl ( Fig. 4 ) .
The intensity of the bands produced in the presence of KCl , KBr , or MgCl 2 was generally similar to the intensity of the bands produced in the presence of NaCl .
The profile was generally less intense in the presence of NH 4 Cl , MgSO 4 , VOL .

Na 2 SO 4 , or ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 .
In contrast , CaCl 2 did not induce Sip secretion .
Thus , it appears that with the exception of CaCl 2 , the halogenated salts exerted a stronger effect than the sulfated salts .
For all further studies , we employed NaCl .
( iii ) Sucrose induces Sip secretion .
To determine if the salt effect results from changes in medium osmolarity , we examined Sip secretion in the presence of 200 mM sucrose .
The secretion profile ( Fig. 2A ) was similar but not identical to the profiles observed with NaCl ( Fig. 2A ) .
Whereas sucrose induced secretion of SipA and SipD/InvJ at levels that were similar to those observed in the presence of NaCl , the secretion of SipB and SipC was not nearly as strong .
We concluded that increased osmolarity induces SPI1 - dependent secretion .
NaCl induces needle complex assembly .
The SPI1 T3SS secretes Sips through a needle complex ( 24 , 27 ) that can be seen by electron microscopy .
We therefore employed electron microscopy to determine if salt influences the assembly of needle complexes .
Wild - type cells were grown in TY medium supplemented or not supplemented with 100 mM NaCl ; the final cell densities under the two conditions were similar , and FIG. 4 .
SDS - PAGE gel pattern of secreted proteins from TY culture media supplemented with various salts , including no salts , 100 mM NaCl , 100 mM KCl , 100 mM KBr , 100 mM NH 4 Cl , 100 mM CaCl 2 , 100 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM MgSO 4 , 100 mM Na 2 SO 4 , and 100 mM ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 .
Electron micrographs of osmotically shocked cells .
Cells grown in ( A ) TY medium without salt or ( B ) TY medium supplemented with 150 mM NaCl were osmotically shocked , stained with 2 % phosphotungstic - acid ( pH 7 ) , and observed by electron microscopy .
Only the cell surfaces are shown .
The arrowheads indicate needle complexes .
microscopic examination revealed no obvious morphological defects .
For electron microscopy , the cells were harvested from culture media , suspended in a sucrose solution , and shocked osmotically .
When cells were grown in the presence of 100 mM NaCl , about 70 % of the cells had about 50 to 100 needle complexes on the cell surface ( Fig. 5A ) .
In contrast , when they were grown in the absence of NaCl , the majority of the cells displayed only a few needle complexes ( Fig. 5B ) .
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the amount of secreted Sips correlates with the number of needle complexes per cell .
Increased osmolarity induces transcription of SPI1 regulators .
To identify the part of the proposed regulatory network ( Fig. 1 ) that controls needle complex assembly and Sip secretion in response to increased osmolarity , we used quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR ( real - time PCR ) to monitor transcription of known regulators of SPI1 genes .
We first examined transcription of the hilA gene , which directly regulates SPI1 gene expression ( 7 , 8 , 33 , 34 ) , and transcription of the hilC and hilD genes , which are known to positively regulate hilA ( 8 , 33 ) .
The presence of 100 mM NaCl increased the expression of hilA , hilC , and hilD nearly sixfold , threefold , and nearly fivefold , respectively .
In contrast , salt had little effect on hilE transcription ( Table 2 ) .
Similar results were observed when 100 mM NaCl was replaced with 200 mM sucrose ( data not shown ) .
These results are consistent with previous reports indicating that HilA , HilC , and HilD regulate SPI1 gene transcription and that HilC and HilD activate hilA transcription equally ( 3 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 19 , 33 , 34 , 37 , 40 , 41 , 47 , 49 ) .
To determine if the salt response required HilC and HilD equally , we performed an epistasis analysis .
We compared the wild - type Sip secretion profile to the secretion profile of mutant cells 4628 MIZUSAKI ET AL. .

defective for hilA , defective for either hilC or hilD , or defective for both hiC and hilD ( Fig. 6 ) .
The hilA , hilD , and hilC hilD mutants did not secrete Sips .
In contrast , the hilC mutant secreted Sip proteins about as well as its wild - type parent .
Accordingly , hilA , hilC , and hilD transcripts were barely detectable in hilD and hilC hilD mutants even in the presence of NaCl ( Table 3 ) .
In contrast , salt - activated transcription of the hilA and hilD genes was observed in the hilC mutant , although the levels were lower than those in the wild - type parent .
Electron microscopy showed that there were many needle complexes in the hilC mutant but few needle complexes in the hilA , hilD , and hilC hilD mutants ( data not shown ) .
We therefore propose that the salt signal passes through HilD to HilA and that HilC exerts a modulating effect on hilD and hilA transcription , but this modulating effect is not enough to influence the Sip secretion profile .
To test this model , we transformed a hilD mutant with a multicopy plasmid that carries the wild - type allele of hilA .
As a control , we also transformed a hilA mutant .
We then exposed the strains to salt and monitored hilA , hilD , and sipC transcription .
Relative to the wild type , the presence of the hilA plasmid increased hilA transcription 40 - and 70 - fold and sipC transcription 20 - and 30 - fold in the hilA and hilD mutants , respectively , even in the absence of salt ( Table 4 ) .

In the hilA mutant , which expressed HilD , exposure to salt increased hilA , hilD , and sipC transcription .
In the hilD mutant , exposure to salt had no effect on sipC transcription and caused a significant decrease in hilA transcription .
On the basis of these observations , we concluded that the salt signal acts on hilA transcription and thus transcription of SPI1 genes ( e.g. , sipC ) via HilD .
The BarA - SirA two - component system mediates the response to high - osmolarity .
The following four two - component signal transduction systems could affect hil gene expression : PhoQ - PhoP , PhoR - PhoB , EnvZ - OmpR , and BarA - SirA .
We could eliminate the PhoQ - PhoP pathway because these proteins activate hilE ( 9 ) and the presence of either 100 mM NaCl or 200 mM sucrose had no effect on the expression of hilE ( Table 2 and data not shown ) .
To test the involvement of the EnvZ - OmpR and BarA - SirA pathways , we compared the secretion profiles of barA and envZ mutants to the profile of their isogenic wild - type parent .
The barA and sirA mutants did not secrete Sips even in the presence of 100 mM NaCl ( Fig. 7 ) or 200 mM sucrose ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , the envZ mutant exhibited a secretion profile indistinguishable from that of the wild - type parent ( Fig. 7 and data not shown ) .
Consistent with these data , 100 mM NaCl induced hilA and hilD transcription in the envZ mutant but not in the barA and sirA mutants TABLE 4 .

Note that cells of wildtype strain 3306 and cells of its derivatives can produce either the FliC or FljB flagellin .
Under these conditions the hilA mutant secreted FliC flagellin , while the wild - type parent and the hilC , hilD , and hilC hilD mutants secreted the FljB flagellin .

Furthermore , electron microscopy revealed numerous needle complexes on the surface of the envZ mutant but not on the surface of the barA mutant ( data not shown ) .
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the BarA/SirA pathway , but not EnvZ , is intimately involved in salt - activated Sip secretion .
It is known that the BarA - SirA pathway activates transcription of the small csrB and csrC RNAs .
These small RNAs bind the protein CsrA ( 5 , 30 ) .
CsrA has been shown to inhibit hilD expression ( 30 ) .
We therefore tested if salt influences the transcription of csrA , csrB , and csrC ( Table 6 ) .
In contrast to hilA transcription , which exhibited a BarA - SirA - dependent response to 100 mM NaCl , csrA , csrB , and csrC transcription did not respond to salt even though transcription of csrB and csrC did depend on the BarA - SirA pathway , as reported previously ( 20 , 30 ) .
We concluded that the salt stimulus acts via the BarA - SirA pathway but not through the Csr system .
Second effect of salt .
The data presented thus far are consistent with a simple linear pathway in which BarA senses the salt/sucrose stimulus and transduces the information to SirA , which informs HilD , which activates hilA transcription , which permits HilA - dependent activation of SPI1 genes , including the T3SS and its Sips .
Alternatively , however , salt/sucrose may directly affect the conformation of intermediate regulatory TABLE 5 .
Real - time PCR for expression of T3SS - related regulatory genes : hilA and hilD gene expression in mutants deficient for barA , sirA , orenvZ proteins and thus modify their function .
Because plasmidborne hilA in the hilA mutant induced hilA , hilD , and sipC transcription independent of salt ( Table 4 ) , we reasoned that this strain could allow us to observe any transcription - independent salt effects .
Indeed , Sip secretion , which was completely inhibited in the hilA mutant , recovered in the presence of plasmid - borne HilA ( Fig. 8 ) .
Intriguingly , in the absence of salt , the secretion profile of this transformant resembled that of wild - type cells exposed to 200 mM sucrose ; the amount of secreted SipB and SipC was reduced in the absence of NaCl relative to the amount in the presence of NaCl ( Fig. 8 ) .
We propose that NaCl impacts Sip secretion in two distinct ways : ( i ) like sucrose , it induces SPI1 transcription via a pathway that includes BarA , SirA , HilD , and HilA ; and ( ii ) unlike sucrose , it enhances secretion of SipB and SipC .
DISCUSSION In this study , we showed that exposure to simple salts ( 100 mM ) and sucrose ( 200 mM ) specifically induces expression and assembly of the SPI1 - encoded T3SS and its associated needle complex and expression and secretion of SPI1 - encoded Sips .
Because Sip secretion occurred in response to a variety of salts and to sucrose , we propose that elevated osmolarity is the relevant environmental stimulus .

Osmolarity response pathway : a simple model .
To understand how cells respond to relatively low concentrations of salt ( 100 mM ) and sucrose ( 200 mM ) , we used genetic analyses to track the pathway through which salt activates Sip secretion .
On the basis of these studies , we propose the following model ( Fig. 9 ) .
In response to salt , the sensor kinase BarA autophosphorylates and donates its phosphoryl group to its cognate response regulator , SirA .
Phosphorylated SirA then activates transcription of a factor X , which is not the small csr RNAs .
Factor X activates hilD , which activates hilA .
The evidence for this simple model is as follows .
Exposure to salt or sucrose activated hilD , hilC , and hilA transcription ( Table 2 ) .
hilD , hilC , and hilA mutants did not secrete Sips in response to salt ( Fig. 6 ) .
This response depended on hilD and hilA but not on hilC ( Table 3 ) , supporting the hypothesis that HilC has an accessory role .
The barA and sirA mutants did not secrete Sips in response to either salt or sucrose , and hilA and hilD transcription depended on barA ( Fig. 7 and Table 5 ) .
In contrast , the envZ mutant secreted Sips and transcribed hilA and hilD as well as its wild - type parent ; thus , EnvZ plays a minor role in this pathway ( Fig. 7 and Table 5 ) .
Because exposure to salt or sucrose had no effect on hilE transcription ( Table 2 ) , it is unlikely that the salt/sucrose response involves the PhoQP and PhoRB pathways .
Second effect of salt .
Although sucrose and salt induced Sip secretion through the same pathway , the secretion profiles induced by sucrose and salt were not identical .
Although exposure to sucrose and exposure to salt resulted in detection of similar amounts of SipA and SipD , only exposure to salt resulted in detection of significant amounts of SipB and SipC ( Fig. 2A ) .
A possible reason for this discrepancy became apparent when we overexpressed HilA in a hilA mutant ( Table 4 ) .
This genetic manipulation bypassed the salt requirement for Sip secretion with two notable exceptions : SipB and SipC .
In the absence of salt , we detected small amounts of these two proteins .
In contrast , we detected substantial amounts of both proteins upon exposure to salt .
Since all four proteins are encoded in a single operon in the order sipBCDA , it is quite likely that they are expressed at similar levels .
Indeed , regardless of treatment , all four Sip proteins could be detected in the medium when they were harvested at earlier time points ( data not shown ) .
We therefore propose that SipB and SipC are expressed and secreted but are degraded during prolonged exposure to the medium .
