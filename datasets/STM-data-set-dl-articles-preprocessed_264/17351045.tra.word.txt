The Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium genome contains an impressive array of genetic determinants devoted to attachment , including some 13 fimbrial operons and three genes encoding adhesins of the autotransporter family , shdA , misL , and bigA ( 10 -- 12 , 15 , 23 , 34 ) .
Only two of the encoded adhesins are well expressed in - vitro , including type 1 fimbriae encoded by the fim operon ( 4 , 6 ) and thin curled fimbriae ( also known as thin aggregative fimbriae or curli ) encoded by the csg ( agf ) gene cluster ( 9 , 29 , 33 ) , but the expression of both adhesins is also subject to regulation .
The lack of in - vitro expression of the remaining adhesins has in many cases prevented their identification by methods other than sequence analysis .
The misL gene encodes an autotransporter protein of serotype Typhimurium and was identified during sequence analysis of a DNA region termed Salmonella pathogenicity island 3 ( SPI3 ) ( 3 ) .
Autotransporter proteins contain an N - terminal signal peptide , an internal passenger domain , and a C - terminal translocator domain .
Upon transport across the cytoplasmic membrane and cleavage of the signal peptide , the C - terminal translocator domain forms a - barrel in the outer membrane through which the passenger domain is exported to the cell surface ( 27 ) .
The MisL passenger domain enables serotype Typhimurium to bind fibronectin to its cell surface , resulting in attachment to fibronectin - coated glass slides and in increased invasiveness for human epithelial cells ( 5 ) .
An intact misL gene is required for intestinal colonization in chicks and mice inoculated orally with serotype Typhimurium ( 5 , 25 ) .
These data show that MisL is an extracellular matrix adhesin involved in intestinal colonization .
The MisL C - terminal translocator domain can be used to display foreign antigens and elicits specific antibody responses in mice ( 30 , 31 , 36 ) .
Mice infected with serotype Typhimurium seroconvert to MisL , which provides indirect evidence for in vivo expression of this autotransporter protein ( 5 ) .
Furthermore , expression of misL is induced upon serotype Typhimurium infection of macrophages in - vitro ( 7 ) .
However , after growth in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth , a misL - lac transcriptional fusion does not produce any - galactosidase activity , suggesting that the misL gene may be expressed in response to signals not present in laboratory media ( 3 ) .
Similarly , MisL expression is not detected by Western blotting in serotype Typhimurium grown in LB broth ( 5 ) .
Expression of the MisL protein can be detected with anti - MisL serum in LB broth cultures of serotype Typhimurium strains carrying a cloned misL gene whose expression is driven from the Escherichia coli arabinose promoter ( 5 ) .
These data suggest that inhibition of MisL expression during - growth of serotype Typhimurium in LB broth is mediated by transcriptional control mechanisms .
However , the regulatory elements that allow serotype Typhimurium to induce misL expression in - vivo are not known .
The goal of this study was to identify regulatory elements contributing to the control of MisL expression by screening a transposon library for mutants expressing a misL : : lacZYA transcriptional - fusion on LB agar plates .
Identification of T - POP insertions that trigger MisL expression in - vitro .
To identify genes controlling misL expression , we constructed a derivative of serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 ( 21 ) in which the promoterless lacZYA genes were chromosomally inserted behind the stop codon of the intact misL gene .
To this end , a derivative ( pCM2 ) of the suicide vector pFUSE ( 2 ) carrying the 5 end of the misL gene ( amplified with the primers 5 - GCTCTAGACTTGCCAACAACTATGC G - 3 and 5 - GCCCGGGCCTGAATCAGAAACTGTATTTC - 3 ) was transferred from E. coli strain S17 - 1 pir ( 32 ) into serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 by conjugation .
The resulting strain ( MA1 ) was used to generate a library of random T - POP insertion mutants .
To this end , a plasmid encoding the Tn10 transposase ( pNK972 ) ( 28 ) was introduced into serotype Typhimurium misL : : lacZYA ( MA1 ) .
A bacteriophage P22 derivative ( P22 HT105/1 int ) was grown on a serotype Typhimurium strain carrying the T - POP transposon on an E. coli F plasmid ( TH3923 ) ( 28 ) , and the resulting phage lysate was used to deliver the T - POP transposon into MA1 ( pNK972 ) .
Transductants were selected on LB agar plates containing tetracycline 3922 VOL .
( A ) Analysis by Western blotting of two T - POP mutants ( M - 1 , lane 1 ; M - 2 , lane 2 ) of serotype Typhimurium strain MA1 ( LT2 misL : : lacZYA ) that exhibited a `` blue '' colony phenotype on LB -- tetracycline -- X - Gal agar plates for expression of MisL .
Bacteria were grown in LB broth in the presence ( Tc ) or the absence ( Tc ) of tetracycline .
The presence of an approximately 100 - kDa protein band ( MisL ) in the mutants is indicated by an arrow .
( B ) Quantification of - galactosidase activity in T - POP mutants ( MA1 - 1 and MA1 - 2 ) of serotype Typhimurium strain MA1 ( LT2 misL : : lacZYA ) grown in LB broth in the presence ( open bars ) or the absence ( closed bars ) of tetracycline .
The bars represent averages from three independent measurements standard deviations .
( 20 mg/liter ) ( the resistance conferred by T - POP ) and X - Gal ( 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - - D - galactopyranoside ; 60 mg/liter ) ( to monitor activity of the misL : : lacZYA reporter ) .
Among approximately 40,000 transductants , we detected 21 colonies that were blue or light blue , suggesting expression of the misL : : lacZYA transcriptional - fusion .
These 21 candidates ( M - 1 to M - 21 ) were chosen for further analysis .
T - POP contains a tetracycline - dependent promoter that can drive expression of genes that are located adjacent to the transposon insertion .
T - POP mutagenesis can thus identify both negative regulatory elements ( by insertional inactivation ) and positive regulatory elements ( by driving their expression from the tetracycline - dependent promoter of T - POP ) .
Expression of MisL was not detected by Western blotting using anti- MisL serum ( 5 ) in any of the 21 mutants grown in LB broth .
However , after growth in LB broth supplemented with - tetracycline , a band of approximately 100 kDa was detected by Western blotting in two of the mutants , M - 1 and M - 2 ( Fig. 1 ) .
The size of this band corresponded well to the molecular mass of 98.4 kDa predicted for the mature MisL protein from its amino - acid sequence .
The fact that MisL expression was detected by Western blotting only after growth of M - 1 and M - 2 in medium containing tetracycline suggested that T - POP may be inserted upstream of a positive regulatory element in these mutants .
To further characterize the 21 candidates identified by T - POP mutagenesis , we determined the - galactosidase activities ( 24 ) of individual cultures grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline .
Expression of - galactosidase was detected at high levels ( between 100 and 300 Miller units ) only in M - 1 and M - 2 grown in the presence of tetracycline ( Fig. 1B ) .
The remaining 19 mutants did not express - galactosidase above background levels , and they were excluded from further analysis .
The T - POP insertions in strains M - 1 and M - 2 were transduced into a serotype Typhimurium misL : : lacZYA strain background , giving rise to strains MA1 - 1 and MA1 - 2 , respectively .
Expression of misL in MA1 - 1 and MA1 - 2 was tetracycline inducible , as shown by measuring - galactosidase activity and by detecting MisL expression by Western blotting ( data not shown ) .
These results confirmed that the phenotype ( i.e. , tetracycline - inducible misL expression in LB broth ) of both mutants was linked to their respective T - POP insertions .
DNA regions flanking the T - POP transposon insertion sites in strains MA1 - 1 and MA1 - 2 were cloned by inverse PCR ( 13 ) using the primer pair 5 - GCACTTGTCTCCTGTTTACTC C - 3 and 5 - CGCTTTTCCCGAGATCATATG - 3 for amplification .
PCR products were cloned into E. coli and DH5 ( 8 ) using the vector PCR2 .1 ( Invitrogen ) , and the respective nucleotide sequences were determined .
Sequence comparison using the BLAST algorithm at NCBI ( 1 ) revealed that the two insertions were at the same position within the marT open reading frame located upstream of nucleotide 7 ( relative to the marT start codon ) .
The insertion site was adjacent to the sequence 5 - GCTACGC - 3 ( 8 to 14 ) , which closely matched the Tn10 hot - spot consensus sequence ( 5 - GCTNAGC - 3 ) ( 19 ) , thereby providing a possible explanation for the identity of the T - POP insertion sites in strains MA1 - 1 and MA1 - 2 .
Alternatively , strains MA1 - 1 and MA1 - 2 may represent siblings , although this possibility appears less likely because delivery of T - POP by phage transduction does not provide bacteria with enough time to replicate prior to being spread on selective agar plates .
MarT activates expression of MisL .
The marT gene is located on SPI3 and encodes a protein of 285 amino - acids , which is most closely related ( 41 % sequence identity ) to the transcriptional activator CadC of E. coli ( 35 ) .
MarT contains a putative DNA - binding winged - helix - turn - helix domain between amino - acids - 32 and 180 .
The N - terminal 31 amino - acids of MarT are absent in CadC , but the two proteins share sequence identity over the remaining part of their primary structures .
The transposon insertions in strains MA1 - 1 and MA1 - 2 generated in each case a truncated marT open reading frame that was located downstream of the tetracycline - inducible tetA promoter of T - POP .
The marT open reading frame encodes a second ATG start codon ( at nucleotide positions 70 to 72 ) that may be used to initiate translation of a protein with a truncation of the first 21 amino - acids , thus leaving the putative DNA - binding winged - helix - turn - helix domain intact .
The tetracycline - inducible expression of misL in strains MA1 - 1 and MA1 - 2 raised the possibility that the tetA promoter might drive the expression of a truncated but functionally active MarT regulatory protein .
An alternative possibility was that the tetA promoter of T - POP might drive the expression of the downstream fidL gene , whose gene product in turn might activate misL expression .
FidL is a hypothetical inner membrane protein containing no conserved functional domains .
To test the hypothesis that strains MA1 - 1 and MA1 - 2 expressed MisL when grown in the presence of tetracycline because the tetA promoter of T - POP drove production of a functional MarT protein , we cloned marT into an expression vector ( pBAD/gIIIA ) behind an arabinose - inducible promoter using the primer pair 5 - GGAGCTCGGGGACAATCCATGTCCT GCTACG - 3 and 5 - GCTGCAGTTACCCATGTGTCACCC CGCGG - 3 .
The resulting plasmid ( pCT6 ) was introduced into serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 , and expression of MisL was 3924 NOTES J. BACTERIOL .
Detection of MisL expression in serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 by Western blotting .
A plasmid in which the arabinose promoter drives the expression of a promoterless marT gene ( pCT6 ) was introduced into strain LT2 , and the bacteria were grown in the presence of the L - arabinose concentrations indicated on the right .
The presence of an approximately 100 - kDa protein band corresponding to MisL is indicated by an arrow .
investigated by Western blotting .
An approximately 100 - kDa protein band was detected by Western blotting with anti - MisL serum only when serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 ( pCT6 ) was grown in the presence of arabinose ( Fig. 2 ) .
The 100 - kDa protein was not expressed in serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 lacking pCT6 .
These data suggested that expression of marT in serotype Typhimurium was sufficient to induce expression of the MisL protein .
To determine whether MarT activates transcription of the misL gene , plasmid pCT6 was introduced into serotype Typhimurium strain MA1 ( misL : : lacZYA ) .
A significant increase in - galactosidase activity was observed when strain MA1 ( pCT6 ) was grown in the presence of 0.02 % or 0.2 % L - arabinose ( Fig. 3 ) .
These data supported the idea that expression of marT FIG. 3 .
Expression of misL in serotype Typhimurium strain MA1 ( LT2 misL : : lacZYA ) detected by Western blotting ( right ) or by measuring - galactosidase activity ( left ) .
Strain MA1 was transformed with a plasmid carrying the promoterless marT gene cloned behind the arabinose promoter ( pCT6 ) , and the bacteria were grown in the presence of the L - arabinose concentrations indicated on the left .
The presence of an approximately 100 - kDa protein band in the Western blot , which corresponds to MisL , is indicated by an arrow .
Induction of MisL expression ( A ) and binding of the misL promoter region ( B ) by a GST - MarT fusion protein .
( A ) Western blot of serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 containing plasmid pGEX - 4T - 2 ( lane 1 ) or a plasmid encoding a GST - MarT fusion protein ( pCT17 ) ( lane 2 ) detected with anti - MisL serum .
The presence of an approximately 100 - kDa protein band in the Western blot , which corresponds to MisL , is indicated by an arrow .
( B ) EMSA with a biotin - labeled DNA fragment containing the misL promoter region .
Lanes 1 to 7 show biotin - labeled DNA in the absence of protein ( lane 1 ) or in the presence of increasing concentrations ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , and 7.5 g/lane ) of purified GST - MarT fusion protein ( lanes 2 to 7 ) .
Lane 8 contained GST - MarT in the absence of DNA .
from plasmid pCT6 was sufficient to induce transcription of the misL gene .
While MisL expression was detected by Western blotting after the growth of serotype Typhimurium LT2 ( pCT6 ) in 0.00002 % L - arabinose ( Fig. 2 ) , induction of misL expression in serotype Typhimurium strain MA1 ( pCT6 ) required considerably higher concentrations of L - arabinose ( Fig. 3 ) .
This observation was confirmed by Western blotting , which showed that serotype Typhimurium strain MA1 ( pCT6 ) expressed MisL only when grown in medium containing L - arabinose concentrations of 0.002 % or above ( Fig. 3 ) .
These data suggested that the misL : : lacZYA transcriptional - fusion reduced expression of the misL gene by an unknown mechanism .
Binding of MarT to the misL promoter region .
To determine whether MarT activates misL expression by binding to the misL promoter region , we constructed a plasmid ( pCT7 ) encoding a fusion protein between MarT and a C - terminal sixhistidine tag ( MarT - His ) whose expression was under the control of the arabinose promoter by using the primers 5 - GGA GCTCTCCTGCTACGCAGCCACAGCATC - 3 and 5 - GCT GCAGCCCATGTGTCACCCCGCGG - 3 and vector pBAD / gIIIA ( Invitrogen ) .
Growth of serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 ( pCT7 ) in the presence of L - arabinose resulted only in weak expression of MisL , as suggested by Western blot analysis ( data not shown ) .
These data suggested that the MarT - His fusion protein was not fully functional .
Attempts to purify MarT - His by affinity chromatography were not successful due to insolubility of the fusion protein .
To overcome this problem , the marT gene was amplified using the primers 5 GGGATC CATGTCCTGCTACGCAGCC 3 and 5 GGAATTCTTAC CCATGTGTCACCCCGCG 3 , and the resulting PCR product was cloned into vector pGEX4T - 2 to give rise to plasmid pCT17 .
Plasmid pCT17 encoded a fusion protein between glutathione - S-transferase ( GST ) and MarT ( GST - MarT ) , whose expression was under the control of the lac promoter .
Expression of MisL was detected by Western blotting after growth of serotype Typhimurium strain LT2 ( pCT17 ) in the presence of IPTG ( isopropyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ) ( Fig. 4A ) , suggesting that GST - MarT was functionally active .
( A ) EMSA for binding of GST or GST - MarT to the misL promoter region .
Purified GST ( Lane 1 ; 5 g/lane ) or purified GST - MarT fusion protein ( lane 2 ; 5 g/lane ) incubated with a biotin - labeled DNA fragment containing the misL promoter region .
( B ) EMSA for binding of GST - MarT to the misL promoter region in the absence of unlabeled DNA ( lane 1 ) or in competition with 10 - fold excess of the unlabeled DNA fragment containing the misL promoter region ( lane 2 ) or 10 - fold excess of an unrelated promoter region ( lane 3 ) .
GST - MarT protein ( 0 to 7.5 g ) affinity chromatography purified ( using glutathione - Sepharose [ Amersham Pharmacia ] ) from cell lysates ( French press at 12,000 lb/in 2 ) was tested for its ability to bind the misL promoter region using an electrophoretic mobility - shift assay ( EMSA ) ( Pierce LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit ; Pierce Biotechnology ) .
The reaction mixture was then analyzed by electrophoresis in a nondenaturing 5 % acrylamide gel with cold 0.5 Tris - borate - EDTA running buffer .
The DNA - protein complexes in the gel were electrophoretically transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane in 0.5 Tris - borate - EDTA at 380 mA for 30 to 60 min and detected using the EMSA kit .
Addition of increasing concentrations of GST - MarT to a biotin - labeled PCR product ( using the biotinylated primers 5 - AGTAAACG TGGACGAACGCTT - 3 and 5 - TACCGCTATGGCGATGA ATGA - 3 ) containing the misL promoter region resulted in the appearance of a band with higher molecular weight ( Fig. 4 ) .
Purified GST protein , used as a control , showed no binding activity for the misL promoter region ( Fig. 5 ) .
The specificity of the binding reaction was investigated by competition EMSA .
Addition of unlabeled PCR products containing the misL promoter to a mixture of GST - MarT and the biotin - labeled misL promoter fragment resulted in inhibition of the gel shift ( Fig. 5 ) .
In contrast , addition of unlabeled PCR products containing an unrelated promoter region ( the vjbR promoter from Brucella abortus ) did not inhibit the gel shift of the biotin - labeled misL promoter fragment by GST - MarT .
MisL and ShdA are two autotransporter proteins that mediate attachment to fibronectin and contribute to intestinal colonization of serotype Typhimurium in mice ( 5 , 14 , 16 -- 18 ) .
Expression of these autotransporter proteins is not detected by Western blotting after the growth of serotype Typhimurium under various in - vitro growth - conditions ( 5 , 17 ) .
However , expression of MisL and ShdA is induced in - vivo , as demonstrated by seroconversion to MisL during the infection of mice ( 5 ) and by a colocalizing immunofluorescence signal detected with anti - ShdA antiserum and anti - O4 antiserum in thin sections of the murine cecum after infection with serotype Typhimurium ( 17 ) .
Our data show that expression of misL is controlled by a transcriptional activator , MarT , which is encoded by SPI3 .
MarT and its close homologue CadC are members of the family of ToxR - like regulatory proteins .
CadC is a transcriptional activator of the cadBA operon encoding the lysine decarboxylase CadA and the lysine - cadaverine antiporter CadB of E. coli .
Under noninducing conditions , expression of cadBA is silenced by the histone - like nucleoid structuring ( H - NS ) protein , which binds the cadBA promoter region upstream of the CadC binding site .
Under inducing conditions ( i.e. , acidic external pH and exogenous lysine ) , CadC binds the cadBA promoter region , thereby dissolving the H - NS repressor complex and activating expression of the cadBA genes ( 20 ) .
In S. enterica , H - NS silences genes with GC contents lower than the genomic average ( i.e. , genes acquired by lateral gene transfer ) by restricting the access of RNA polymerase to DNA ( 22 , 26 ) .
SPI3 is a horizontally acquired DNA region with a GC content ( 47.5 % ) that is lower than the average GC content ( 52 % ) of the serotype Typhimurium genome ( 3 ) .
Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated the presence of an H - NS binding site in the promoter region of the serotype Typhimurium misL gene ( 22 , 26 ) .
It is thus possible that H - NS silences misL and that binding of MarT to the misL promoter region relieves this repression .
However , additional experiments are needed to test this prediction .
