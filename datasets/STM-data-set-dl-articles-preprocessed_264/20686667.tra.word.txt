* E - mail : chris@scs.uiuc.edu Introduction Salmonella enterica is a common food - borne pathogen that causes an array of diseases in humans , ranging from self - limiting gastroenteritis to life - threatening systemic infections [ 1,2 ] .
The bacterium initiates infection by invading intestinal epithelial cells using a type three secretion system ( T3SS ) encoded within a forty kilobase region of the chromosome called Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 ( SPI1 ) [ 3,4,5,6,7,8 ] .
The bacterium uses this T3SS to inject proteins into the cytoplasm of host cells [ 9,10,11 ] .
The injected proteins commandeer the host cell actin - cytoskeleton machinery and promote the uptake of the bacterium into these otherwise nonphagocytic cells [ 12,13,14,15 ] .
The genes encoding the SPI1 T3SS are tightly regulated by a network of interacting transcriptional regulators that are responsive to a combination of environmental and intracellular signals [ 16,17,18 ] .
These signals are presumably used by Salmonella as anatomical cues for initiating invasion and also for coordinating SPI1 gene expression with other cellular processes , most notably adhesion and motility [ 19,20,21,22,23,24 ] .
The master regulator for the SPI1 gene circuit is HilA , a transcription factor that contains a DNA - binding motif belonging to the OmpR/ToxR family [ 4 ] and a large C - terminal domain of unknown function [ 25 ] .
HilA activates the expression of the genes encoding the structural components of the SPI1 T3SS [ 4,26,27,28 ] .
HilA also activates the expression of an AraC - like transcription factor , InvF , involved in regulating the expression of the SPI1 secreted effector proteins and their cognate chaperones [ 29,30 ] .
HilA expression , in turn , is regulated by three AraC - like transcription factors - HilC , HilD , and RtsA -- with homologous DNA binding domains [ 22,31,32 ] .
Both hilC and hilD are encoded within SPI1 whereas rtsA is encoded elsewhere on the chromosome .
These three transcription factors can independently activate HilA expression .
They can also activate each others ' and their own expression [ 16 ] .
Specifically , HilC , HilD , and RtsA are all capable of individually activating the P hilA P hilC , P hilD , and P rtsA promoters .
These auto - regulatory interactions result in three coupled positive feedback loops comprising HilC , HilD , and RtsA , the output of each capable of activating HilA expression ( Figure 1A ) .
Of the three , HilD is dominant , as there is no HilA expression in its absence [ 33 ] .
This reflects the fact that many activating signals , both environmental and intracellular , affect SPI1 gene expression by modifying the activity of HilD protein [ 16,18,19,23,34,35 ] .
In addition to positive regulation , SPI1 gene expression is also subject to negative regulation .
HilE , a protein of unknown structure encoded outside SPI1 , binds HilD [ 34 ] and prevents it from activating its target promoters .
While the core architecture of the SPI1 gene circuit has been determined ( Figure 1A ) , the functions of these interacting PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 1 July 2010  Volume 6  Issue 7  e1001025 Regulation of the SPI1 Type Three Secretion System Author Summary Salmonella is a causative agent for a wide range of diseases in humans , including gastroenteritis and enteric fever .
A key step in the infection process occurs when Salmonella invades intestinal epithelial cells using a molecular hypodermic needle .
Salmonella uses these needles to inject proteins into host cells that enable the bacterium to enter and replicate within them .
The production of these needles , and the corollary decision to invade the host , is tightly controlled by a complex network of interacting regulatory proteins that , when studied individually , seemingly have either redundant or antagonizing effects .
To understand how this ensemble of regulators dynamically controls the expression of these invasion genes , we systematically deconstructed the network and then used this information to analyze their composite behavior by computer simulation .
Our analysis demonstrates that this regulatory network ensures that the invasion genes are expressed only when the invasion signals , a combination of environmental and cellular cues , exceed a defined threshold .
Once induced , this network further amplifies and accelerates the expression of the invasion genes .
These results further our understanding of this important pathogen by unraveling a key mechanism during infection , namely the decision to invade .
regulators and associated feedback loops are still unknown .
Therefore , to deconstruct this circuit , we measured gene expression dynamics at both population and single - cell resolution in a number of SPI1 regulatory mutants .
Based on these experimental results , we constructed a simple mathematical model of the SPI1 gene circuit .
Using the model , we demonstrate that the circuit serves two functions .
The first is to place a threshold on SPI1 activation , ensuring that the genes encoding the T3SS are expressed only in response to the appropriate combination of environmental and cellular cues .
The second is to amplify SPI1 gene expression .
To experimentally test these two predictions , we rewired the SPI1 network by changing its regulatory architecture .
The resulting experimental and computational analyses underpin an integrated model for the regulation of SPI1 gene expression .
Results Dynamics of SPI1 gene expression To investigate the dynamics of SPI1 gene expression , we grew cells statically in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium using 1 % NaCl as the inducing signal .
Growth in low - oxygen and high - salt conditions has previously been shown to induce SPI1 gene expression in - vitro [ 4,28 ] .
In these experiments , we grew the cells overnight in LB/no salt and then sub - cultured them into fresh LB/1 % NaCl medium , thus inducing a transition from SPI1 - repressing to SPI1 - inducing conditions .
We employed two different reporter systems to measure gene expression .
In our bulk , population - level experiments , we measured gene expression using plasmid - based promoter fusions to the luciferase operon , luxCDABE , from Photorhabdus luminescens [ 36,37 ] .
In our single - cell experiments , we employed promoter fusions to the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) using an otherwise identical plasmid - based system [ 38 ] .
The advantage of using the luciferase reporter system is that it is sensitive to dynamic changes in promoter activity , particularly at low levels of expression [ 39 ] .
However , bacterial luciferase produces insufficient light for single - cell studies , hence the need for fluorescent reporters .
We also note that the bacterial luciferase reporter system imposes a metabolic burden due to the production of the luciferase substrate , tetradecanal , by LuxC , LuxD , and LuxE [ 40 ] .
To account for any potential biases associated with bacterial luciferase , we repeated a number of population - level experiments using the GFP reporters with similar results ( results not shown ) .
We measured gene expression dynamics in wild - type cells using the luciferase reporter system .
After a brief lag following subculture , we found that the P hilD and P hilA promoters were activated in a sequential manner , consistent with HilD being necessary for HilA expression ( Figure 1B ) .
In the case of the P hilC and P rtsA promoters , we found that they were activated at roughly the same time as the P hilD promoter .
This hierarchy can also be seen when the expression values are normalized with respect to their maximal value ( Figure S1A ) .
These results indicate that there is a temporal hierarchy in SPI1 gene expression , with HilC , HilD , and RtsA at the top of the transcriptional cascade and HilA at the bottom .
A similar hierarchy has also been observed in the activation of the downstream promoters regulating the expression of the genes encoding the T3SS and secreted effector proteins [ 41 ] .
We also measured wild - type gene expression dynamics using flow cytometry in order to determine how individual cells within the population behave during SPI1 induction .
In the case of the P hilA promoter , the dynamics were not continuous ; rather , individual cells transitioned from an `` off '' to the `` on '' state in a switch - like manner ( Figure 1C ) .
By switch - like , we mean that the individual cells exist in one of two expression states .
At intermediate times , transient heterogeneity in the population is observed , with most cells existing in either the `` off '' or `` on '' state .
Similar switch - like dynamics were also observed for the P hilC , P hilD , and P rtsA promoters , with a comparable hierarchy in activation times as observed in the population data ( Figure S1B -- D ) .
We note that heterogeneity in SPI1 gene expression has been previously observed by others [ 42 ] .
As the SPI1 gene circuit involves multiple interacting positive feedback loops , these results are not surprising .
In particular , positive feedback is known to be an integral element in many cellular switches [ 43 ] .
To identify the genesis of this behavior , we further investigated the regulation of SPI1 gene expression .
Induction of the SPI1 gene circuit begins with a step increase in P hilD promoter activity HilD is necessary for HilA expression .
Even though HilC and RtsA can independently activate HilA expression when constitutively expressed from ectopic promoters , these two regulators are incapable of doing so in the absence of HilD when expressed from their native promoters [ 16 ] .
Therefore , to understand the role of HilD , we measured gene expression dynamics in a DhilD mutant using the luciferase reporters .
In the case of the P hilA promoter , we observed no activity in the absence of HilD ( data not shown ) , consistent with previous reports [ 16,33 ] .
In the case of the P hilD promoter , we observed a weak , step - like increase in activity in the absence of HilD ( Figure 2A ) .
When we performed identical experiments using flow cytometry , we found that the P hilD promoter again transitions from an `` off '' to the `` on '' state in a switch - like manner ( Figure 2B ) .
These results are identical to what is observed in wild - type cells , the only difference being that the magnitude of expression is significantly reduced when HilD is not present .
We also performed identical experiments in a DSPI1 DrtsA mutant and observed the same response ( Figure S2A ) , indicating that the transient switch in P hilD promoter activity is not due to any SPI1 regulator but rather factors external to SPI1 .
These results demonstrate that the SPI1 gene circuit is activated by a step increase in P hilD promoter activity .

HilA is the master SPI1 regulator as it activates the expression of the genes encoding the T3SS .
HilA , in turn , is regulated by HilC , HilD , and RtsA .
These three regulators can independently activate HilA expression .
They can also activate their own expression and that of each other 's .
HilE represses the activity of HilD by binding to it and preventing it from activating its target promoters .

To induce SPI1 gene expression , cells were first grown overnight in LB/no salt and then sub - cultured into fresh LB/1 % NaCl conditions to an OD of 0.05 and grown statically .

g001 amplified by a positive feedback loop involving HilD .
As discussed below , HilC and RtsA serve to further amplify this signal .
Interestingly , the heterogeneity in SPI1 activation is not due to the interacting positive feedback loops within the circuit but rather is intrinsic to the activating signal .
The signals activating the P hilD promoter , however , are unknown .
While multiple global regulators are known to affect SPI1 gene expression [ 44 ] , these regulators appear to affect the activity of the HilD protein and not its promoter [ 16,18,19,23,35 ] .
With regards to HilC and RtsA , we found that the P hilC promoter was active in absence of HilD , though at a reduced level , whereas the P rtsA promoter was effectively off ( Figure S2B ) .
However , even though the P hilC promoter is active in the absence of HilD , HilA is not expressed .
These results suggest that activation of the P hilD promoter is the trigger mechanism for induction of SPI1 gene expression .
Interestingly , when we assayed P hilC promoter activity in a DhilD mutant using flow cytometry , we found that the dynamics were not switch - like but rather continuous and rheostatic ( Figure S2C ) .
This homogeneity within the population indicates that the signal activating the P hilC promoter is fundamentally different than the one activating the P hilD promoter .
HilC and RtsA function as transcriptional amplifiers and accelerators Unlike HilD , the HilC and RtsA proteins are not absolutely required for HilA expression .
Yet , these two proteins can independently induce transcription from the P hilA promoter when constitutively expressed from an ectopic promoter [ 16 ] .
To understand the role of these two proteins in regulating SPI1 , we PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 3 July 2010  Volume 6  Issue 7  e1001025 Regulation of the SPI1 Type Three Secretion System Figure 2 .

( B ) Comparison of P hilD ( pSS072 ) promoter activity in wild type ( black ) and a DhilD mutant ( JS253 , grey ) as determined using GFP transcriptional reporters and flow cytometry .
Note that the activation of the P hilD promoter is switch - like both in wild type and the DhilD mutant .
Experiments were performed as described in Figure 1 .
g002 compared gene expression in wild type and a DhilC DrtsA mutant using the luciferase reporters ( Figure 3A ) .
Deleting these two regulators decreases the activity of the P hilD and P hilA promoters .
Moreover , in the DhilC DrtsA mutant , there is also a delay in the induction of the P hilA promoter .
This delay becomes more apparent when we normalize the luminescence measurements with respect to their maximal values ( Figure S3A ) .
When we measured gene expression at single - cell resolution using flow cytometry , we again observed a switch - like response in the DhilC DrtsA mutant ( Figure 3B ) .
The main difference relative to wild type was that the transition from the `` off '' to `` on '' state occurred more slowly in the absence of HilC and RtsA .
Also , the activity of the P hilA promoter in the `` on '' state was lower in the DhilC DrtsA mutant than in wild type .
With the P hilD promoter , we did not observe any change in the timing of promoter activation in the DhilC DrtsA mutant relative to wild type ( Figure 3C and S3A ) .
Rather , we observed only a decrease in the level of P hilD promoter activity associated with the `` on '' state .
Similar results for both promoters are observed in the single deletion mutants , though the overall effect is small , indicating that HilC and RtsA additively contribute to SPI1 gene expression ( Figure S3B -- E ) .
Based on these results , we conclude that HilC and RtsA serve two functions in the SPI1 circuit .
First , HilC and RtsA amplify HilA and HilD expression , in the sense that HilA and HilD expression is reduced the absence of HilC and RtsA .
Second , HilC and RtsA accelerate the transition of HilA expression from the `` off '' to the `` on '' state .
HilE dampens SPI1 gene expression We next investigated the role of HilE in the SPI1 gene circuit .
HilE binds to HilD and prevents it from activating the P hilD , P hilC , P rtsA , and P hilA promoters [ 34 ] .
As HilD is at the top of the SPI1 transcriptional cascade , HilE is able to repress the expression of all SPI1 genes .
However , unlike the other regulators , HilE does not participate in a feedback loop , as its expression is not regulated by any SPI1 gene ( data not shown ) .
Rather , its expression is regulated by exogenous factors .
For example , the type I fimbrial regulator , FimZ , increases HilE expression whereas the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system ( PTS ) regulator , Mlc , represses it [ 23,24,35 ] .
We compared gene expression using the luciferase assay in wild type and a DhilE mutant ( Figure 4A ) .
In the case of both the P hilD and P hilA promoters , we observed a roughly two - fold increase in promoter activity in the absence of HilE .
However , we found that HilE did not affect the timing of activation for these two promoters ( Figure S4A ) .
Similar results were observed in the flow cytometry experiments for the P hilD and P hilA promoters ( Figure 4B and S4B ) and the P hilC and P rtsA promoters ( data not shown ) .
These data suggest that HilE serves to dampen SPI1 gene expression by reducing the maximal level of promoter activity .
Computational analysis of SPI1 gene circuit The defining feature of the SPI1 gene circuit is the presence of three coupled positive feedback loops .
An immediate question then is why are multiple loops present when most bacterial circuits employing feedback have just one .
To explore this question in more detail , we constructed a simple mathematical model of the SPI1 gene circuit based on our understanding of how it functions ( details provided in the Materials and Methods section ) .
The model is qualitatively consistent with our experimental results , both with respect to the dynamics of HilD , HilC , RtsA , and HilA expression ( Figure 5A -- C ) as well as the effects of mutations on HilD and HilA expression ( Figure 5D -- E ) at both population and single - cell resolution .
In constructing this model , we assumed that asynchronous activation of the P hilD promoter in individual cells causes the transient heterogeneity observed in SPI1 gene expression .
We specifically assumed that the P hilD promoter is activated at random times in individual cells , where the times are exponentially distributed .
Otherwise , the model is entirely deterministic .
To capture the heterogeneous response , we also needed to assume that the switch from the `` off '' to `` on '' state occurs rapidly in individual cells , more rapidly than what is observed in the population ( Figure 1B ) .
Otherwise , the cells will respond homogenously as differences in the timing of the activating signal in individual cells would be smoothed out due to the slow kinetics of the circuit .
As our results demonstrate , this mechanism is sufficient for generating transient heterogeneity .
In fact , if the P hilD promoter is activated in all cells at the same time or the kinetics of the switch are too slow , then the population behaves homo - PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 4 July 2010  Volume 6  Issue 7  e1001025 Regulation of the SPI1 Type Three Secretion System Figure 3 .

In the case of the P hilC promoter , we assumed that it was activated at the same time in all cells .
While transient heterogeneity is observed in wild type cells ( Figure S1C ) , the P hilC promoter behaves homogenously in a DhilD mutant ( Figure S2C ) .
Our model is also able to capture this behavior ( Figure S5C -- D ) .
Our goal in constructing this model was not simply to recapitulate our experimental results but rather to explore the behavior of the circuit by simulating it over a range of different parameter values .
In particular , we employed the model to explore the roles of coupled positive feedback and HilE in regulating SPI1 gene expression .
When performing this parametric analysis , we found it most informative to focus on the steady - state behavior of the SPI1 gene circuit .
This enabled us to explore the effect of a limited number of model parameters two at a time and also bypass the issue of stochasticity .
As a consequence , our analysis is confined to the parameters characterizing the regulatory topology of the circuit and not those defining the dynamics ( e.g. degradation and protein - protein association/disassociation rates ) .
We first considered the role of positive feedback on HilD expression , given the central role of this SPI1 regulator .
To perform this analysis , we varied the degree by which the SPI1 regulators - HilC , HilD , and RtsA - could activate HilD expression by simulating the model at different values for the parameter k D .
When interpreting these results , we found it informative to also vary the strength of the activating signal in our simulations , given by the parameter a D in the model .
As shown in Figure 6A , HilD expression increases as the value of the parameter k D increases , equivalent to increasing the strength of the feedback on HilD expression .
When this feedback is sufficiently strong , the response to the activating signal becomes discontinuous and switch - like .
These results suggest that , in addition to amplifying the response , Figure 6 .
Parametric analysis of model predicts that SPI1 gene circuit functions as an amplifier and encodes an activation threshold .
( A ) Effect of positive feedback on HilD expression .
Plot shows steady - state concentration of HilD as a function of the parameters k D and a D .
The parameter k D specifies the degree by which the SPI1 regulators - HilC , HilD , and RtsA - can activate HilD expression , effectively the strength of positive feedback on HilD expression .
The parameter a D specifies the strength of the signal activating HilD expression .
( B ) Effect of HilC and RtsA on HilD expression .
Plot shows the steady - state concentration of HilD as a function of the parameters k C , k R , and a D .
The parameters k C and k R specify the degree by which the SPI1 regulators - HilC , HilD , and RtsA - can activate HilC and RtsA expression , respectively .
In other words , these parameters set the strength of feedback on HilC and RtsA expression .
In these simulations , the parameters k C and k R were both varied in tandem : the numerical values for the two are the same .
( C ) Effect of HilE on HilD expression .
Plot shows the steady - state concentration of HilD as a function of the parameters a E and a D .
The parameter k E specifies the rate of HilE expression .
Results for HilA are shown in Figures S6A -- C .
The black lines in the plots are used to denote the results obtained using the nominal parameters ( aside from a E ) .
A detailed description of the model is provided in the Materials and Methods .
g006 PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 7 July 2010  Volume 6  Issue 7  e1001025 Regulation of the SPI1 Type Three Secretion System positive feedback may serve , along with HilE as described below , to endow the SPI1 circuit with an activation threshold .
This threshold would ensure that SPI1 gene expression occurs only when a sufficiently strong activating signal is present .
Moreover , the threshold decreases as the strength of the feedback increases , indicating that there is a tradeoff between the degree of amplification and the size of the threshold .
Next , we explored the effect of HilC and RtsA on SPI1 gene expression by varying the strength of their connectivity within the circuit .
Specifically , we varied the degree by which the SPI1 regulators -- HilD , HilC and RtsA - could enhance both HilC and RtsA gene expression , given respectively by the parameters k C and k R in the model .
As HilC and RtsA both have a weaker effect on SPI1 gene expression than HilD , the degree of amplification is also less strong though the overall trend is the same ( Figure 6B ) .
Similar results are also obtained when the expression of only one protein is varied , though the effect then is even weaker ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that HilC and RtsA serve to fine tune SPI1 gene expression .
A useful analogy here is to consider the fine and coarse focusing knobs on a microscope , where HilC and RtsA provide the fine - tune control and HilD the coarse control .
This may explain why HilC and RtsA have a significantly weaker effect on SPI1 gene expression than HilD as the circuit is more robust than one with three strong regulators in the sense that only a single regulator defines the behavior of the circuit whereas the others simply tune the output .
Last , we explored the effect of HilE on SPI1 gene expression .
Unlike the other SPI1 regulators , HilE is not known to be involved in any feedback loops with the other SPI1 regulators .
Rather , its expression is controlled by exogenous factors .
In our simulations , we varied the rate of HilE expression , given by the parameter a E in the model .
Consistent with its role as a negative regulator , HilE decreased both HilD and HilA expression in a dose - dependent manner ( Figures 6C and S6C ) .
In addition , when expressed at a sufficiently high rate , HilE effectively shuts off the expression of HilD and HilA , a result that we also observe experimentally ( data not shown ) .
Most notably , our model predicts that HilE sets the threshold for SPI1 activation - as the rate of HilE expression increases so does the threshold for activation and vice versa .
The exogenous factors regulating HilE expression , therefore , may serve to tune this activation threshold .
However , we note that HilE alone does not endow the SPI1 circuit with a threshold .
Rather , the threshold results from the complex interplay between HilE and the HilD positive feedback loop ( Figure S6D ) .
Taken together , these results allow us to assign putative function to the interacting regulators and associated feedback loops comprising the SPI1 gene circuit .
When viewed as a whole , the circuit appears to serve two functions .
The first is to place a threshold on SPI1 activation , ensuring that the assembly of the needle complex is initiated only in response to the appropriate combination of environmental and cellular cues .
The second is to amplify SPI1 gene expression .
Rewiring the SPI1 gene circuit Our computational analysis predicts that the SPI1 gene circuit functions as a gene expression amplifier with a variable activation threshold .
While our experimental results directly support the conclusion regarding gene amplification ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , the one concerning the activation threshold is not evident from our experimental results , and thus derives solely from analysis of the model .
Therefore , to test this prediction regarding the threshold experimentally , we rewired the SPI1 gene circuit by replacing the P hilD promoter with the weaker P hilC promoter at its native chromosomal locus in an otherwise DhilC background .
In this mutant , ( DP hilD : :P hilC DhilC ) , hilD is transcriptionally regulated in a manner similar to hilC .
If the circuit does indeed function to place a threshold on activation , then we expect that this mutant will be unable to induce HilA expression if the activating signal for the P hilC promoter is too weak to overcome the threshold .
We found the P hilA promoter is not active in this strain ( Figure 7A ) , suggesting that the P hilC activating signal is too weak to overcome the threshold as hypothesized .
If true , then according to our model , removing HilE should enable HilA expression as it sets the activation threshold .
In agreement with our model predictions , we found that if the hilE gene is removed , then the P hilA promoter is active in a related strain ( DP hilD : :P hilC DhilC DhilE ) ( Figure 7A ) .
In other words , by removing the threshold set by HilE , HilD is capable of inducing HilA expression when expressed Figure 7 .
Rewiring SPI1 gene circuits demonstrates that HilE imposes threshold on activation .
( A ) Comparison of time - course dynamics for P hilA ( pSS077 ) promoter activities in wild type ( black ) , CR355 ( DP hilD : :P hilC DhilC , red ) and CR356 ( DP hilD : :P hilC DhilC DhilE , blue ) as determined using luciferase transcriptional reporters .
In strain CR355 , the P hilD promoter was replaced with the P hilC promoter in an otherwise DhilC background .
In this strain , hilD is transcriptionally regulated in a manner identical to hilC .
Strain CR356 is the same as CR355 except that it lacks HilE .
( B ) Dynamics of P hilA promoter activity in CR356 as determined using green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) transcriptional - fusions and flow cytometry .
Note that the activation of the P hilA promoter in CR356 is no longer switch - like but rather rheostatic in nature .
Similar dynamics are seen with the P hilC promoter ( Figure S2C ) .
Experiments were performed as described in Figure 1 .
g007 PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 8 July 2010  Volume 6  Issue 7  e1001025 Regulation of the SPI1 Type Three Secretion System from the weaker P hilC promoter .
However , when the threshold is present , HilD is not expressed at sufficiently high levels to overcome this threshold .
When we measured gene expression in this strain ( DP hilD : :P hilC DhilC DhilE ) using flow cytometry , we no longer observed the transient heterogeneity found in wild type .
Rather , we found that the population responded homogeneously ( Figure 7B ) .
As we have previously noted , the input signal to the P hilC promoter is not switch - like but instead is homogenous and rheostatic in nature ( Figure S2C ) .
These results further support our hypothesis that the switch - like dynamics observed in wild type is due to asynchronous activation of the P hilD promoter ( Figure 2B ) and not intrinsic to the circuit .
In particular , when hilD is expressed from the P hilC promoter then hilA expression is also not switch - like but instead homogenous and rheostatic .
Thus , the characteristics of the output of the circuit match the input .
In other words , the qualitative dynamics of the input driving hilD expression are also observed in the network output , namely hilA expression .
Collectively , these results support our conclusion that the SPI1 gene circuit functions as a genetic amplifier with an activation threshold , where the circuit magnifies the activating signal only if this signal exceeds a defined threshold .
A remaining question concerns the uniqueness of the SPI1 regulators given their similarity to one another .
Namely , to what degree are HilC , RtsA , and HilD interchangeable ?
Of the three , HilD is the most important as HilA is not expressed in its absence .
In formulating the model , we needed to assume that HilD was dominant in the sense that it was required for activating HilA expression .
We also needed to assume that HilD was necessary for establishing connectivity within the network , where it was again required for HilC - and RtsA - dependent activation of the P hilC , P hilD , and P rtsA promoters ( see Materials and Methods for further details ) .
HilC and RtsA , on the other hand , appear to play an ancillary role in regulating SPI1 gene expression .
These two proteins simply tune gene expression in a HilD - dependent manner .
One specific question then is whether this behavior is intrinsic to these proteins , as assumed in the model , or simply due to these proteins not being expressed at sufficiently high levels ( as HilC and RtsA can independently activate SPI1 gene expression when over expressed ) .
To explore this issue in more detail , we rewired the SPI1 gene circuit by placing hilC under the control of the P hilD promoter .
In this reciprocal design , we replaced the P hilC promoter with the P hilD promoter at its native chromosomal locus in an otherwise DhilD background ( DP hilC : :P hilD DhilD ) .
The rationale behind this promoter replacement experiment was to see whether HilC alone could induce HilA expression if expressed from the P hilD promoter .
As HilD is capable of inducing HilA expression in absence of HilC or RtsA , we reasoned that HilC may be able to do the same in the absence of HilD if it is transcribed in a manner similar to hilD .
However , despite trying designs where different sections of the promoter region were replaced , we were unable to engineer a strain where the P hilA promoter was active in the absence of HilD ( data not shown ) .
These results lend credence to our hypothesis regarding HilD dominance used in formulating the model , namely that HilD is necessary for activating the SPI1 promoter under physiological conditions .
Discussion Using a combination of experimental and computational approaches , we found that the SPI1 gene circuit functions as a signal amplifier with an activation threshold .
This virulence switch likely ensures that the SPI1 T3SS is assembled only when the bacterium has reached its target site for invasion , the distal small intestine [ 45 ] .
Salmonella is thought to be able to determine its location within the host by sensing a number of environmental factors , key among them oxygen and osmolarity [ 28 ] .
In addition to these environmental signals , SPI1 gene expression is also coordinated with other cellular processes such as motility and adhesion [ 19,20,21,22,23,24 ] .
The accumulated evidence to date , including the results from this study , indicates that HilD is the primary site for signal integration .
According to our model , these activating signals , both intracellular cellular and environmental , initiate SPI1 gene expression by inducing the expression and activation of HilD through still unknown mechanisms .
HilE , however , binds to HilD and inhibits its activity .
Only when the activating signals are sufficiently strong is HilD expressed at a high enough level to overcome sequestration by HilE and activate the expression of the other SPI1 regulators -- HilC , RtsA , and HilA - and also further induce its own expression .
Once induced , HilC and RtsA serve to further amplify and also accelerate SPI1 gene expression .
The result is a two - state switch with a defined activation threshold , defined in the sense that the threshold is set by the level of HilE expression and possibly other systems that function through HilD protein [ 44 ] .
A notable feature of the SPI1 gene circuit is the presence of three , coupled positive feedback loops .
At the most fundamental level , positive feedback amplifies the response to an external signal [ 46,47 ] .
It is also capable of effectively transforming a continuous input into a digital output when the feedback is sufficiently strong .
In the context of bacterial gene circuits , positive feedback has most often been associated with multi - stable switches and cell population heterogeneity [ 43,48 ] .
What makes the SPI1 gene circuit particularly intriguing is that most bacterial systems utilizing positive feedback , at least those documented so far in the literature , possess only a single loop .
We first note that these additional feedback loops , namely the ones regulating the expression of HilC and RtsA , do not add redundancy to the circuit , as the loss of HilD effectively shuts off SPI1 gene expression .
Rather , they serve to further amplify and accelerate SPI1 gene expression .
In vivo , loss of either HilC or RtsA does not significantly attenuate intestinal invasion .
Yet , loss of both does [ 16 ] , indicating that the amplification or acceleration provided by these loops plays an important physiological role .
Whether this role is simply to ensure that the SPI1 structural genes are expressed at sufficiently high levels or to provide a sharp activation threshold is still unknown .
Only a few studies to date , mostly focused on eukaryotic systems where this regulation is more common , have explored systems employing coupled positive feedback [ 49,50,51,52 ] .
In one notable theoretical study , the coupling of a slow and fast positive feedback loop was shown to yield a `` dual - time '' switch that is capable of being rapidly induced yet still is robust to fluctuations in the activating signal [ 49 ] .
However , these properties are not obtained when two loops of the same type are coupled .
While rapid induction is observed in SPI1 gene expression , there is no evidence to suggest that some loops are fast whereas others are slow .
Furthermore , these loops do not operate synergistically in the sense that coupling in the SPI1 gene circuit does not engender new functions unattainable with just a single loop .
As the loops involving HilC and RtsA only additively contribute to the response , we imagine that the coupling in SPI1 may result instead from the piecewise evolution of the circuit .
According to this model , HilC and RtsA were acquired to compensate for the inability of HilD alone to mediate a robust response .
The motivation for this model comes from a recent study where a synthetic gene circuit coupling two weak positive feedback loops PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 9 July 2010  Volume 6  Issue 7  e1001025 Regulation of the SPI1 Type Three Secretion System was engineered [ 53 ] .
The authors found that their coupled circuit yielded a bistable response that , in the case of a single loop circuit , could be obtained only with an ultrasensitive activator even though the individual regulators in the coupled circuit lacked this behavior .
Based on these results , the authors speculated that natural circuits could evolve using a similar approach - rather than evolve a circuit with a single regulator requiring precise biochemical properties , a more robust and facile solution may be obtained by simply linking together multiple regulators that alone lack the requisite properties .
Similarly , others have shown that by changing the regulatory architecture of a circuit one can affect is behavior without commensurate changes in the underlying proteins [ 54,55,56 ] .
We hypothesize that a similar process may have occurred with the SPI1 gene circuit .
As such , this model provides one possible explanation as to why the circuit involves multiple feedback loops when one alone would suffice .
In a related study , we found that the gene circuit controlling the expression of type I fimbriae in Salmonella utilizes two coupled positive feedback loops [ 24 ] .
In this system , the expression of the genes encoding the type I fimbriae is controlled by two regulators , FimY and FimZ .
These two proteins form two coupled positive feedback loops and encode a logical AND gate or , alternatively , a coincidence circuit .
A similar logic may also be also encoded within the SPI1 gene circuit .
In particular , HilC is expressed in the absence of HilD .
Moreover , the signals activating the P hilC promoter appear to be different than the ones activating the P hilD promoter , given their dissimilar dynamics .
We are tempted therefore to speculate that , in addition to being an amplifier , the SPI1 gene circuit may also function as some sort of coincidence circuit , optimally expressing SPI1 genes only when the activating signals for both the P hilC and P hilD promoter are present .
Coupled feedback in this case would reinforce the effect of these signals and further link the two .
While such a model alone would not explain why multiple feedbacks loops are present in the SPI1 gene circuit , it may nonetheless provide one possible advantage for such a design .
In conclusion , we have been able to propose an integrated model for the regulation of SPI1 gene expression .
While this system has been studied extensively , an integrated model of its regulation was previously lacking .
Using a combination of experimental and computational analyses , we have been able to deconstruct this complex circuit and determine how the individual components contribute towards its integrated function .
A key element in our analysis involved rewiring the SPI1 genetic circuit .
As the kinetic parameters are unavailable and difficult to perturb , direct validation of our model remains an elusive challenge .
However , by rewiring the circuit , we were nonetheless able to test a number of predictions from our mathematical model .
Such an approach provides a powerful framework for integrating models with experimental data , particularly when parameters values are lacking or difficult to perturb .
Finally , our results provide a detailed examination of a natural system employing coupled positive feedback , a mechanism of control that to date has primarily been investigated in eukaryotes .
Materials and Methods Growth conditions All experiments were performed in Luria - Bertani broth ( LB ) ( 10 g/L tryptone , 5 g/L yeast extract , and 10 g/L NaCl ) unless otherwise specified .
Bacterial strains were grown at 37uC except for strains carrying the temperature sensitive plasmids , pKD46 or pCP20 , which were grown at 30uC as described previously [ 57 ] .
Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations : ampicillin at 100 mg/mL ; chloramphenicol at 34 mg/mL ; kanamycin at 40 mg/mL , and tetracycline at 25 mg/mL .
Bacterial strains and plasmids All Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains used in this study are isogenic derivatives of strain ATCC 14028 ( American Type Culture Collection ) and are listed in Table 1 .
The strain CR349 ( DSPI1 : : FRT DrtsA5 ) was made by first transducing the D ( invH - avrA ) 2916 : : cm ( called DSPI1 : : cm ) allele from JS481 into the strain JS248 ( DrtsA5 ) using P22HTint [ 58 ] .
The chloramphenicol antibiotic resistance gene was then removed by introducing pCP20 .
To make the strain CR350 ( DhilC : : FRT DrtsA5 ) , we first transduced the DhilC : : cm allele from JS252 ( DhilC : : cm ) into the strain JS248 ( DrtsA5 ) .
The antibiotic resistance marker was then removed using pCR20 .
The strain CR351 ( DhilE : : kan ) was made by replacing the hilE gene ( genomic region 4763554 -- 4764087 ) with the kanamycin resistance gene from pKD4 using l - Red mediated homologous recombination [ 57 ] .
The strain CR352 ( DP hilD : :P hilC ) was made using a two - step counter selection procedure involving the tetRA element from transposon Tn10 [ 59 ] .
In the first step , the P hilD promoter ( genomic region 3017694 -- 3017820 ) was replaced with the tetRA element using l - Red mediated homologous recombination .
The tetRA marker was then moved into a clean wild - type background ( 14028 ) by P22 transduction .
Next , the tetRA element was replaced by the P hilC promoter ( genomic region 3013780 -- 3013010 ) using l - Red mediated homologous recombination and a fusaric acid counter selection , as described previously [ 59 ] .
The resulting strain , CR352 ( DP hilD : :P hilC ) , has the hilD gene with its native ribosome binding site under the control of P hilC promoter .

The antibiotic resistance markers were removed by introducing pCP20 .
Similarly , we also constructed two strains , CR357 and CR358 , where the P hilC promoter was replaced by the P hilD promoter .
In the first design , CR357 ( DP hilC : :P hilD ) , the P hilC promoter ( genomic region 3013780 -- 3013010 ) was replaced with the P hilD promoter ( genomic region 3017694 -- 3017820 ) leaving the hilC ribosome binding site intact .
In second design , CR358 ( DP hilC : :P hilD hilD RBS ) , the upstream region of the hilC gene ( genomic region 3013780 -- 3013000 ) was replaced by the upstream region of the hilD gene ( genomic region 3017694 -- 3017830 ) .
All mutants were subsequently checked using primers that bound outside the region deleted .
All chromosomal promoter replacements were verified by amplifying and sequencing the mutated regions .
All plasmids used in the study are listed in Table 2 .
Transcriptional fusions to the SPI1 promoters were made by cloning the promoter of interest upstream of either the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) or the luxCDABE operon from Photorhabdus luminescens on a medium - copy plasmid [ 36,37 ] .
To construct the plasmid pSS098 , pPROBE - gfp was digested with EcoRI and NheI and pPROTet.E was digested with EcoRI and AvrII .
The gfp gene fragment from the digested pPROBE - gfp was then cloned into the digested pPROTet.E resulting in the plasmid pSS098 .
All constructs were sequenced prior to transformation in the wild - type and mutant strains .
Fluorescence measurements Cultures were first grown overnight in LB - medium lacking salt under vigorous shaking at 37uC ( SPI1 repressing conditions ) and then sub - cultured 1:1000 into fresh LB - medium ( with salt ) and grown statically in test tubes at 37uC for 12 hours [ 34,60 ] .
A 100 mL aliquot of each culture was then transferred to a 96 - well microplate , and fluorescence and absorbance ( OD600 ) were measured using a Tecan Safire2 microplate reader .
The fluorescence readings , given in terms of relative fluorescence units ( RFU ) , were normalized to the OD600 absorbance to account for cell density .
For single - cell fluorescence measurements , overnight cultures were first grown under SPI1 - repressing conditions at 37uC .
The cells were then sub - cultured to an OD of 0.05 into fresh LB medium ( with salt ) and grown statically at 37uC .
Samples were collected at different time points by resuspending them in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) with 34 mg/mL chloramphenicol in order to arrest translation and then storing on ice .
All fluorescent - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) experiments were performed on a BD LRS II system from BD Biosciences .
Data extraction and analysis for the FACS experiments was done using FCS Express Version 3 ( De Novo Software ) .
For all FACS experiments , fluorescence values of 30,000 events were recorded and reported as a histogram .
In the flow cytometry experiments involving the P hilC and P hilD promoters , we used destabilized GFP transcriptional - fusions where the sequence AANDENYAASV was appended to the C - terminus of the protein .
This tag reduces the half life of GFP from approximately 24 hours to 110 minutes [ 38,61 ] .
The reason that we needed to employ destabilized GFP is that P hilC and P hilD promoters are partially active even when the cells are grown in SPI1 - repressing conditions .
As a consequence , we were unable to observe the `` off '' to the `` on '' transition using `` tagless '' GFP .
We did not run into similar problems with the P hilA and P rtsA promoters and consequently used transcriptional - fusions to `` tagless '' GFP .
Qualitatively similar results are obtained when using destabilized GFP transcriptional - fusions to these promoters ( data not shown ) .
Luminescence measurements For time - course luminescence experiments , cultures were grown overnight at 37uC in SPI1 - repressing conditions .

In addition , 20 mL of mineral oil was also added to the well to prevent evaporation [ 62 ] .

Three independent experiments were performed on separate days .
For each experiment , six samples were tested .
The average values and standard deviations are reported .
Model description The major assumptions used in formulating the model are enumerated below .
In formulating the model , we focused solely on the interacting SPI1 regulators - HilC , HilD , HilE , and RtsA - and their role in regulating hilA expression .
In particular , we ignored the effects of additional external regulators [ 17,44 ] .
These external factors were accounted for implicitly in the model through our choice of the kinetic parameters .
In other words , we assumed that there are no additional feedback loops beyond those detailed in Figure 1A .
As a consequence , we treated these external regulators as constant inputs into the model .
The validity of this hypothesis is debatable , though there is insufficient evidence at this time to consider any reasonable alternatives .
We also did not include the downstream SPI1 regulators -- InvF and SicA -- in the model .
These downstream regulators do not appear to affect HilA expression .
Rather , they are thought to regulate the timing of expression of the proteins comprising the SPI1 needle complex and the secreted effectors [ 29,41,63 ] .
In these regards , the model focuses only on initiation and ignores assembly and secretion .
It also does not account for the decrease in SPI1 gene expression when cells enter stationary - phase ( Figure 1B ) .
The model does not account for negative regulation by HilA and SprB .
HilA , in particular , negatively regulates its own expression by apparently binding to the P hilA promoter and repressing transcription [ 64 ] .
Likewise , SprB , a transcription factor from the LuxR/UhaP family that is positively regulated by HilA , appears to bind to the HilD promoter and weakly repress its activity [ 65 ] .
Inclusion of these negative feedback loops does not substantively affect the results from our model and , for simplicity , we chose to ignore them in the model .
The model does not distinguish between transcription and translation .
Both are lumped together in a single step .
As a consequence , the rate of protein synthesis is assumed to be linearly proportional to the concentration of mRNA within the cell .
Our justification for this assumption is that , based on a number of unpublished observations , we believe that the regulation of HilD occurs primarily either at the transcriptional or the post - translational level ( i.e. the level of HilD protein ) .
HilC , HilD , and RtsA are all AraC - like transcription factors and likely function only in the dimeric form .
In the model , we assume for simplicity that the dimers form spontaneously and are stable ( i.e. the dimerization reaction is irreversible ) .
As a consequence , the model does not distinguish between the monomeric and dimeric forms ; all protein is assumed to be in the dimeric form .
We also do not account for the possible formation of heterodimers .
HilC and RtsA can independently induce HilA expression [ 16 ] .
Yet , in the absence of HilD , HilA is not expressed even though hilC is transcribed ( albeit at reduced levels ) .
To account for HilD dominance ( or rather dominant epistasis ) in the model , we needed to assume that the SPI1 promoters have two binding sites with occupancy of both required for transcription .
We specifically assumed that one site is highly specific for HilD with only weak affinity for HilC and RtsA .
This first binding site establishes dominance as it effectively probes for whether HilD is present in the cell .
Moreover , because of its high affinity , HilD will occupy this site even when expressed at low levels .
Due to their weak affinity , neither HilC nor RtsA will occupy this site under physiological conditions .
However , when over expressed , the elevated concentrations of these proteins will compensate for their weak affinity for this site , allowing them to bind .
The second site , on the other hand , has moderate affinity for all three regulators ( with the affinity for HilD still the highest ) and serves to tune expression in proportion to their aggregate concentration .
Other alternatives are possible , though this model for promoter regulation offers perhaps the simplest mechanism to explain HilD dominance consistent with what we already know about SPI1 gene expression .
Moreover , others have found that the SPI1 promoters contain multiple binding sites for the HilC , HilD , and RtsA [ 31,32 ] , so this assumption is not entirely implausible .
Lastly , we note that while HilD dominance has been documented previously only in the case of the P hilA promoter , our data suggests that it also extends to the P hilC , P hilD , and P rtsA promoters as detailed below .
The most speculative aspect of the model concerns the mechanism for activation of the SPI1 promoters -- P hilA , P hilC , P hilD , and P rtsA - by HilC , HilD , and RtsA .
In the model , we assume that all four promoters have the same two binding sites , one highly specific for HilD and the other much less so ( see Assumption 5 ) .
While there is no mechanistic data to support this hypothesis , we have found that the promoter activities are linearly proportional to one another when we compared them at varying levels of NaCl induction and in different genetic backgrounds ( Figure S7 ) .
The simplest explanation for this linear correlation is that all four promoters have the same two binding sites .
As a consequence , we used the same mathematical expressions and parameters to model occupancy of the P hilA , P hilC , P hilD , and P rtsA promoters by the SPI1 regulators .
Aside from our supporting data , we significantly reduce the number of free parameters in the model by invoking this assumption .
The model assumes that HilE not only binds and inhibits HilD but also promotes its degradation .
While there is no experimental data to support such a mechanism , we found it necessary to match our experimental results for the DhilE mutant .
In the absence of such a mechanism , we found that the steady - state concentrations of HilD and HilA were not affected by HilE , a result contrary to experimental observations .
The model assumes that the transient heterogeneity observed in the gene expression data is due solely to asynchrony in the timing of the activation signal .
To model this behavior , we assumed that the P hilD promoter is activated at random times in individual cells , where the activation times are exponentially distributed .
In the case of the P hilC promoter , we assumed that it is activated in a deterministic manner .
For simplicity , we assumed that both promoters have , on average , the same activation kinetics .
Beyond asynchrony in the timing of activation , we do not believe that noise arising from any PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 12 July 2010  Volume 6  Issue 7  e1001025 Regulation of the SPI1 Type Three Secretion System number of possible sources plays a critical role in SPI1 gene expression beyond introducing variability in the gene expression measurements ( see below ) .
To qualitatively compare the simulation results with our flow cytometry data , we employed density estimation using a Gaussian kernel with fixed bandwidth .
This method replaces each data point with a Gaussian basis function of constant variance .
While this method is typically used to smooth data , namely to approximate a discrete histogram with a continuous function , we employed it to artificially introduce noise into our model .
Our motivation was simply to obtain a better qualitative fit to the flow cytometry data where , aside from the heterogeneity , we observed variable gene expression in individual cells .
While we do not believe this variability is significant for understanding how the circuit functions , we nonetheless attempted to capture it in our model .
As we do not know the origins of this variability ( e.g. stochastic gene expression , measurement error , etc ) , we simply assumed that there was an additive Gaussian noise term in the model , effectively what density estimation does .
We note that Mande and coworkers previously published a mathematical model of the SPI1 gene circuit [ 66,67 ] .
While there is substantial overlap between their model and ours , the Mande model does not account for the critical role of positive feedback on HilD expression , a key finding in our experimental investigations .
More significantly , their model does not include HilE .
As a consequence , the major conclusion drawn from the analysis of our model regarding the activation threshold can not be obtained from theirs .

We included this last state variable , G , to better match the model to our experimental data .
Otherwise , we needed to account for the fraction of HilD bound to HilE ( X ) and the associated differences in the stabilities of the respective moieties .

t003 ð8Þ ð9Þ PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 13 July 2010  Volume 6  Issue 7  e1001025 Regulation of the SPI1 Type Three Secretion System In our simulations , we first generated the pseudo random variable t l and then simulated the model using this value .
The value for t l denotes the time when the P hilD promoter is activated in an individual cell .
To model this transition , we employed the Heaviside step function , which has a value zero when the argument is negative and one when positive .
Thus , when induced , the P hilD promoter undergoes a step - like increase in activity .
We then repeated this procedure multiple times in order to gather statistics for an ensemble of cells .
With regards to the model parameters , insufficient data are available to accurately and uniquely estimate them .
However , as our goal was simply to construct a model that captured the general trends observed in the data , we simply choose numerical values for the parameters that provided a good qualitative fit .
In these regards , the model is only semi - quantitative given the subjective basis of our parameterization .
That said , the model captures our current understanding of the SPI1 gene circuit and provides a reasonable fit to the data as documented in the main text .
Numerical solution The set of coupled ordinary differential equations comprising the model were solved in Matlab 7.2 ( The Mathworks , http : / / www.mathworks.com ) using the ode15s routine where the initial conditions of all state variables where set to zero .
To account for random initiation times , the model was simulated 1000 times using the built - in random number generator .
The Matlab m - file used to generate the figures is provided as supplemental information .
