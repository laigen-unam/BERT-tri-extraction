177 , No. 15 0021 - 9193/95 / $ 04.00 0 Transcriptional Autoregulation of the Salmonella typhimurium phoPQ Operon FERNANDO C. SONCINI , ELEONORA GARCÍA VÉSCOVI , AND EDUARDO A. GROISMAN * Department of Molecular Microbiology , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri 63110 The Salmonella typhimurium PhoP - PhoQ two - component regulatory system controls the expression of several genes , some of which are necessary for virulence .
During a screening for PhoP - regulated genes , we identified the phoPQ operon as a PhoP - activated locus .
- Galactosidase activity originating from phoPQ - lac transcriptional fusions required the presence of both the transcriptional regulator PhoP and its cognate sensor - kinase PhoQ .
At low concentrations , PhoQ stimulated expression of phoPQ - lac transcriptional - fusions .
However , larger amounts of PhoQ protein without a concomitant increase in PhoP failed to activate phoPQ - lac fusions .
Two different transcripts are produced from the phoPQ operon during exponential - growth .
These transcripts define two promoters : phoPp 1 , which requires both PhoP and PhoQ for activity and which is environmentally regulated , and phoPp 2 , which remains active in the absence of PhoP and PhoQ but which is slightly stimulated by these proteins .
The pattern of transcriptional autoregulation was also observed at the protein level with anti - PhoP antibodies .
In sum , autoregulation of the phoPQ operon provides several levels of control for the PhoP - PhoQ regulon .
First , environmental signals would stimulate PhoQ to phosphorylate the PhoP protein that is produced at basal levels from the PhoP - PhoQ - independent promoter .
Then , phospho - PhoP would activate transcription of phoPp 1 , resulting in larger amounts of PhoP and PhoQ and increased expression of PhoP - activated genes .
A return to basal levels could be mediated by a posttranscriptional mechanism by which translation of the mRNA produced from phoPp 1 is inhibited .

Salmonellae are facultative intracellular pathogens responsible for several disease syndromes in a wide variety of animal species .
In humans , they have been implicated in four pathological conditions : typhoid fever , gastroenteritis ( food poisoning ) , bacteremia , and the asymptomatic carrier state ( 14 ) .
Certain Salmonella serotypes have a very narrow host range , while others are poorly host adapted and cause distinct diseases in different hosts .
For example , typhoid fever is primarily caused by the human - adapted Salmonella typhi , while Salmonella typhimurium , the leading serotype associated with gastroenteritis in humans , causes a typhoid - like disease in susceptible mice ( 16 ) .
The ability to genetically manipulate S. typhimurium and the availability of excellent models of infection have allowed the identification of many of the virulence determinants that enable Salmonella spp. to adapt and prosper within different host environments .
In S. typhimurium , virulence is controlled at the transcriptional level by several proteins , including the RpoS sigma factor ( 7 ) , the cyclic AMP - binding protein CRP ( 4 ) , and the two - component regulatory systems OmpR - EnvZ ( 6 ) and PhoP - PhoQ ( 8 , 11 , 13 , 28 ) .
The PhoP - PhoQ system was originally identified as a virulence determinant by the intramacrophage survival defect of S. typhimurium phoP mutants ( 8 , 9 ) .
A virulence role for phoP was independently demonstrated by others investigating regulatory loci necessary for virulence ( 11 , 28 ) .
The phoP locus encodes two proteins , PhoP and PhoQ , with homology to the regulators - receivers and the sensors - transmitters of the two - component family , respectively ( 13 , 28 ) .
PhoQ is predicted to be an inner membrane protein that phosphorylates and dephosphorylates the putative DNA - binding protein PhoP in response to environmental changes .
The PhoP - PhoQ system is peculiar in that both null mutations in either phoP or phoQ as well as a constitutive allele mapping to phoQ result in attenuation for virulence ( 9 , 29 ) .
As expected for the pleiotropic role of the PhoP - PhoQ system , several phenotypes have been associated with mutations in the phoPQ operon , including hypersusceptibility to antimicrobial peptides ( 8 , 15 , 30 , 32 ) and acid - pH ( 10 ) , deficiency in epithelial cell invasion ( 1 ) , and the inability to survive within macrophages ( 9 ) and to alter antigen presentation ( 41 ) .
It has been estimated that some 40 polypeptides are regulated by PhoP - PhoQ ( 29 ) and that at least 9 of these proteins are induced within the macrophage ( 2 ) .
Only two PhoP - activated genes have been cloned and sequenced : phoN ( 17 , 22 ) and pagC ( 35 ) , encoding a nonspecific acid phosphatase and outer membrane protein , respectively .
Upstream of the phoN open reading frame , there is a region in which 13 of 16 nucleotides are identical to a DNA segment present upstream of the phoP coding region ( 13 , 17 ) .
If this sequence corresponded to a PhoP - binding site , then PhoP could be involved in controlling transcription of the phoPQ operon .
For example , the homologous system PhoB - PhoR is positively autoregulated at the level of transcription .
PhoB binds to the Pho box , a sequence present in the promoter regions of several PhoB - regulated genes , including the phoBR operon ( 25 , 26 ) .
During a search for PhoP - regulated genes , we identified the phoPQ operon as a PhoP - regulated locus .
In this paper , we report a molecular genetic analysis of autoregulation of phoPQ in S. typhimurium .
We establish that full expression of phoPQ requires both PhoP and PhoQ , that two promoters are used to transcribe the phoPQ operon , and that these promoters differ in their response to and dependence on PhoP - PhoQ .

( 23 ) , pEG9014 , pEG9050 , and pEG9071 are shown in Fig. 1 .
Luria - Bertani ( LB ) and green agar plates as well as LB broth were prepared as described previously ( 27 ) .
Ampicillin and kanamycin ( both from Sigma ) were used at 50 g/ml each , 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - - D - galactopyranoside ( X - Gal ; Jersey Lab Supply ) was used at 64 g/ml , and isopropyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ; U.S. Biochemicals ) was used at 0.1 mM .
Phage P22 lysates were prepared and used as described previously ( 5 ) .
Plasmid DNA was introduced into the different strains by phage P22 - mediated transduction with lysates prepared in plasmid - containing strains or by electroporation with a Bio - Rad apparatus according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
MudJ is the mini Mu derivative originally designated MudI1734 by Castilho et al. ( 3 ) .
MudJ insertions in the phoPQ operon were isolated with a P22 lysate grown in strain TT10288 to infect either 14028s or MS7953s/pEG9014 .
EG9266 and EG9267 were constructed by transducing phoQ5996 : : Tn10 from MS5996s into EG5170 and EG5172 , respectively .
EG9315 and EG9316 were constructed by transducing phoP7953 : : Tn10 from MS7953s into EG5170 and EG5172 , respectively .
DNA biochemistry and molecular biological techniques .
Plasmid DNA was prepared by the boiling method ( 20 ) .
Other molecular biological techniques were taken from Sambrook et al. ( 37 ) .
To construct pEG9014 , a PCR - generated fragment harboring the phoP coding region was cloned into the HindIII and filled - in BamHI sites of pUHE21 - 2lacI q ( 23 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
Plasmid pEG9050 was made by cloning a PCR - generated fragment harboring the phoQ coding region into the HindIII and filled - in BamHI sites of pUHE21 - 2lacI q .
Plasmid pEG9071 was generated by ligating the phoPQ - containing 3.8 - kb NsiI - EcoRI fragment from pEG5433 ( 14 ) with pEG9014 DNA that had been digested with NsiI and HindIII .
EcoRI and HindIII were filled in with the Klenow fragment before ligation .
That plasmid pEG9014 harbored an insert whose sequence is identical to that of wild - type phoP was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis .
To localize the site of insertion of the MudJ elements in the phoPQ operon , we used PCR to amplify the chromosomal DNA with primers 312 ( 5 - GTGGATC CGGTACCTGGTCGACGAACTTA - 3 ) and 11838 ( 5 - CGTGAAACGCTT TCGCG - 3 ) , which correspond to the 5 promoter region of phoP and to the right ( attR ) end of MudJ , respectively .
The precise position of MudJ in EG9252 was determined by DNA sequencing of the PCR product by the dideoxynucleotide chain - termination method with Sequenase version 2.0 ( U.S. Biochemicals ) , - 35 S - dATP ( Amersham ) , and primer 312 .
To determine the site of transcription initiation of the phoPQ operon , we conducted primer - extension analysis with total RNA and two different primers , 366 ( 5 - ATCCTCTACAACCAGTACGCGCATCAT - 3 ) and 369 ( 5 - GAATC CTGGAGCTGAACCTTCAGGTGG - 3 ) .
The primers were end labeled with polynucleotide kinase and hybridized at 42 C overnight with 15 g of total RNA .
Super Script II RNase H reverse transcriptase ( Gibco BRL ) was used to extend the mixture .
The cDNA products were examined by electrophoresis through 6 % polyacrylamide -- 8 M urea gels .
To map the exact transcriptional start sites , sequencing reactions were performed on the phoPQ - containing plasmid pEG5381 with the same 32 P - labeled primer that was used for the primer - extension reactions .
Enzymatic determinations and Western blot ( immunoblot ) analysis .
- Galactosidase activity ( 27 ) was determined with overnight cultures grown in LB broth containing 50 g of ampicillin per ml and either 0 or 0.7 mM IPTG .
Detection of PhoP in Western blots was carried out by loading sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -- 10 % polyacrylamide gels with 30 g of protein corresponding to wholecell extracts prepared from overnight cultures grown in LB broth .
Western blot analysis was performed as described previously ( 34 ) with rabbit antibodies raised against a maltose - binding protein -- PhoP hybrid protein and purified with purified PhoP protein .

RESULTS Identification of phoPQ as a PhoP - regulated locus .
During a screening for PhoP - regulated loci , we identified a strain harboring a MudJ insertion that mapped to the phoPQ operon and whose - galactosidase activity was dependent on PhoP .
MudJ is a derivative of bacteriophage Mu that carries a pro- 4366 SONCINI ET AL. .
moterless lac operon segment near its right end , and insertions in the correct transcriptional orientation may result in the production of - galactosidase ( 3 ) .
MudJ insertions were originally isolated in strain MS7953s/pEG9014 , harboring a chromosomal phoP : : Tn10 and a plasmid with phoP under the control of a derivative of the lac promoter ( Fig. 1 ) .
Mutants were patched onto two LB X - Gal plates , one of which contained the gratuitous inducer of the lac promoter , IPTG .
Colonies that exhibited differences in - galactosidase activity were candidates for harboring fusions to PhoP - regulated genes .
These candidates were purified , the MudJ was transduced into both wild - type and phoP : : Tn10 strains , and the - galactosidase activities exhibited by the new pair of strains were compared .
Differences in - galactosidase activities for isogenic wild - type and phoP mutant strains were observed for the majority of these mutants .
One MudJ insertion exhibited anomalous behavior in that the transductants of wild - type and phoP mutant strains displayed the same levels of - galactosidase .
This was in contrast to the phenotype of the original MudJ mutant ( strain EG9252 ) , which exhibited differences upon induction of plasmid - encoded phoP .
Moreover , the MudJ transductant of the wild - type strain was sensitive to the antimicrobial peptide protamine and failed to produce nonspecific acid phosphatase activity , phenotypes that are characteristic of strains with null alleles of phoP or phoQ ( 12 ) .
That this mutant harbored an insertion in the phoP locus was confirmed in phage transduction experiments .
Using a phage P22 lysate grown in EG9252 / pEG9014 as the donor and the wild - type strain 14028s as the recipient , we established a tight linkage of the MudJ with phoP : : Tn10 : 98 % of the kanamycin - resistant transductants ( 49 of 50 ) were also resistant to tetracycline .
Therefore , we had isolated a lac gene fusion to the phoPQ locus whose activity was modulated by PhoP ( strain EG9252 in Table 2 ) .
Analysis of different phoPQ : : lac gene fusion strains .
Over the last few years , our laboratory has isolated several MudJ insertions in the phoPQ operon on the basis of their inability to produce nonspecific acid phosphatase and their linkage to purB .
We investigated whether two such mutants ( EG5170 and EG5172 ) , harboring MudJ insertions in the same transcriptional orientation as that of the phoPQ genes , exhibited the same regulatory behavior as strain EG9252 ( Fig. 2 ) .
Mutants EG5170 and EG5172 were transformed with the phoP - containing plasmid pEG9014 , and - galactosidase activity was determined in extracts prepared from cells grown under both inducing and noninducing conditions for lacp - controlled PhoP ( 0.7 and 0 mM IPTG , respectively ) .
In contrast to the results obtained with EG9252 , no differences in - galactosidase activity could be detected for derivatives of EG5170 and EG5172 harboring the phoP plasmid upon induction for PhoP expression ( Table 2 ) .
To establish the molecular basis for the dissimilar results obtained with strains EG9252 , EG5170 , and EG5172 , we determined the site of MudJ insertion within the phoPQ operon in the three mutants .
We used PCR to amplify the DNA segment between a region upstream of the phoPQ promoter and the right end of MudJ and ran the PCR products on an agarose gel ( Fig. 2C ) .
The MudJ was localized to the phoP and phoQ open reading frames in EG5170 and EG5172 , respectively , and upstream of the phoP start codon in EG9252 .
Apart from the particular position of each MudJ insertion , EG9252 differed from EG5170 and EG5172 in that it harbored a Tn10 insertion at the 3 end of phoP .
A promoter within Tn10 ( 24 ) could provide a low level of phoQ transcription sufficient to mediate phosphorylation of PhoP , which could then activate transcription at the phoPQ promoter .

The numbers at the left are base pairs .
PhoQ is required for PhoP - mediated activation of phoPQ .
To investigate the role of PhoQ in autoregulation , we constructed a series of isogenic derivatives of EG5170 and EG5172 harboring Tn10 insertions in either phoP or phoQ.We used the phoP7953 : : Tn10 present in EG9252 , which had been localized to the 121 - bp PvuII - EcoRV fragment in the 3 end of the phoP coding region , and the phoQ5996 : : Tn10 , which had been mapped to the 5 end of phoQ ( 13 ) .
The resulting strains harbored a MudJ and a Tn10 within the phoPQ operon ( Fig. 2B ) .
These strains were transformed with the phoP - containing plasmid pEG9014 or the plasmid vector , and - galactosidase activities were determined under both inducing and noninducing conditions ( Table 2 ) .

Values are the averages of two independent experiments done in duplicate .
The values 0 mM and 0.7 mM refer to the final concentrations of IPTG in the assay .
c Induction coefficient refers to the ratio of - galactosidase activities obtained with 0.7 and 0 mM IPTG .
EG9252 , exhibited an increase in - galactosidase activity upon induction of the lac promoter when harboring pEG9014 but not when carrying the plasmid vector .
This result suggested that a promoter within the Tn10 in phoP was transcribing phoQ .
Indeed , no induction could be observed in EG9266 , an isogenic derivative harboring a Tn10 within phoQ rather than phoP .
As expected , the phoP : : Tn10 and phoQ : : Tn10 derivatives of EG5172 ( EG9316 and EG9267 , respectively ) , which harbors a MudJ in phoQ , could not express - galactosidase .
Cumulatively , these results indicate that autoregulation requires both phoP ( provided by the pEG9014 plasmid ) and phoQ ( transcribed by a promoter within the Tn10 present in phoP ) .
To further examine the role of PhoQ in autoregulation , we studied the behavior of strains harboring pEG9050 , a plasmid isogenic to pEG9014 but with phoQ under the control of the lac derivative promoter ( Fig. 1 ) .
The phoQ defect of strain EG5172 could be rescued upon transformation with pEG9050 : this strain produced 6.5 times more - galactosidase activity relative to that of derivatives containing pEG9014 or the plasmid vector .
These data were obtained with uninduced cells because induction of phoQ in pEG9050 decreased the - galactosidase activity fivefold relative to that of the uninduced culture .
The activation effect of PhoQ was at the phoPQ promoter because derivatives of EG5172 with Tn10 insertions upstream of the MudJ ( EG9267 and EG9316 ) expressed the same low levels of - galactosidase in pEG9050 - transformed cells as in cells transformed with the plasmid vector ( Table 2 ) .
Plasmid pEG9050 did not stimulate or repress production of - galactosidase in strains harboring insertions within phoP ( EG9252 , EG5170 , EG9266 , and EG9315 ) ( Table 2 ) .
These results indicate that low levels of PhoQ stimulate expression of phoPQ , probably by phosphorylating PhoP , and confirm the requirement of PhoP for autoregulation .
Regulation of phoPQ : : lacZ gene fusions by a plasmid harboring the phoPQ operon .
The experiments described in the previous sections were conducted with strains in which phoP was expressed from the chromosome and phoQ was expressed from a plasmid , or vice versa .
We examined the behavior of the seven mutant strains carrying plasmid pEG9071 , a pUHE21 - 2lacI q derivative harboring the whole phoPQ operon under control of the lac derivative promoter ( Fig. 1 ) .
Induction of phoPQ resulted in an increase in - galactosidase activity in EG9252 , EG5170 , EG9266 , and EG9315 ( Table 2 ) , confirming that both PhoP and PhoQ are necessary for autoregulation of the phoPQ operon .
As was observed with EG5172/pEG9050 , introduction of pEG9071 into EG5172 resulted in 8 to 10 times higher - galactosidase activity relative to that of strains harboring the plasmid vector .
However , whereas induction of phoQ in EG5172/pEG9050 resulted in the repression of - galactosidase activity , expression remained high in EG5172 / pEG9071 upon induction of phoPQ .
Two promoters transcribe the phoPQ operon .
To identify the transcription start site ( s ) of the phoPQ operon , we performed primer - extension experiments with RNA prepared from cells harvested in late exponential phase or following overnight growth .
Two RNA species were detected in an exponentially growing wild - type Salmonella culture ( Fig. 3 ) .
These RNAs correspond to two distinct transcription start sites and are not artifacts of primer - extension because they were detected with two different primers and in S1 - mapping experiments ( data not shown ) .
The transcripts differ in 11 nucleotides and display distinct regulatory features .
First , both transcripts were detected in cells harvested in logarithmic phase , but their levels were very much reduced in stationary - phase cells .
Second , the shorter transcript was produced in wild - type cells and phoP and phoQ mutants , whereas the longer transcript could be detected only in wild - type cells .
This set of experiments demonstrated that two promoters transcribe the phoPQ operon : phoPp 1 , which is dependent on PhoP and PhoQ for activity , and phoPp 2 , which does not require PhoP or PhoQ but which is slightly stimulated by their presence .
The relative strengths and the regulation of the two promoters were evaluated by analyzing the levels of - galactosidase activity in different mutants .
In strain EG9252 , the MudJ is present between the transcription start sites for the two phoPQ promoters ( Fig. 3 ) , and so the low levels of - galactosidase reflect the activity of phoPp 1 .
In contrast , the lac operon in the FIG. 3 .

isogenic EG9315 strain which is expected to be transcribed from the two phoPQ promoters expressed higher levels of - galactosidase activity ( Table 2 ) .
Interestingly , the activation ratios for PhoP - and PhoP - PhoQ - induced cells were much higher for EG9252 ( 23 to 36 times ) relative to that for EG9315 ( 6.3 times ) ( Table 2 ) .
We investigated the - galactosidase activity produced by strains bearing phoP or phoPQ plasmids and incubated with different amounts of IPTG .
In strains transcribing lac from the two promoters ( EG5170 , EG9315 , and EG5172 ) , maximum activity was detected at 70 M IPTG and no further increases were found upon growth in the presence of 0.7 or 2.5 mM IPTG ( Fig. 4A ) .

These results correspond to one of two independent experiments performed in duplicate .
strains EG9252/pEG9014 and EG9252/pEG9071 climbed as the concentration of IPTG increased from 70 M to 2.5 mM ( Fig. 4B ) .
These results reflect the activities of cells grown in LB broth to stationary - phase .
The relative strengths of the two promoters may be different under other growth - conditions .
As was stated above , the transcripts produced from phoPp 1 and phoPp 2 differ in 11 nucleotides ( Fig. 3 ) .
Secondary structure predictions for the corresponding mRNAs indicate that the longer transcript could generate a stem - loop structure that would include the Shine - Dalgarno region for phoP ( Fig. 5 ) .
Predicted secondary structures corresponding to the 5 regions of the mRNAs produced from the two phoP promoters ( p phoP - 1 and p phoP - 2 ) , as predicted by the FOLD and SQUIGGLES programs ( Genetics Computer Group ) .
The predicted stem in the transcript produced from phoPp 1 ( p phoP - 1 ) would occlude the ribosome - binding site ( rbs ) for phoP .
The predicted structure , which would have a G of 3.9 kcal / mol , could prevent translation of phoP and also potentially of phoQ since the latter does not have a ribosome - binding site and its translation appears to be coupled to that of PhoP .
The stabilization and destabilization of these stem - loop structures could have a regulatory effect on the expression of PhoP and PhoQ .
Autoregulation detected at the protein level .
We investigated whether the regulatory pattern of phoPQ observed at the transcriptional level was also seen at the protein level .
Using purified anti - PhoP antibodies , we performed Western blot analyses of protein extracts prepared from the different mutant strains described above .
PhoP was detected in wild - type cells and at much lower levels in the phoQ mutant strains EG5172 and EG9267 ( Fig. 6 ) .
The reduced levels of PhoP are probably due to the absence of PhoQ to activate the system .
As expected , no PhoP could be found in EG9316 ( an EG5172 derivative with phoP : : Tn10 ) or in other strains with insertions in phoP ( EG9252 , EG5170 , EG9266 , and EG9315 ) .
DISCUSSION We investigated the regulation of the phoPQ operon of S. typhimurium , which encodes the transcriptional regulator PhoP and the putative kinase - phosphatase PhoQ .
We established that phoPQ is transcribed from two promoters , one of which is positively autoregulated by both PhoP and PhoQ .
Autoregulation was originally detected in EG9252 , a strain with properties that made the discovery of this phenomenon possible .
These properties include the presence of two appropriately located transposons : a Tn10 in the 3 end of phoP that provided a promoter for low levels of PhoQ expression ( 24 ) and a MudJ downstream of the PhoP - dependent promoter phoPp 1 but upstream of the start site for phoPp 2 , a promoter that is still expressed in the absence of PhoP and PhoQ .
Transcription originating from Tn10 was low ( compare 15 to 20 U of - galactosidase in EG9316 with 110 to 130 U coming from the phoPQ promoter in EG5172 ) , but sufficient PhoQ was produced to appropriately modulate PhoP .
Our discovery of autogenous regulation of phoPQ is in contrast to proposals by Miller and coworkers that phoP is not autoregulated ( 19 ) .
Autoregulation requires both PhoP and PhoQ .
In strains harboring phoP - lac fusions , increased - galactosidase activity was detected only upon transformation with plasmids carrying phoP or phoPQ ( Table 2 ) .
Similarly , in mutants with phoQlac gene fusions , induction was observed only in strains carrying phoQ or phoPQ plasmids ( Table 2 ) .
On the basis of the similarity of PhoP - PhoQ to other two - component systems ( 13 , 28 ) , we predict that PhoQ will phosphorylate - dephosphorylate 4370 SONCINI ET AL. .
Model for autoregulation of the phoPQ operon .
In a repressing environment , the phoPQ operon is transcribed from phoPp 2 ( p phoP - 2 ) .
When the activating signal is present , the sequential phosphorylation of PhoQ and PhoP takes place on proteins translated from the mRNA made from phoPp 2 .
This results in the production of phospho - PhoP , which can activate transcription from phoPp 1 ( p phoP - 1 ) and to a lower extent from phoPp 2 .
A return to basal levels of expression could be achieved by inhibiting the translation of the mRNA produced from phoPp 1 or by the activation of the phosphatase activity of PhoQ as described in the text .
PhoP in response to environmental changes ( 33 ) .
Then , our results are consistent with a model that predicts the phosphorylated form of PhoP to be the actual transcriptional activator of phoPQ .
The unphosphorylated form of PhoP is unlikely to compete with phospho - PhoP for a PhoP - binding site ( s ) in the phoPQ promoter because the transcription levels remained unchanged upon induction of PhoP expression in a phoQ mutant carrying a phoP plasmid .
Phenotypically , PhoQ behaved as both an activator and a repressor of the phoPQ operon .
Small amounts of PhoQ were sufficient to induce the PhoP - dependent expression of phoPQ .
However , overexpression of PhoQ without a concomitant increase of PhoP resulted in levels of phoPQ transcription observed in a phoQ mutant ( Table 2 and Fig. 4A ) .
These results could reflect a titration of PhoP by the overexpressed PhoQ .
Alternatively , they can be rationalized in terms of the predicted kinase and phosphatase activities of PhoQ ( 33 ) .
When the inducing signal is limiting , overexpression of PhoQ might lead to an increase in its phosphatase activity , resulting in the displacement of the equilibrium between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of PhoP .
The levels of - galactosidase in a phoQ mutant harboring the phoPQ plasmid ( EG5172/pEG9071 ) remained high upon induction of phoPQ , perhaps reflecting the fact that both PhoP and PhoQ are being overexpressed from this plasmid .
On the other hand , activation of phoPQ - lac in a phoP mutant required induction of phoP or phoPQ .
These results suggest that PhoQ acts catalytically while PhoP is required in stoichiometric amounts with respect to its target sites in the chromosome .
We have identified two promoters , phoPp 1 and phoPp 2 , transcribing the phoPQ operon .
Transcription from phoPp 1 requires phospho - PhoP because no transcript could be detected in either phoP or phoQ mutants , which should mimic noninducing conditions in the wild - type bacterium .
On the other hand , phoPp 2 was active in the absence of PhoP or PhoQ , but its activity was slightly stimulated by PhoP - PhoQ .
The promoter phoPp 1 harbors a cATAAT Pribnow box and a GTT TAT direct repeat 12 bp and 22 bp upstream .
DNA motifs recognized by other regulators , such as PhoB ( 25 , 40 ) and OmpR ( 31 , 36 , 39 ) , of the two - component family are arranged similarly in the promoters of the genes they regulate .
Analysis of phoPp 2 showed a TAgAcT 10 region and a weak 35 region ( TGTTtAtc ) which could be responsible for the PhoP - PhoQ - independent transcription .
The GTTTAT repeat proximal to phoPp 2 is 24 bp upstream of its 10 region .
The promoter activity of phoPp 1 ( measured as - galactosidase in EG9252/pEG9014 ) was proportional to the level of PhoP expression ( Fig. 4B ) .
On the other hand , small amounts of PhoP were sufficient to achieve maximum levels of - galactosidase in strains transcribed from the two promoters ( i.e. , EG5170 / pEG9071 and EG9315 and EG5172 transformed with either pEG9014 or pEG9071 ) ( Fig. 4A ) .
Our data suggest that the PhoP - PhoQ regulon is subjected to several levels of regulation ( Fig. 7 ) .
First , environmental changes may promote phosphorylation of PhoQ and the subsequent phosphorylation of PhoP on proteins made from the mRNA produced from phoPp 2 .
Then , a positive feedback loop would stimulate transcription from phoPp 1 , resulting in increased levels of both PhoP and PhoQ and a concomitant activation of PhoP - activated genes .
Positive autoregulation has been observed in other two - component regulatory systems , including those of the homologous phoBR operon of Escherichia coli ( 18 ) , the virA and virG genes of Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( 42 ) , and the bvgAS operon in Bordetella pertussis .
Interestingly , bvgAS is also transcribed from several promoters , two of which respond to environmental signals via BvgA - BvgS ( 38 ) .
One can envision several scenarios that could mediate the return of the PhoP - PhoQ regulon to basal levels of expression .
One possibility is for PhoQ to have phosphatase activity upon phospho - PhoP and for this property to be stimulated by the disappearance of the stimulating signal .
Alternatively , PhoP or phospho - PhoP may be intrinsically unstable , requiring continuous synthesis to achieve high levels of PhoP - activated determinants .
A third possibility is that PhoP or another protein may help stabilize the stem - loop structure that may be formed when phoPQ is transcribed from phoPp 1 ( Fig. 5 ) .
The formation of this stem would occlude the Shine - Dalgarno region and prevent translation of phoP .
Further experiments are required to determine whether these or other models explain the regulatory features of this locus .
