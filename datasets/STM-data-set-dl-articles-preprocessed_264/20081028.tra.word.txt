Inactivation of ramA led to increased expression of 14 SPI - 1 genes and decreased expression of three SPI - 2 genes , and it altered expression of ribosomal biosynthetic genes and several amino - acid biosynthetic pathways .
Furthermore , disruption of ramA led to decreased survival within RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages and attenuation within the BALB/c ByJ mouse model .
Highly overexpressed ramA led to increased expression of genes encoding multidrug resistance ( MDR ) efflux pumps , including acrAB , acrEF , and tolC .
Decreased expression of 34 Salmonella pathogenicity island ( SPI ) 1 and 2 genes , decreased SipC production , decreased adhesion to and survival within macrophages , and decreased colonization of Caenorhabditis elegans were also seen .
Disruption of ramR led to the increased expression of ramA , acrAB , and tolC , but not to the same level as when ramA was overexpressed on a plasmid .
Inactivation of ramR had a more limited effect on pathogenicity gene expression .
In silico analysis of a suggested RamA - binding consensus sequence identified target genes , including ramR , acrA , tolC , sipABC , and ssrA .
This study demonstrates that the regulation of a mechanism of MDR and expression of virulence genes show considerable overlap , and we postulate that such a mechanism is dependent on transcriptional activator concentration and promoter sensitivity .
However , we have no evidence to support the hypothesis that increased MDR via RamA regulation of AcrAB - TolC gives rise to a hypervirulent strain .
Multidrug efflux pumps , such as the resistance - nodulationdivision ( RND ) superfamily member AcrAB - TolC in the Enterobacteriaceae , export many substrates , including antibiotics ( 9 , 27 , 29 , 49 , 51 , 64 ) .
AcrAB - TolC and homologous efflux systems are important in the pathogenicity of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( 10 , 14 ) and other bacterial species ( 11 , 15 , 16 ) .
Recent work by our laboratory in S. Typhimurium has shown that following the disruption of acrA , acrB , ortolC , a phenotype of decreased pathogenicity was associated with global changes in expression of genes involved in virulence ( such as those in SPI - 1 ) , chemotaxis , and motility ( 70 ) .
Regulation of RND efflux pumps has been widely studied in Escherichia coli , with the global AraC/XylS family regulators marA , soxS , and rob having been shown to activate expression of efflux pumps ( 5 , 8 , 46 , 52 , 71 ) .
Mechanistically , this is achieved via the binding , and subsequent activation , of discrete but degenerate nucleotide sequences within regulon genes , Group , School of Immunity and Infection , College of Medical and Dental Sciences .

known as mar - , rob - , or soxboxes ( 30 , 35 , 42 , 43 ) .
E. coli marA is part of the marRAB operon , linked to another operon , marCD , of unknown function .
Expression of both is controlled from the same operator site , marO ( 20 ) .
Regulation of E. coli marA is provided through the local repressor marR ( 62 ) , which controls the transcription of marA by binding to marO , preventing autoactivation of marA , which competes with marR for the marbox of marO ( 43 ) .
Expression of marA can be induced by various compounds and conditions , including exposure to bile - salts ( 54 ) , salicylate , cyclohexane , and the antibiotics tetracycline and chloramphenicol ( 65 ) .
The regulon of marA in E. coli comprises up to 60 genes , including acrAB , tolC , ompF , and zwf ( 4 , 8 , 27 , 52 ) .
In E. coli , the level of soxS is controlled by the activator soxR , in contrast to the repressor activity of marR upon marA .
Activation of soxR by superoxide stress induces expression of soxS and the subsequent induction of the soxRS regulon ( 23 ) .
Salmonellae , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Enterobacter aerogenes contain ramA , an additional member of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional activators , which is absent from E. coli and Shigella spp. .
Overexpression of ramA confers multidrug resistance ( 6 , 19 , 28 , 60 , 67 ) through induction of acrAB and tolC ( 6 ) .
Regulation of ramA is provided locally by ramR ( STM0580 ) , whose function can be ablated by internal point mutations and insertions within the helix - turn - helix motif ( 3 , 57 ) and/or deletions within the DNA - binding region between ramR and ramA ( 73 ) .
All such events confer multidrug resistance ( MDR ) , presumably through the prevention of RamR binding to an operator sequence near ramA , and therefore the 1607 1608 BAILEY ET AL. .
Strains used in this study S. Typhimurium strain code Genotype Description Reference L354 SL1344 Wild - type strain 72 L133 SL1344 ramA : : aph P22 - transduced ramA disruptant 6 L786 L133 pTRChisA - ramA ramA under overexpression control of IPTG - inducible plasmid 6 L1007 SL1344 ramR : : aph P22 - transduced ramR disruptant 58 subsequent relaxation of RamR repression at the ramA promoter ( 3 , 57 ) .
This model is similar to the mechanism of repression of E. coli marRA ( 5 , 62 ) .
Within S. Typhimurium , marA , soxS , and rob appear to play a lesser role in the regulation of MDR , and overexpression of marA and soxS is rarely observed within MDR clinical isolates ( 3 , 29 , 51 ) .
Furthermore , induction of acrAB by indole is regulated through ramA , independent of marA , soxS , orrob ( 48 ) .
Recently , we showed that inactivation of acrB or tolC was associated with overexpression of ramA ( 70 ) .
Prieto et al. ( 53 ) also showed that the presence or absence of an outer membrane protein in S. Typhimurium , AsmA , can affect marA expression .
Taken together , these data suggest the existence of a feedback loop of regulation between AraC/XylS regulators such as marA and ramA and genes within their regulons .
In order to define the regulon of RamA , we investigated the effects of inactivation of ramR and the inactivation or artificial overexpression of ramA on the transcriptome of S. Typhimurium .
Our data indicate that in addition to the regulation of multidrug efflux pump and accessory genes , expression of ramA influences expression of virulence genes , pathogenicity effectors , and genes within amino - acid biosynthetic pathways .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and media used .
Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
All strains were derived from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 ( 72 ) .
The ramA : : aph disruptant was constructed as described previously ( 22 ) and then subsequently P22 - transduced into SL1344 to avoid possible red recombinasemediated mutations .
To overexpress ramA , pTRChisA - ramA ( 67 ) was transformed into L133 ( ramA : : aph ) .
Ampicillin ( Sigma - Aldrich ; 50 g/ml ) was used in cultures to ensure retention of the plasmid , except during - growth for RNA preparations for gene expression profiling .
This was to prevent altered gene expression due to ampicillin exposure .
pTRChis - ramA was not lost during this short ( 3 - h ) period ( data not shown ) .
Expression of ramA was quantified in both the presence and absence of 1 mM IPTG ( isopropyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ) , with IPTG induction giving a large increase in expression ( 6 ) .
Therefore , where ramA induction was required , sterile IPTG was added to the relevant growth media to a concentration of 1 mM .
Luria - Bertani ( LB ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and MOPS ( morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ) minimal - medium ( Teknova Inc. ) broth were used throughout this study .
RNA extraction and transcriptional analyses .
Overnight cultures of S. Typhimurium SL1344 and the test strain were grown in MOPS minimal - medium at 37 °C as previously described ( 7 ) .
Microarray experiments were carried out exactly as described by Webber et al. , ( 70 ) using the Pan - Salmonella Generation IV array generated at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute ( Hinxton , United Kingdom ) .
From each strain , three biological and two technical replicate RNA preparations were made .
RNA was extracted and quantified as described previously ( 6 , 70 ) .
RNA ( 25 g ) was used to generate probes labeled with either Cy - 3 or Cy - 5 ( GE Healthcare ) using Superscript III ( Invitrogen ) .
For each microarray experiment , the wild - type ( SL1344 ) RNA was pooled after quantification to provide a common reference .
Data were analyzed with Bioconductor ( 56 ) and Pathway Tools ( 37 ) .
Data with a B value ( log odds value ) of 0 and a P value of 0.05 were taken as significant .
Validation of microarray data .
Reverse transcription PCRs ( RT - PCRs ) were performed as previously ( 6 , 24 ) with a selection of SPI genes shown to be differentially expressed in the microarray experiments : hilC , invF , sipC , sopB , ssrA , and ssaJ ( Table 3 ) .
Furthermore , expression of ramA , acrB , and tolC was also determined .
In silico analysis of putative rambox .
Nikaido et al. ( 48 ) described a putative degenerate rambox sequence , 5 ATGGCACG [ A/T ] AA [ A/C ] [ A/G ] CCAA [ A / C ] [ C/T ] [ A/T ] 3 .
To establish whether this rambox was common to genes found to be differentially regulated by modification of ramAR , anin silico pattern search was performed against the S. Typhimurium LT2 genome ( 45 ) within xBase ( 17 ) and using the `` fuzznuc '' pattern search algorithm within EMBOSS ( 59 ) .
Given the degree of degeneracy known to be present in mar - and soxboxes ( 32 , 44 ) , various allowances of up to 6 mismatches were permitted and no restrictions were placed upon the search location .
Data were cross - compared with transcriptomic data using the Microsoft Excel VLOOKUP function .
Protein purification and Western blotting of SipC .
Protein purification and Western blotting were performed exactly as described previously ( 47 , 70 ) .
Adhesion and intracellular survival assays .
Adhesion to and intracellular survival within eukaryotic macrophages ( RAW 264.7 ) by S. Typhimurium SL1344 and strains derived therefrom were assessed as described previously ( 14 ) .
A two - tailed Student 's t test was used to assess significance , using a P value of 0.05 as a cutoff .
Experimental infections using the murine model of infection to compare SL1344 ( wild type ) and L133 ( ramA : : aph ) were conducted essentially as previously described ( 39 ) .
Briefly , female 6 - to 8 - week - old BALB/c ByJ or C57/BL6 mice ( five mice per group ) were inoculated by the intragastric ( i.g. ) route with approximately 5 10 7 CFU of SL1344 or L133 ( ramA : : aph ) in PBS ( pH 7.4 ) .
Alternatively , mice were inoculated by the intravenous route with approximately 2.4 10 3 CFU of strain SL1344 or L133 .
Five days ( i.g. inoculation ) or four days ( intravenous inoculation ) after inoculation , mice were sacrificed and organs recovered by dissection .
The number of CFU per organ was determined by plating serial 10 - fold dilutions of homogenized tissue on LB agar plates or LB plus kanamycin ( 50 g/ml ) .
The statistical significance of differences in colonization of each organ was calculated using the Mann - Whitney test , using GraphPad Prism software .
A P value of 0.05 was considered significant .
Caenorhabditis elegans survival assays .
C. elegans strain Bristol N2 was kindly donated by Robin May ( University of Birmingham ) and was cultured using standard methods as described previously ( 13 , 61 ) .
Survival assays were performed essentially as previously ( 1 , 2 ) , with 20 larval stage 4 ( L - 4 ) C. elegans worms being picked and transferred onto each assay plate and with a minimum of 120 worms being used on three independent occasions .
Plates were incubated at 25 °C and scored daily for survival .
No effects on worm survival were seen with IPTG , kanamycin , and ampicillin at the concentrations used in the experiments .
Worms were transferred onto a fresh nematode growth medium ( NGM ) ( 33 ) plate containing the same bacterial test or control strain from the same original culture during the fertile period and reincubated at 25 °C .
A Kaplan - Meier estimate was used to determine the probability of C. elegans survival to the next day .
Survival curves were generated by plotting probability of survival ( y ) against time ( x ) .
These curves were then compared using the log rank test to establish whether the difference between two curves was statistically significant , using a chi - squared test and a derived P value of 0.05 as the significance cutoff .
Microarray data accession numbers .
Microarray datasets have been deposited in ArrayExpress ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray - as/ae/ ) with the following experiment identifiers : for ramA : : aph , E - MEXP - 2193 ; for ramR : : aph , E - MEXP - 2194 ; for pTRChisA - ramA , E - MEXP - 2195 .

Of these 223 , 119 genes were increased in expression and 104 were decreased in expression ( Fig. 1 ; also , see Table S1 in the supplemental material ) .
Comparison of the transcriptome of L1007 ( ramR : : aph ) with that of SL1344 revealed that disruption of ramR resulted in significantly altered expression of 187 genes ( 5 % of the SL1344 genome ) .
Of these 187 , 173 genes were increased in expression and 14 were decreased in expression ( Fig. 1 ; also , see Table S2 in the supplemental material ) .
Comparison of the transcriptome of L786 ( L133 pTRChisA - ramA ) with that of SL1344 revealed that overexpression of ramA resulted in significantly altered expression of 310 genes ( 8 % of the SL1344 genome ) .
Of these 310 , 158 genes were increased in expression and 152 were decreased in expression ( Fig. 1 ; also , see Table S3 in the supplemental material ) .
Comparison of the transcriptomes of L133 ( ramA : : aph ) and L1007 ( ramR : : aph ) revealed 19 common genes , 16 of which were oppositely expressed ( Fig. 1 ) .
Comparison of the transcriptomes of L133 and L786 ( pTRChis - ramA ) revealed 13 common genes ; all are pathogenicity genes .
Twelve were oppositely expressed , suggesting that they are directly affected by ramA expression ( Fig. 1 ) .
Overexpression of ramA via inactivation of ramR ( L1007 ) , or artificially on pTRC ( L786 ) , showed that 30 genes were common to both .
Of these , 23 were similarly increased or decreased in expression ( Fig. 1 ) .
Four genes were significantly differentially expressed by all three strains ; ilvE , ilvM , napF , and pckA ( Fig. 1 ) .
Of these , two ( napF and pckA ) were increased in expression in all three strains , compared with SL1344 .
Two genes ( ilvE and ilvM ) were increased in expression when ramR was inactivated but decreased in expression when ramA was inactivated or overexpressed .
Overexpression of ramA and disruption of ramRA affect expression of genes encoding efflux pumps and porins .
When ramR was inactivated , expression of ramA was increased 25 - fold ( Table 2 ) .
High - level overexpression in L786 ( pTRChisAramA ) resulted in even greater expression ( 144.3 - fold [ Table 2 ] ) .
These data were confirmed by RT - PCR ( Fig. 2D ) ( 6 ) .
After ramR disruption , expression of acrA , acrB , and tolC was increased 2.1 - to 3.4 - fold ; even greater expression of these genes ( 5.2 - to 8.7 - fold [ Table 2 ] ) was seen when ramA was highly overexpressed .
Increased expression of acrB and tolC was confirmed by RT - PCR ( 14.9 - fold and 2.6 - fold , respectively ) ( Fig. 2D ) ( 6 ) .
Increased expression of genes encoding an additional RND efflux pump , AcrEF ( 2.5 - and 3.0 - fold , respectively [ Table 2 ] ) was also seen for L786 but not L133 .
Expression of ramR , the local repressor of ramA , was decreased 0.4 - fold when ramA was highly overexpressed ( Table 2 ) , and expression of the porin gene ompF was decreased 0.2 - fold ( Table 2 ) .
No differential expression of the porin regulators ompR and envZ was observed .
RT - PCR revealed that upon inactivation of ramA , expression of acrB was decreased 0.2 - fold compared to that in SL1344 ( Fig. 2D ) .
Furthermore , after ramA inactivation , expression of genes encoding the porins OmpC and OmpX was decreased ( 0.5 - and 0.6 - fold , respectively [ Table 2 ] ) .
Inactivation of ramA increases expression of ribosomal biosynthetic genes and alters expression of genes encoding some amino - acid biosynthetic pathways .
Expression of 17 genes within the rpl and rps operons was statistically significantly increased after ramA inactivation ( 1.4 - to 2.3 - fold [ Table 2 ] ) .
Expression of 15 genes in the arg , art , and cys operons , responsible for arginine and cysteine biosynthesis , was also increased ( 4.2 - to 12.1 - fold [ Table 2 ] ) .
However , expression of 14 genes within the his , ilv , and trp operons , responsible for histidine , isoleucine , and tryptophan biosynthesis , respectively , was decreased ( 0.04 - to 0.6 - fold [ Table 2 ] ) .
Expression of genes encoding components of the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways , including adh , zwf , and pckA , was also affected by the disruption of ramA , with increased expression ( 4.1 - fold ) and decreased expression ( 0.2 - fold ) being observed ( see Table S1 in the supplemental material ) .
After disruption of ramR , expression of genes encoding proteins involved in cysteine biosynthesis , cysCDHJKNU , was statistically significantly decreased ( 0.3 - to 0.6 - fold [ Table 2 ] ) .

b - , no significant change in expression .
Disruption or high - level overexpression of ramA differentially affects expression of pathogenicity genes and proteins .
The microarray experiments with L133 ( ramA : : aph ) and L786 ( L133 pTRChisA - ramA ) revealed significantly altered expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island genes .
Inactivation of ramA increased expression of 14 genes within SPI - 1 , including effectors such as sipABCDF and regulators such as sprA and invF ( 1.6 - to 6.8 - fold [ Table 3 ] ) .
Increased expression of invF , sipC , sopB and ssrA was confirmed by RT - PCR ( Fig. 2A ) .
No changes in expression of other known regulators of SPI - 1 , such as phoPQ , pmrA , and hilC , were seen ; no differential expression of the latter was confirmed by RT - PCR ( Fig. 2A ) .
Expression of some genes within SPI - 2 , -4 , -5 , -6 , and -7 a was also altered in L133 , with expression of genes from SPI - 2 , -6 , and -7 a ( e.g. , ssaI and STM1410 ) being decreased and that of genes within SPI - 4 and -5 ( e.g. , sigD and sopE ) being increased ( Table 3 ) .
However , in contrast , when ramA was highly overexpressed ( L786 ) , decreased expression of 47 pathogenicity genes was observed , including many of the same SPI - 1 genes for which increased expression upon ramA inactivation was seen ; this was also confirmed by RT - PCR ( Fig. 2B ) .
Furthermore , RT - PCR validation also showed decreased expression of the regulatory gene hilC and the gene encoding the effector protein SopB ( Fig. 2B ) .
The RamA - dependent genes with decreased expression included those in SPI - 1 , -2 , -4 , -5 , -6 , and -7 a as well as other genes whose products are also associated with the ability of salmonellae to be pathogenic ( 0.1 - to 0.6 - fold [ Table 3 ] ) .
Of interest , high - level overexpression of ramA in L786 was associated with increased expression of slyA , a known activator of SPI - 2 ( 3.9 - fold [ Table 3 ] ) , despite the generally decreased expression of SPI - 2 genes after ramA overexpression .
Disruption of ramR , giving modest overexpression of ramA , altered expression of only one SPI - 2 gene , sseE , which was decreased 0.51 - fold ( Table 3 ) .
However , RT - PCR validation revealed similarly ( to high - level ramA overexpression ) decreased expression of SPI genes ( invF , sopB , ssrA , and ssaJ ) ( Fig. 2C ) .
To validate the decreased gene expression in L786 , expression of SipC , a SPI - 1 protein , was determined by Western blotting .
No change in SipC production was observed for SL1344 or L133 ( ramA : : aph ) ( Fig. 3 , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
As a control , IPTG was also added to both strains ; no effect was seen upon SipC production ( Fig. 3 , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
L786 decreased production of SipC , in both the absence ( 0.76 - fold ) and presence ( 0.30 - fold ) of IPTG , compared to SL1344 ( Fig. 3 , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
Furthermore , in the absence of ampicillin , SipC production was decreased further ; 0.24 - fold ( no IPTG ) and 0.20 - fold ( with IPTG ) ( Fig. 3 , lanes 7 and 8 ) compared to SL1344 .
The ability of S. Typhimurium to adhere to and survive within RAW macrophages and to colonize mice and C. elegans is RamA dependent .
As the expression of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes was differentially altered by the overexpression and inactivation of ramA , and as production of SipC was decreased by overexpression of ramA , the ability of ramA mutants to adhere to and survive within RAW 264.7 macrophages and to colonize mice and C. elegans was investigated .
Compared with SL1344 , inactivation of ramA in L133 had no significant effect on adherence ( Fig. 4A ) .
The ability of L133 to survive within RAW 264.7 macrophages was significantly impaired , however ( 0.53 - fold decrease [ Fig. 4B ] ) .
Furthermore , L133 was recovered in significantly lower numbers ( 100 - fold difference in geometric mean ) from the livers and spleens of BALB/c mice than the parental strain , following oral inoculation ( Fig. 5A ) .
192 , 2010 RamA INFLUENCES SALMONELLA VIRULENCE AND EFFLUX 1611 FIG. 2 .
RT - PCR for six SPI genes for ramA : : aph ( A ) , pTRChisA - ramA ( B ) , and ramR : : aph ( C ) ( asterisks show significant [ P 0.05 ] differences ) and RT - PCR for acrB , tolC , and ramA ( D ) ( all RT - PCR data shown are significant ; P 0.05 ) .
Black bars , microarray data ; gray bars , RT - PCR data ; dashed line , fold change of 1 ( i.e. , no change ) ; for all array changes , a B value of 0 is considered significant .
The ability of this strain to colonize the livers and spleens of BALB/c mice following intravenous inoculation was not significantly different ( Fig. 5B ) .
These data were confirmed for the C57/BL6 mice ( data not shown ) .
When ramA was highly overexpressed in L786 , the ability to adhere and survive within RAW 264.7 macrophages was significantly attenuated ( Fig. 4 ) .
Unfortunately , in the mouse experiments , pTRChisA - ramA could not be maintained , so the C. elegans model was used to further support the transcriptomic and cell culture data .
In this model , L786 was significantly ( 2 7.39 , P 0.0066 ) attenuated in its ability to kill the worm compared to SL1344 ( Fig. 6 ) .
L133 had no significant difference in pathogenicity compared to SL1344 ( 2 1.83 , P 0.18 ) ( Fig. 6 ) .
Interestingly , even though limited SPI gene expression changes were observed for L1007 , this strain was also significantly ( 2 10.24 , P 0.0014 ) attenuated compared to SL1344 ( Fig. 6 ) .
The SPI genes pckA and ilvM contain a rambox .
In silico analyses using the degenerative rambox sequence proposed by Nikaido et al. ( 48 ) revealed several targets for RamA .
These included acrA and tolC , whose expression has previously been shown to be increased by ramA overexpression ( 48 ) ( Table 4 ) .
The SPI - 1 effector genes sipA , sipB , and sipC and the SPI - 1 regulator invF all contained a putative rambox , as did the SPI - 2 gene ssaJ and the putative virulence effect gene srfB ( Table 4 ) .
However , the expression of these RamA targets was variable , suggesting that RamA can activate or repress target gene expression .
Only two genes containing a putative rambox , pckA and ilvM , were commonly expressed in all three strains ( Table 4 ) .
The expression of pckA , which encodes the gluconeogenic pathway enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase , was increased in all three strains ( 1.6 - to 2.3 - fold ) , whereas the expression of ilvM , which encodes acetolactate synthase , was decreased in L133 ( ramA : : aph ) and L786 ( L133 pTRChisAramA ) 0.5 - and 0.4 - fold , respectively , but increased in L1007 ( ramR : : aph ) ( 1.9 - fold [ Table 4 ] ) .
DISCUSSION There is mounting evidence that RamA is a transcriptional activator that regulates genes conferring MDR in various species , including the salmonellae ( 6 , 19 , 28 , 38 , 48 , 58 , 67 , 73 ) .
Therefore , we sought to resolve the regulon of ramA by comparing the transcriptomes of the wild - type SL1344 parental strain with those of three isogenic mutants in which ramA or ramR ( the local repressor of ramA ) was inactivated or in which ramA was highly overexpressed .
Given that when genes which confer MDR , such as the those encoding the RND efflux pump AcrAB - TolC , are deleted , the virulence of the bacterium is attenuated ( 3 , 14 ) , it has been hypothesized that if overexpression of the same genes occurs , there may be a concurrent increase in virulence .
Support for this hypothesis is derived from work with Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( 69 , 68 ) showing that mutants overexpressing the Mtr efflux pump genes were more virulent than their wild - type parental strain .
As hypothesized , and confirming prior studies ( 3 , 57 ) , the microarray experiments revealed that inactivation of ramR resulted in overexpression of ramA .
This is likely responsible for the increased expression of acrAB and tolC and decreased 1612 BAILEY ET AL. .

The CFU per organ of SL1344 ( circles ) and L133 ( squares ) and the geometric mean ( horizontal bar ) are indicated .
P values were calculated using the Mann - Whitney test .
The magnitude of increased expression of acrAB and tolC was greater when ramA was highly overexpressed through an IPTG - inducible plasmid , which in addition increased expression of genes encoding an additional efflux pump , AcrEF , and the porin gene ompF .
These data suggest an intracellular concentration - dependent response of the bacterium to increasing overexpression of ramA/RamA .
We postulate that such a mechanism is dependent on transcriptional activator concentration and promoter sensitivity , similar to that established previously for E. coli marA , soxS , and rob ( 41 ) .
Our data further suggest that bacterial cells carefully `` orchestrate '' the level of RamA , with too much or none being deleterious to the bacterium .
This is reminiscent of levels of the PhoP/Q system , where expression of these genes and those within its regulon are produced , and at the correct level , only under the appropriate conditions ( 50 ) .
Conversely , inactivation of ramA affected the expression of very few drug efflux pump genes , and ompC , rather than ompF , was decreased .
These data lend further weight to the hypothesis that RamA regulates expression of MDR genes encoding porins and efflux pumps .
Nikaido et al. ( 48 ) showed the presence of a putative rambox in acrAB and tolC .
In this study , we found that ramR also contains a rambox , and our data support previous hypotheses that ramR acts as a local repressor of ramA ( 3 , 57 ) .
We also hypothesize that the absence of functional RamA reduces the expression of ramR in a mechanism aimed to restore wild - type expression of ramA , whereas overexpression of ramA successfully competes with RamR and suppresses further expression of ramR .
The ramR - independent mechanism by which ramA expression is returned to basal levels is unclear .
However , our data support the hypothesis that ramRA works through a mechanism similar to that of marRA within E. coli , with RamA being able to compete with RamR in binding to a hypothetical operator sequence ramO , leading to autoinduction of selfexpression .
Further work is required in order to elucidate the exact composition of any `` ramO '' sequence within ramR , asa significant amount of degeneracy ( 6 base mismatches ) was used to generate the sequence of the rambox used in this study .
Putative ramboxes were also identified within the pathogenicity effector genes sipABC and ssaJ and the AraC/XylS family SPI regulator invF .
This coincided with the decreased expression of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes upon high - level ramA overexpression , while ramA disruption induced SPI - 1 expression .
Previous work with AraC/XylS DNA regulators has suggested that these are transcriptional activators ( 55 , 66 ) , whereas in our study RamA appeared to repress the expression of invF , ssrA and sprA , all additional AraC/XylS family regulators .
The association of an AraC/XylS - family DNA regulator with control of virulence genes has been reported previously for InvF and ToxT ( 34 , 36 ) , but purely as an activator of further genes .
This suggests that the general downregulation of many SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes may not be due to direct interaction with RamA but may be due to the downregulation of invF and ssrA .
The concentration - dependent regulation of the ramA regulon also appeared to extend to genes involved in mediating the pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium , as inactivation of ramR , and therefore lower - level overexpression of ramA , did not significantly affect the expression of SPI genes .
Given that disruption of ramA led to differential pathogenicity gene regulation , we assessed the effect ( s ) upon pathogenicity within various models .
Overexpression of ramA decreased expression of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes , decreased production of SipC , decreased adhesion and survival within RAW 264.7 macrophages , and attenuated pathogenicity within the C. elegans worm model .
These findings suggest that RamA overexpression not only affects expression of efflux pumps but also affects the pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium , via altered SPI gene expression .

SPI - 2 ( 40 ) , was increased upon overexpression of ramA and in opposition to the expression of the pathogenicity island genes it regulates ( 26 ) .
These observations again suggest that some of the transcriptional changes that appear to be RamA dependent may be related to the levels of other regulators .
Furthermore , these data suggest that the intracellular concentration of RamA defines not only the scope of its regulon but also the level of differential expression of targets within it .
Disruption of ramR , leading to modest overexpression of ramA , also decreased expression of pathogenicity genes , though for far fewer genes than seen with plasmid - driven ramA overexpression .
Given the attenuation of L1007 within the C. elegans model , this again supports our hypothesis that ramA/RamA expression influences not only efflux pump gene expression but also pathogenicity .
Less clear is the effect upon pathogenicity after ramA disruption .
As increased expression of a large number of SPI - 1 genes was observed , it was anticipated that increased adhesion to the mouse macrophage would be observed .
However , no effect upon adhesion to macrophages or attenuation within the C. elegans model was observed .
Interestingly , attenuation in the ability to survive both within the macrophage and within the mouse model was seen .
This attenuation may suggest that the decreased expression of only three SPI - 2 genes plays a greater role in defining pathogenicity in these two models than the increased expression of many more genes in SPI - 1 .
This is supported by the lack of attenuation within the C. elegans of the ramA : : aph strain .
Prior work with C. elegans ( 2 ) has shown that salmonella does not cause an intracellular infection , and our data and those of others ( 63 ) suggest that adhesion , rather than intracellular survival , is measured within this model .
This also correlates with recent work in salmonella that demonstrated that SPI - 1 genes are less critical for pathogenicity within the mouse systemic infection model ( 18 ) than SPI - 2 genes .
Inactivation of ramA revealed large changes in expression of ribosomal , glycolytic/gluconeogenic , and amino - acid biosynthetic pathways , whereas overexpression of ramA had little effect on these genes .
This could be due to the increased expression of SPI - 1 genes prompting cellular metabolism to switch to an intracellular - adapted form .
Bowden et al. ( 12 ) showed that glycolysis and glucose transport are important in the infection of mouse macrophages ( 12 ) .
Furthermore , transcriptomic analyses by Eriksson et al. ( 25 ) of S. Typhimurium grown intracellularly within macrophages revealed that the expression of 20 to 30 % of genes in ribosomal and amino - acid biosynthetic pathways was affected by intracellular growth , with an approximately equal split between increased and decreased expression .
Within the subset of amino - acid biosynthetic genes whose expression was altered after intracellular macrophage growth ( 25 ) , cysteine biosynthesis was generally increased .
Within this study , expression of cysteine biosynthetic genes was generally increased after inactivation of ramA , but decreased after inactivation of ramR .
This lends further support to the hypothesis that RamA represses expression of genes contributing to pathogenicity and intracellular survival genes .
Further interrogation of data obtained by Eriksson et al. ( 25 ) revealed that expression of ramA was increased 4 , 8 , and 12 h after macrophage infection between 7.6 - and 24.3 - fold , again suggesting a role for RamA in the control of salmonella pathogenicity .
However , expression of ramR was relatively constant compared to the control , increasing to a maximum of only 1.5 - fold .
In this study , we show that production of AcrAB - TolC and proteins that confer the ability for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to be pathogenic is RamA dependent .
This demonstrates that the regulation of a mechanism of MDR and expression of virulence genes show considerable overlap .
However , we have no evidence to support the hypothesis that increased drug resistance via AcrAB - TolC and RamA production gives rise to a hypervirulent strain .
