STM2209 - STM2208 ( opvAB ) : A Phase Variation Locus of Salmonella enterica Involved in Control of O - Antigen Chain Length Ignacio Cota 1 , Anne Béatrice Blanc - Potard 2 , Josep Casadesús 1 * 1 Departamento de Genética , Facultad de Biología , Universidad de Sevilla , Sevilla , Spain , 2 Unité Mixte de Recherches 5235 , Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et Université Montpellier II , Montpellier , France Abstract STM2209 and STM2208 are contiguous loci annotated as putative protein - coding genes in the chromosome of Salmonella enterica .
Lack of homologs in related Enterobacteria and low G+C content suggest that S. enterica may have acquired STM2209 - STM2208 by horizontal transfer .
STM2209 and STM2208 are co - transcribed from a promoter upstream STM2209 , and their products are inner ( cytoplasmic ) membrane proteins .
Analysis with the bacterial adenylate cyclase two - hybrid system suggests that STM2209 and STM2208 may interact .
Expression of STM2209 - STM2208 is subjected to phase variation in wild type Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium .
Switching frequencies in LB - medium are 6.1610 25 ( OFFRON ) and 3.7610 22 ( ONROFF ) per cell and generation .
Lack of DNA adenine methylation locks STM2209 - STM2208 in the ON state , and lack of the LysR - type factor OxyR locks STM2209 - STM2208 in the OFF state .
OxyR - dependent activation of STM2209 - STM2208 expression is independent of the oxidation state of OxyR .
Salmonella cultures locked in the ON state show alteration of O - antigen length in the lipopolysaccharide , reduced absorption of bacteriophage P22 , impaired resistance to serum , and reduced proliferation in macrophages .
Phenotypic heterogeneity generated by STM2209 - STM2208 phase variation may thus provide defense against phages .
In turn , formation of a subpopulation unable to proliferate in macrophages may restrain Salmonella spread in animal organs , potentially contributing to successful infection .

* E - mail : casadesus@us.es Introduction Phase variation , the reversible switch of gene expression at high frequency ( e. g. , .10 25 per cell and generation ) , is a common phenomenon in bacteria ( reviewed in [ 1,2 ] ) .
Switching turns gene expression from OFF to ON , or from low expression to high expression , and vice versa .
A consequence of phase variation is phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal bacterial populations , a phenomenon of paramount relevance for bacterial survival in harsh environments .
In bacterial pathogens , for instance , phenotypic heterogeneity in cell envelope components may facilitate immune evasion and modulation [ 2,3 ] .
Classical examples of phase variation in pathogenic bacteria involve loci encoding surface - exposed proteins , cell appendixes such as fimbriae , pili , and flagella , and lipopolysaccharide modification functions [ 1,2,4,5 ] .
Phase variation , however , is not restricted to bacterial pathogens nor to loci that encode components of the cell surface [ 6,7 ] .
Bacteria use a variety of mechanisms to produce phase variation [ 1 ] , and a relatively common type of control involves switching between alternative epigenetic states .
Each epigenetic state is propagated by a feedback loop , and reversed after a certain number of generations .
Epigenetic regulation of phase variation systems is often controlled by DNA adenine methylation ( reviewed in [ 8,9 ] ) .
Paradigms of this kind of regulation are the pap operon of uropathogenic E. coli , which encodes fimbriae for attachment to the urinary epithelium [ 10 ] , and the agn43 gene of E. coli , which encodes a non - fimbrial adhesin [ 11 ] .
Other phase variation loci under Dam methylation control are the glycosyltransferase operon ( gtr ) of phage P22 [ 4 ] , the clp operon of enterotoxigenic E. coli [ 12 ] , the pef operon of the Salmonella virulence plasmid [ 13 ] , and perhaps the S. enterica std fimbrial operon [ 14 ] .
This study describes a new phase variation locus in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium .
The locus , annotated as STM2209 - STM2208 in the Salmonella genome database [ 15 ] , is present in Salmonella enterica but not in Salmonella bongori nor in other enteric bacteria .
Aside from the annotation of STM2209 - STM2208 as putative protein - coding genes , the literature contains little information on STM2209 - STM2208 .
An exception is a transcriptome analysis in Dam + and Dam 2 strains of S. enterica which revealed that STM2209 - STM2208 transcripts are more abundant in a Dam 2 background [ 16 ] .
This observation tentatively classified STM2209 - STM2208 as a locus repressed by Dam methylation [ 16 ] .
However , we show that STM2209 - STM2208 is actually a phase variation locus whose expression is locked in the ON state in Dam 2 mutants .
We also show that lack of the LysR - like factor PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e36863 Phase Variation of STM2209 - STM2008 in Salmonella OxyR locks STM2209 - STM2208 expression in the OFF state .
STM2209 and STM2208 are part of a single transcriptional unit , and encode inner membrane proteins .
Constitutive expression of STM2209 - STM2208 alters lipopolysaccharide O chain length , reduces phage P22 adsorption , decreases resistance to serum , and impairs proliferation in macrophages .
Altogether , our observations suggest that phase variation of STM2209 - STM2208 may contribute to phenotypic heterogeneity in Salmonella populations , providing defense against phages and restraining Salmonella spread in animal organs .

Protein extracts and Western blotting analysis Total protein extracts were prepared from bacterial cultures grown at 37uC in LB - medium until stationary - phase ( OD 600 ,3 ) .
Bacterial cells contained in 0.25 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 50 ml of Laemmli sample buffer [ 1.3 % SDS , 10 % ( v/v ) glycerol , 50 mM Tris - HCl , 1.8 % b - mercaptoethanol , 0.02 % bromophenol blue , pH 6.8 ] .
Proteins were resolved by Tris - Glycine - PAGE using 12 % gels ( for STM2208 ) or Tris - Tricine - PAGE 15 % gels ( for STM2209 ) .
Conditions for protein transfer have been described elsewhere [ 14 ] .
Primary antibodies were anti - Flag M2 monoclonal antibody ( 1:5,000 , Sigma - Aldrich ) and anti - GroEL polyclonal antibody ( 1:20,000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) .
Goat anti - mouse horseradish peroxidase - conjugated antibody ( 1:5,000 ; Bio - Rad ) or goat anti - rabbit horseradish peroxidase - conjugated antibody ( 1:20,000 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) was used as secondary antibody .
Proteins recognized by the antibodies were visualized by chemoluminescence using the luciferin -- luminol reagents ( Thermo Scientific ) .
Subcellular fractionation Subcellular fractionation was performed as previously described [ 25 ] , with some modifications .
Briefly , bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37uC and spun down by centrifugation at 15,0006 g for 5 min at 4uC , then resuspended twice in cold phosphatebuffered saline ( PBS , pH 7.4 ) .
The bacterial suspension was either mixed with Laemmli buffer ( total protein extract ) or disrupted by sonication .
Unbroken cells were further removed by low - speed centrifugation ( 5,0006 g , 5 min , 4uC ) .
The supernatant was centrifuged at high speed ( 100,0006 g , 30 min , 4uC ) and the new supernatant was recovered as the cytosol fraction .
The pellet containing envelope material was suspended in PBS with 0.4 % Triton X - 100 and incubated for 2 h at 4uC .
The sample was centrifuged again ( 100,0006 g , 30 min , 4uC ) and divided into the supernatant containing mostly inner membrane proteins and the insoluble fraction corresponding to the outer membrane fraction .
An appropiate volume of Laemmli buffer was added to each fraction .
After heating ( 100uC , 5 min ) and clearing by centrifugation ( 15,0006 g , 5 min , room temperature ) , the samples were analyzed for protein content by SDS - PAGE .
Primer extension The oligonucleotides PE2209 and PE2208 , complementary to internal regions of the genes STM2209 and STM2208 respectively , were end - labeled with [ 32 P ] ATP and annealed to 10 mg of total RNA prepared from S. enterica strains bearing plasmids pIZ1758 ( constructed using oligonucleotides PE5 and PE2209 ) and pIZ1759 ( constructed with PE5 and PE2208 ) .
The end - labeled primer was extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Boehringer Mannheim ) under conditions described previously [ 26 ] .
The products of reverse transcription were analyzed in urea - polyacrylamide gels and visualized using a FLA - 5100 Imaging system ( Fujifilm ) .
Directed construction of point mutations Mutation of the 4 GATC sites contained in the promoter region of STM2209 - STM2208 was achieved using the QuikChangeH Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene ) .
Briefly , a ,1.3 Kb fragment of the STM2209 - STM2208 region containing the 4 GATC sites was cloned into the pGEMT plasmid using the oligonucleotides Clo2208 - 5 and Clo - 2208 - 3 .
Mutations in every GATC were then introduced using oligonucleotides harboring CATC changes ( labeled as DIRnuevo and INVnuevo ) .
The resulting plasmid containing the fragment with 4 CATC sites was then digested with XbaI and SacI , cloned onto the suicide plasmid pDMS197 [ 27 ] and propagated in E. coli CC118 lambda pir .
Plasmids derived from pMDS197 were transformed into E. coli S17 - 1 lambda pir .
The resulting strains were used as donors in matings with S. enterica 14028 harboring a Cm r cassette in place of the 4 GATC sites ( constructed using oligonucleotides delGATC - PS1 and delGATC - PS2 ) as recipients .
Tc r transconjugants were selected on E plates supplemented with - tetracycline .
Several Tc r transconjugants were grown in nutrient broth ( without NaCl ) containing 5 % sucrose .
Individual tetracycline - sensitive segregants were then screened for cloramphenicol sensitivity and examined for the incorporation of the mutant allelle by Sau3AI digestion and DNA sequencing using external oligonucleotides .
Construction of the oxyR C199S mutation was achieved in the same way , using the oligonucleotides ClooxyR - 5 and ClooxyR - 3 for cloning onto pGEMT , and the oligonucleotides oxyRC199SDIR and oxy - RC199SINV for site - directed mutagenesis .
A strain with a Cm r cassette in place of the oxyR gene ( constructed using oligonucleotides deloxyR199 - PS1 and deloxyR199 - PS2 ) was used as a recipient in this case .
Measurement of the efficiency of phage adsorption The efficiency of phage adsorption was calculated as described by Gabig et al. [ 28 ] .
Briefly , P22 bacteriophages were added to S. enterica cells from an LB liquid overnight culture at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 , and the mixture was incubated at 37uC .
Samples were taken every 2 min , centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge , and the supernatant was titrated on the S. enterica wild - type strain ATCC 14028 .
The sample obtained at time zero ( a sample taken immediately after addition of bacteriophages to the cell suspension ) was considered to correspond to 100 % unadsorbed phages , and the remaining numbers were calculated relative to this number .
The Student 's t test was used to determine if the differences in adsorption were statistically significant .
Electrophoretic visualization of lipopolysaccharide profiles To investigate lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) profiles , bacterial cultures were grown overnight in LB .
Bacterial cells were harvested and washed three times with 0.9 % NaCl .
The PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 3 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e36863 Phase Variation of STM2209 - STM2008 in Salmonella O.D. 600 of the washed bacterial suspension was measured to calculate cell concentration .
A bacterial mass containing about 3.14610 8 cells was pelleted by centrifugation .
Treatments applied to the bacterial pellet , electrophoresis of crude bacterial extracts , and silver staining procedures were performed as described by Buendia - Claveria et al. [ 29 ] .
Calculation of phase transition frequencies Phase transition rates were estimated as described by Eisenstein [ 30 ] .
Briefly , a strain harboring an STM2208 : : lac fusion was plated on LB + X - gal and colonies displaying an ON or OFF - phenotype after 16 h growth at 37uC were selected , resuspended in PBS and respread on new plates .
Phase transition frequencies were calculated using the formula ( M/N ) / g where M is the number of cells that underwent a phase transition , N the total number of cells , and g the total number of generations that gave rise to the colony .
Macrophage infection experiments The rate of intramacrophage replication after 18 h infection was performed in J774 mouse macrophages as described in [ 31 ] .
Briefly , macrophages were seeded at a density of 5610 5 in 24 - well plates and grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum at 37uC , 5 % CO2 .
Bacteria were added to the wells at macrophage - to - bacteria ratio of 1:10 .
Phagocytosis was allowed to proceed for 30 min before washing three times with sterile PBS and adding fresh DMEM media supplemented with 20 mg/ml gentamicin .
Macrophages were lysed by using 1 % Triton X - 100 , and the number of viable bacteria that survived the gentamicin treatment was determined by subsequent plating onto LB agar plates .
The replication rate was determined as the ratio between the number of bacteria at time 18 h and the number of internalized bacteria after 30 min phagocytosis .
The Student 's t test was used to determine if the differences in replication rates observed in different backgrounds were statistically significant .
Measurement of survival in serum Survival in guinea pig serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was analyzed as described in [ 32 ] with some modifications .
Briefly , exponential cultures of S. enterica were serially diluted in PBS + 2 mM MgCl 2 to 2610 4 cfu/ml .
Guinea pig serum was added to 30 % final concentration and the mixtures were incubated at 37uC without shaking .
Samples were taken at 30 min intervals by plating on nutrient agar , and viable counts were expressed as a percentage of the initial concentration ( % survival ) .
The Student 's t test was used to determine if the differences in survival to serum observed in different backgrounds were statistically significant .
Bacterial two - hybrid analysis The Bacterial Adenylate Cyclase Two - Hybrid ( BACTH ) system [ 33 ] was used to test interaction between two membrane proteins .
The STM2209 and STM2208 genes were PCR amplified using oligonucleotides pKT25 - STM2209 - PstI - 5 and pKT25 - STM2209 - BamHI - 3 ( STM2209 cloned into pKT25 ) , pUT18C - STM2209 - PstI - 5 and pKT25 - STM2209 - BamHI - 3 ( STM2209 cloned into pUT18C ) , pUT18C - STM2208 - PstI - 5 and pUT18C - STM2208 - BamHI - 3 ( STM2208 cloned into pUT18C ) , pKT25 - STM2208 - PstI - 5 and pUT18C - STM2208 - BamHI - 3 ( STM2208 cloned into pKT25 ) , and cloned onto plasmids pUT18C and pKT25 using the PstI and BamHI sites .
Recombinant plasmids carrying STM2209 and STM2208 were sequenced using oligonucleotides pKT25 - seq5 and pKT25 - seq3 and co - transformed into an E. coli CyaA 2 strain ( BTH101 ) .
Transformants were plated on LB + ampicillin + kanamycin + X - gal medium at 30uC for 30 h. To quantify the interaction between hybrid proteins , bacteria were grown overnight at 30uCinLB + Ap + Km liquid medium supplemented with 0.5 mM isopropyl - ß-D - 1-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) .
ß - galactosidase assays were carried out as described above .
A level of ß - galactosidase activity at least five fold higher than that measured for vectors alone indicates a positive interaction .
Results STM2209 - STM2208 is a Salmonella - specific locus STM2209 and STM2208 are contiguous loci annotated as putative protein - coding genes in the chromosome of Salmonella enterica .
The STM2209 and STM2208 ORFs are conserved in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains ATCC 14028 , SL1344 , and LT2 ( GenBank accession numbers CP001363 .1 , FQ312003 .1 and AE006468 .1 , respectively ) , in the vicinity of the sugar transport gene setB [ 34 ] .
The STM2209 and STM2208 ORFs are also conserved in other Salmonella enterica serovars but not in Salmonella bongori nor in the genera Escherichia and Shigella .
Alignment of the predicted amino - acid sequences of STM2209 and STM2208 using BLASTP [ 35 ] detected no obvious homologs of STM2209 - STM2208 outside Salmonella enterica .
A diagram of the chromosome region in Salmonella enterica and related Enterobacteriaceae is shown in Fig. 1 .
Both STM2209 and STM2208 have low G+C content ( 37 % for STM2209 and 38 % for STM2208 ) compared to both the average of the region ( 53 % ) and that of the Salmonella enterica genome ( 52 % ) [ 36 ] .
Because horizontally acquired genes often have distinctive base composition , specifically low G+C content [ 37,38 ] , these observations suggest that STM2209 - STM2208 may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer .
The organization of the STM2209 and STM2208 ORFs suggests that they may be part of a single transcriptional unit : both coding sequences are on the same DNA strand , and are separated by only one nucleotide .
Genome sequence analysis in silico predicts that STM2209 may encode a small peptide of 40 amino - acids , while STM2208 may be a larger protein product of 221 amino - acids .
In silico analysis of protein structure using the TMHMM transmembrane prediction software [ 39 ] predicts the existence of one transmembrane domain in STM2209 , and two transmembrane domains in STM2208 ( data not shown ) .
In silico analysis also indicates that STM2208 shares a domain with proteins belonging to the Wzz superfamily of O - antigen chain length regulators .
This family includes proteins involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis that confer a modal distribution of chain length on the O - antigen component of lipopolysaccharide [ 40 ] .
This domain is also found in bacterial tyrosine kinases [ 41 ] .
Expression of the STM2209 - STM2208 locus is regulated by Dam methylation A previous study showed that STM2209 and STM2208 are expressed at higher levels ( 13 fold for STM2209 and 8 fold for STM2208 ) inaS .
These observations suggested that expression of the putative STM2209 - STM2208 transcriptional unit might be repressed by Dam methylation .
To confirm Dam - dependent regulation , transcriptional and translational lac fusions were constructed in both loci .
Protein variants tagged with the 3xFLAG epitope were also constructed .
The effect of Dam methylation on STM2209 - STM2208 expression was monitored by ß - galactosidase assays , qRT - PCR , and Western blotting in isogenic Dam + and Dam 2 strains .
Higher level of ß - galactosidase activity , higher amount of retrotranscribed STM2209 - STM2208 mRNA , and increased level of the STM2208 - 3xFLAG product were detected in the Dam 2 back - PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 4 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e36863 Phase Variation of STM2209 - STM2008 in Salmonella Figure 1 .
Diagram of the region containing STM2209 - STM2208 on the Salmonella enterica chromosome .
The homologous regions of Salmonella bongori , E. coli , and Shigella flexneri are also shown .
The STM2209 - STM2208 operon is shown in yellow .
Black arrows represent conserved genes .
White arrows represent non conserved genes .
Grey arrows represent genes found at a different chromosome location on the S. enterica chromosome .
The STM2209 - 3xFLAG product was easily detected in a Dam 2 background but was hardly visible in the Dam + background , presumably due the combined effects of its low level of expression and its small size .
STM2209 - 3xFLAG visualization by Western blotting in a Dam + background was however possible upon longer gel exposure ( data not shown ) .
Although the extent of derepression differed slightly depending on the method , expression of STM2209 - STM2208 was significantly higher in a Dam 2 background in all experiments .
These results confirm that Dam methylation represses STM2209 - STM2208 .
Furthermore , our ability to detect Dam - dependent regulation with both transcriptional lac fusions and qRT - PCR suggests that Damdependent regulation of STM2209 - STM2208 may be transcriptional .
Characterization of the STM2209 - STM2208 transcriptional unit To characterize the STM2209 - STM2208 transcriptional unit , we mapped the 59 terminus of the putative STM2209 - STM2208 transcript using primer - extension ( Fig. 3 ) .
Because STM2208 and STM2209 are expressed at low levels in Dam + S. enterica [ 16 ] , a DNA fragment containing the region upstream STM2209 - STM2208 and part of the coding sequence of STM2209 - STM2208 was cloned on the pGEMT multicopy vector to obtain higher amounts of transcript ( s ) .
The resulting plasmids ( pIZ1758 and pIZ1759 ) were introduced in the wild type strain , and two primer - extension reactions were performed .
One reaction was primed by an oligonucleotide complementary to STM2209 ( PE2209 ) , and the second reaction by an oligonucleotide complementary to STM2208 ( PE2208 ) .
Both reactions yielded extension products with identical 39 ends ( Fig. 3 ) , indicating the existence of a single transcription initiation site , six nucleotides upstream the start codon of STM2209 proposed in the XBASE ( http://www.xbase.ac.uk/ ) and NCBI ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih .
A DNA sequence reminiscent of a canonical ribosome - binding site is however missing in this putative mRNA organization .
For this reason , we propose that translation of STM2209 may be actually initiated at position +25 , 10 nucleotides downstream a putative ribosome binding site ( 59 TGTGG 39 ) .
This hypothesis is supported by additional evidence : a translational lac fusion constructed upstream +25 proved to be non functional : ß - galactosidase activity was not detected in a Dam 2 background ( data not shown ) .
Altogether , these observations may indicate that STM2209 consists of 34 amino - acids and not 40 amino - acids as described in the Salmonella enterica ATCC 14028 genome annotation .
In silico analysis of the DNA sequence upstream of the +1 site identified DNA sequences with features similar to those of canonical , sigma - 70 - dependent promoters [ 42 ] : ( i ) a putative 210 module including the motif 59 TAAAAT 39 , which shows 5/6 matches with the consensus sequence [ 42 ] ; ( ii ) a putative spacer , 17 nucleotides long ; and ( iii ) a 59 GTGAAT 39 sequence defining a putative 235 module , with 3/6 matches with the consensus sequence [ 42 ] .
We propose that STM2209 and STM2208 are cotranscribed from this promoter , an hypothesis consistent with the observation that the STM2209 and STM2208 products are coexpressed ( Fig. 2 ) .
Identification of OxyR as a regulator of STM2209 - STM2208 A genetic screen based on the T - POP3 transposon [ 43 ] was used to search for positive regulators of STM2209 - STM2208 .
For this purpose , a Dam 2 strain carrying a lac translational fusion in STM2208 ( SV5683 ) was used .
This strain forms deep blue colonies on LB supplemented with X - gal .
Isolates carrying T - POP3 insertions were selected on LB + tetracycline + kanamycin + X - gal , and white colonies were sought .
Only a small white colony was obtained in the screen .
Cloning and sequencing of T - POP3 boundaries indicated that T - POP3 had inserted in the oxyR gene .
OxyR 2 mutants are severely impaired to form colonies on LB plates [ 44 ] , thus explaining the small colony size of the isolate .
However , the isolate formed large colonies on LB + catalase , a standard procedure that permits colony formation by OxyR 2 mutants [ 44 ] .
To confirm that oxyR loss - of - function abolished STM2209 - STM2208 expression in a Dam 2 background , the oxyR gene was disrupted using lambda Red recombineering .
The resulting strain ( SV5925 ) , which carries a null oxyR allele , was used in further experiments .

g002 Analyses of ß - galactosidase activity and Western blotting showed that expression of STM2209 - STM2208 is virtually abolished in an OxyR 2 background ( Fig. 4 ) .
As above ( Fig. 2 ) , high levels of ß - galactosidase and of the STM2209 - 3xFLAG and STM2208 - 3xFLAG products were detected in the Dam 2 background only .
These experiments indicate that OxyR is essential for the expression of STM2209 - STM2208 .
Interestingly , putative OxyR binding sites are found in the promoter region of STM2209 - STM2208 ( see below ) .
OxyR is a global transcription factor that can sense oxidative stress by direct oxidation .
In the oxidized state , OxyR activates the expression of oxidative - stress - responding genes [ 45 ] .
However , OxyR also acts as a transcriptional regulator irrespective of its oxidative state .
In the absence of oxidative - stress , OxyR remains mostly in the reduced form due to the reducing environment of the cell [ 46 ] .
Several observations suggested that the oxidative state of OxyR is not relevant for STM2209 - STM2208 regulation .
One was that an H 2 O 2 concentration sufficient to promote the expression of genes belonging to the classical OxyR regulon ( genes activated by oxidative damage ) showed no effect on the expression of STM2209 - STM2208 ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , the spacing between the half sites in the putative OxyR binding sites described below is consistent with specific binding of the reduced form of OxyR [ 47 ] .
To determine the effect of oxidation of OxyR upon STM2209 - STM2208 expression , we constructed a point mutant version of the oxyR gene ( strain SV6397 ) .
The resulting OxyR C199S protein is locked in the reduced form as it can not form the disulfide bond required for oxidation [ 46,47 ] .
Dam + and Dam 2 strains harboring this mutation showed levels of STM2209 - STM2208 expression similar to those described above for strains carrying the wild type oxyR allele ( data not shown ) .
These observations suggest that oxidation of OxyR is not necessary for STM2209 - STM2208 expression .
STM2209 - STM2208 expression undergoes phase variation under the control of Dam methylation and OxyR In the course of our experiments with strains carrying STM2209 : : lac or STM2208 : : lac fusions in a wild type background , we detected phenotypic heterogeneity when culture aliquots were spread on plates containing X - gal .
These strains formed white colonies that later turned pale blue , indicating low expression of STM2209 and STM2208 .
However , deep blue colonies were also PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 6 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e36863 Phase Variation of STM2209 - STM2008 in Salmonella Figure 4 .

g003 seen , especially on plates that contained high numbers of colonies ( e. g. , $ 1,000 colonies ) .
Whenever a blue colony was isolated and streaked out for single colonies , a mixture of white and blue colonies was obtained .
This observation suggested that STM2209 - STM2208 expression might undergo phase variation , and that switching from OFF to ON might occur at lower frequencies than switching from ON to OFF .
Phase variation frequencies in the STM2209 - STM2208 locus were calculated using the formula ( M/N ) / g where M is the number of cells that underwent a phase transition , N the total number of cells , and g the total number of generations that gave rise to the colony [ 30 ] .
An STM2208 : : lac translational fusion was used for these experiments .
The frequency of OFFRON transition was estimated to be 6.161.7610 25 per cell and generation .
The ONROFF switching rate was around 1,000 - fold higher : 3.760.1610 22 per cell and generation .
Phase variation of STM2209 - STM2208 expression was also unaffected by the oxidation state of OxyR ( data not shown ) .
Phase variation was abolished in both Dam 2 and OxyR 2 mutants ( Fig. 5 ) .
Lack of Dam methylation locks STM2209 - STM2208 expression in the ON state , and lack of OxyR locks STM2209 - STM2208 expression in the OFF state .
An oxyR mutation is epistatic over a dam mutation , an observation that may indicate that activation of STM2209 - STM2208 transcription by OxyR is Dam - methylation sensitive .
However , both Dam methylation and OxyR are needed to establish phase - variable expression of STM2209 - STM2208 .
Site - directed mutagenesis of GATC sites upstream the STM2209 - STM2208 promoter abolishes phase variation In silico analysis of the DNA sequence upstream the STM2209 - STM2208 promoter revealed the existence of 4 GATC sites arranged in a symmetrical pattern ( Fig. 6 ) .
In addition , the region contains two putative OxyR binding sites very similar to the consensus sequence [ 46 ] .
These sites overlap with GATC sites number 2 and 4 respectively ( Fig. 6 ) .
Because of the pleiotropy of dam mutations , alteration of gene expression in Dam 2 mutants does not necessarily indicate direct Dam - dependent control [ 48 ] .
To confirm that Dam methylation directly controls STM2209 - STM2208 expression , the GATC sites present in the promoter region of STM2209 - STM2208 were eliminated by site - directed mutagenesis .
If STM2209 - STM2208 repression by Dam methylation depends directly on methylation of the GATC sites within the STM2209 - STM2208 UAS , we reasoned , elimination of the GATCs should lock STM2209 - STM2208 expression in the ON state .
To test this prediction , point mutations were engineered to transform the STM2209 - STM2208 59GATC39 sequences to 59CATC39 sequences , which are not a substrate for Dam methylase activity ( strain SV6401 ) .
Furthermore , the four base pair substitutions introduced in the STM2209 - STM2208 UAS do not destroy known critical regions of the OxyR binding sequence [ 47 ] .
ß - galactosidase activity assays and Western blotting analysis proved that regulation by Dam methylation was abolished when the GATC sites were eliminated ( Fig. 6 ) .
Expression of STM2209 - STM2208 was $ 2 fold higher in the GATC - less mutant ( SV7031 ) than the Dam 2 mutant ( SV5683 ) ( Fig. 6 ) , but STM2209 - PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 7 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e36863 Phase Variation of STM2209 - STM2008 in Salmonella Figure 5 .

Construction of strain SV6401 thus permitted to analyze the consequences of STM2209 - STM2208 constitutive expression avoiding the pleiotropic effects of dam mutations ( see below ) .
The STM2209 and STM2208 gene products are proteins located in the inner ( cytoplasmic ) membrane of Salmonella enterica The subcellular location of STM2209 and STM2208 was investigated using 3xFLAG - tagged variants .
Electrophoretic separation of cell fractions ( cytosol , cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane ) was performed , and Western analysis of the separated protein preparations was carried out with a commercial anti- FLAG antibody .
The results unambiguously showed that STM2209 and STM2208 are located in the S. enterica inner ( cytoplasmic ) membrane ( Fig. 7 ) .
Evidence for interaction between STM2209 and STM2208 in the Salmonella cytoplasmic membrane STM2209 may represent a novel example of a membrane peptide , an emerging class of functional molecules [ 49 ] .
Because certain membrane peptides have been shown to interact with membrane protein partners , we investigated whether STM2209 interacts with the inner - membrane protein STM2208 .
To test interaction between STM2209 and STM2208 in - vivo , we used the Bacterial Adenylate Cyclase Two - Hybrid ( BACTH ) assay , a procedure that permits the detection of specific interactions between inner membrane proteins [ 50 ] .
STM2209 and STM2208 were independently cloned on plasmids pUT18C and pKT25 .
Four plasmid constructs were obtained ( pUT18C - STM2209 , pKT25 - STM2209 , pUT18C - STM2208 , and pKT25 - STM2208 ) , and their interaction was tested in an E. coli CyaA 2 mutant ( BTH101 ) .
Functional complementation was determined by measuring ß - galactosidase activity .
High levels of ß - galactosidase activity were obtained with both plasmid pairs , compared with the basal activities of the plasmid vectors or with the activity of one fusion protein only ( Fig. 8 ) .
These results suggest that STM2209 and STM2208 may interact indeed .
Constitutive expression of STM2209 - STM2208 reduces P22 adsorption to S. enterica During strain construction experiments by P22 HT transduction , we obtained reduced numbers of transductants whenever the strain that constitutively expresses STM2209 - STM2208 ( SV6401 ) was used as a recipient .
This observation , combined with the fact that STM2209 and STM2208 are components of the cell envelope , raised the possibility that constitutive synthesis of STM2209 and STM2208 might impair adsorption of bacteriophage P22 .
To test this hypothesis , we compared the kinetics of P22 adsorption to the wild type strain , to a strain that constitutively expresses STM2209 - STM2208 ( SV6401 ) , and to a strain that harbors a deletion of STM2209 - STM2208 ( SV6013 ) .
Suspensions of P22 bacteriophage and S. enterica were mixed , and samples were taken every two minutes , and centrifuged .
The supernatant was subsequently titrated to monitor the presence of unattached phages ( Fig. 9 ) .
Adsorption of P22 to S. enterica cells was found to be severely impaired in the strain that constitutively expressed STM2209 - STM2208 ( SV6401 ) , which proved to be largely refractory to phage P22 attachment .
In contrast , P22 adsorption remained unaltered in a strain carrying a STM2209 - STM2208 deletion ( SV6013 ) regardless of the presence of the mutated GATCs ( SV6976 ) .
These experiments suggest that phase variation of STM2209 - STM2208 may split clonal populations of S. enterica into two subpopulations , one of which is P22 - sensitive while the other is P22 - resistant .
Constitutive expression of STM2209 - STM2208 alters chain length distribution in the lipopolysaccharide O - antigen of S. enterica Because phage P22 is known to attatch to the LPS of Salmonella enterica to initiate infection [ 51 ] , we examined whether the strain that constitutively expresses STM2209 - STM2208 ( SV6401 ) showed LPS alterations .

Survival in serum was analyzed by treating exponentially growing cells with 30 % nonimmune guinea pig serum .
Constitutive expression of STM2209 - STM2208 caused increased killing by serum ( Fig. 11 ) .
This is likely to be complement - mediated , since heat - inactivated serum did not impair growth of strain SV6401 ( data not shown ) .

g006 gel is known to be affected by the number and size of repeating oligosaccharide units in long - chain LPS , such that bands in the profile represent progressively larger concatemers of the repeating oligosaccharide units [ 52 ] .
Comparison of the LPS profiles in strain SV6401 and the wild type revealed drastic alterations in the length of O - antigen chains ( Fig. 10 ) .
Wild type Salmonella LPS shows a bimodal distribution typical of many Enterobacteriaceae , with higher amounts of bands with 16 -- 35 and .100 repeats [ 40,53 -- 55 ] .
Strain SV6401 showed a unimodal distribution , with bands concentrated in the 3 -- 8 repeat range .
This short and homogeneous LPS might well explain reduced phage P22 attachment .
No alteration of the LPS profile was detected in a strain carrying a STM2209 - STM2208 deletion ( SV6013 ) , in agreement with its ability to permit a normal level of P22 adsorption ( Fig. 9 ) .
The main conclusion from these experiments Constitutive expression of STM2209 - STM2208 reduces S. enterica proliferation in macrophages Additional screens and phenotypic assays were performed in search for functions of STM2209 - STM2208 phase variation besides the formation of a P22 - resistant subpopulation with reduced resistance to serum .
The trials included : ( i ) growth in various media at different temperatures and different osmolarities ; ( ii ) resistance to acidic pH , cationic peptides , bile , and hydrogen peroxide ; ( iii ) motility ; ( iv ) biofilm formation ; ( v ) and invasion of and proliferation in epithelial and macrophage cell lines .
Most trials did not show differences associated either to loss or constitutive expression of STM2209 - STM2208 .
A remarkable exception was that constitutive expression of STM2209 - STM2208 impaired intracellular proliferation within macrophages ( Fig. 12 ) .
On the other hand , a strain carrying a STM2209 - STM2208 deletion showed intramacrophage proliferation at a level similar level to that of the wild - type strain .
These observations suggest that repression of STM2209 - STM2208 expression may be required to permit Salmonella proliferation within macrophages .
However , a nonproliferating S. enterica population may be also generated by switching STM2209 - STM2208 to the ON state .
Discussion STM2209 and STM2208 , hitherto annotated as putative genes of unknown function in the genome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , are absent in Salmonella bongori and in other species of enteric bacteria ( Fig. 1 ) .
This assortment , combined with G+C content lower than the core Salmonella genome ( 38 % vs. 52 % , approximately ) , suggests acquisition by horizontal transfer .
STM2209 and STM2208 are part of a single transcriptional unit , and are transcribed from a promoter upstream STM2209 ( Fig. 3 ) .
The STM2209 gene product is a small hydrophobic peptide ( putatively , 34 amino - acids ) while STM2208 encodes a larger hydrophobic protein ( putatively , 221 amino - acids ) .

For instance , the putative transmembrane domain of STM2209 and the putative N - terminus - proximal transmembrane domain of STM2208 are rich in phenylalanine and share additional amino acid sequence features .
STM2209 and STM2208 , however , lack common packing motifs described elsewhere for transmembranehelix interactions , such as GxxxG , Ala - coil or motifs of serine and threonine [ 60 -- 62 ] .

g012 larger proteins encoded in the same transcriptional unit , modulating their activity or stability [ 49 ] .
This study presents evidence that STM2209 and STM2208 interact indeed ( Fig. 8 ) .
The functional significance of STM2209 - STM2208 interaction remains unknown ; a tentative analogy with other peptide - protein pairs [ 49,63 ] permits the speculation that the STM2209 peptide might modulate the function of the STM2208 protein or act as a subunit in a larger complex .
Expression of the STM2209 - STM2208 locus is subjected to phase variation ( Fig. 5 ) , and the OFFRON switching frequency in LB - medium is 3 orders of magnitude lower than ONROFF switching ( 6.1610 25 vs. 3.7610 22 per cell and generation ) .
Skewed frequencies of switching are also found in other phase variation loci : for instance , in the E. coli pap operon , the OFFRON switching frequency is 5.54610 24 per cell and generation , while the ONROFF switching frequency is 2.34610 22 per cell and generation [ 64 ] .
Hence , like in pap , the subpopulation of cells that express STM2209 - STM2208 in LB is smaller than the population of cells that do not express STM2209 - STM2208 .
However , the switching frequencies detected under laboratory conditions can be different from those occurring in natural environments [ 8,65 ] .
In the pap operon , for instance , the switching frequencies are skewed by environmental inputs involving global regulators like Crp and H - NS and the stress - responsive system CpxRA [ 66 -- 68 ] .
Lack of Dam methylation locks STM2209 - STM2208 in the ON state ( Fig. 5 ) , thus explaining why STM2209 - STM2208 was initially considered a locus repressed by Dam methylation [ 16 ] .
Dam methylation has been previously shown to control phase variation systems along with a variety of transcriptional regulators [ 8 ] .
However , Dam methylation can also regulate gene expression indirectly , either as a consequence of lack of DNA mismatch repair or by controlling expression of postranscriptional regulators [ 48,69 ] .
In the case of STM2209 - STM2208 , the observation that site - directed mutagenesis of GATC sites located upstream the STM2209 - STM2208 promoter locks expression in the ON state ( Fig. 6 ) provides preliminary evidence that Dam methylation may regulate STM2209 - STM2208 transcription .
Evidence that STM2209 - STM2208 is a new locus under the control of a Damsensitive transcriptional regulator is further supported by the identification of the LysR - like factor OxyR as a positive regulator of STM2209 - STM2208 expression ( Fig. 4 ) .
OxyR is a well known transcriptional regulator [ 45 ] , and has been previously shown to control phase variation of other Dam methylation - sensitive loci : the E. coli agn43 gene [ 70,71 ] and the P22 gtr operon [ 4 ] .
Unlike agn43 , which is repressed by OxyR [ 70 ] , and gtr , which is both activated and repressed by OxyR [ 4 ] , STM2209 - STM2208 is under positive control by OxyR ( Fig. 4 ) .
Like in agn43 and in gtr , however , the oxidation state of OxyR is irrelevant for control of STM2209 - STM2208 expression .
When STM2209 - STM2208 expression is locked in the ON state , Salmonella cells become resistant to phage P22 ( Fig. 9 ) , presumably by alteration of O - antigen chain length in the lipopolysaccharide ( Fig. 10 ) .
Hence , phase variation of STM2209 - STM2208 expression in wild type populations of Salmonella can be expected to generate a subpopulation of P22 - resistant cells .
Resistance might be potentially extended to other Salmonella - specific lambdoid bacteriophages [ 72 ] .
Phase variation in mechanisms of defense against bacteriophage infection has been previously described [ 6 ] .
A phase variation system that controls Salmonella lipopolysaccharide modification has been also described in phage P22 [ 4 ] .
However , to our knowledge , STM2209 - STM2208 may be the first example of a phase variation system that confers phage resistance through alteration of O - antigen chain length .
O - antigen alteration may be also the cause of two infectionrelated traits associated to STM2209 - STM2208 expression .
One is increased sensitivity to serum ( Fig. 11 ) , which may be explained by the involvement of O - antigen chain length in serum resistance [ 32,54,56,58 ] .
Reduced capacity to proliferate in macrophages ( Fig. 12 ) could also be attributed to modification of the structure of LPS [ 73,74 ] , although the relevance of O - antigen chain length in the Salmonella - macrophage interaction has been questioned [ 75,76 ] .
On the other hand , LPS - containing outer membrane vesicles have been shown to mediate delivery of Salmonella virulence effectors to macrophages [ 77 ] , suggesting that constitutive synthesis of STM2209 and STM2208 might impair the secretion process .
Current evidence suggests that diversity in the structure and distribution of O - antigen length permits a balance between resistance to antimicrobial compounds and the ability to interact with different cell types [ 75 ] .
Indeed , it has been described that O - antigen length is reduced upon growth inside murine PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 11 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e36863 Phase Variation of STM2209 - STM2008 in Salmonella macrophages [ 78 ] in a way reminiscent of the effect of constitutive expression of STM2209 - STM2208 ( Fig. 10 ) .
Interestingly , expression of STM2209 - STM2208 is upregulated inside epithelial cells and macrophages [ 79 ] .
STM2208 displays features typical of Gram - negative O - antigen chain length regulators such as Wzz ST ( 16 -- 35 repeats ) and Wzz fepE ( .100 repeats ) : a common protein structure consisting of two transmembrane domains and a hydrophilic periplasmic domain , relative richness in proline residues in the second transmembrane segment [ 80 ] , and a particular set of conserved amino - acid - residues near the N - terminal end [ 81 ] .
STM2208 lacks , however , a predicted coiled - coil periplasmic domain typical of many O - antigen chain length regulators [ 80 ] .
However , other O - antigen chain length regulators show little or no potential for coiled - coil formation .
Furthermore , there is a correlation between coiled - coil potential of the periplasmic domain and the modal length conferred on the LPS O - antigen chains [ 80 ] .
Because constitutive expression of STM2209 - STM2208 leads to short modal length of the O - antigen ( Fig. 10 ) , lack of coiled - coil potential is not surprising .
Formation of a phage - resistant subpopulation upon STM2209 - STM2208 phase variation may have obvious selective value .
In contrast , the potential advantage of forming a less virulent bacterial subpopulation may be at the first sight intriguing .
However , subpopulation formation has been described at several stages of host colonization by Salmonella , and a tentative interpretation is that reduction or arrest of bacterial growth is part of a stealthy strategy that increases the chances of successful infection .
For instance , bistability in the synthesis of flagellin helps Salmonella to evade the host caspase - 1 inflammatory response [ 3 ] .
Another example is found upon Salmonella entry into macrophages : the population splits into two subpopulations , one of which replicates while the other enters a dormant - like state [ 82 ] .
It has also been suggested that a successful infection strategy might involve the sacrifice of a fraction of the total population [ 83 ] .

might be argued that the rate of STM2209 - STM2208 switching to the ON state ( approximately , 6610 25 per cell and generation ) may be too low to produce a bacterial subpopulation of relevant size in animal tissues , especially in macrophages which typically host very low numbers of Salmonella cells [ 84 ] .
However , as discussed above , the switching rates observed in the laboratory may not apply to other growth - conditions [ 1 ] .
Actually , the introduction of deterministic elements in stochastic gene regulation may be a common feature of phase variation systems [ 65 ] .
Phase variation of STM2209 - STM2208 might thus occur at different rates in different environments .
Formation of a phage - resistant subpopulation , however , can be expected to have selective value regardless of the subpopulation size .
We propose that the STM2209 - STM2208 locus is renamed opv ( for O - antigen phase variation ) so that the STM2209 gene is henceforth known as opvA , and the STM2208 gene as opvB .
