These genes encode systems related to motility , adhesion , invasion , and intestinal persistence .
Key among them is a type three secretion system ( T3SS ) encoded within Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) .
In addition to the SPI1 T3SS , other systems , including flagella and type 1 fimbriae , have been implicated in Salmonella pathogenesis .
In this study , we investigated the dynamic expression of the flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial genes .
We demonstrate that these genes are expressed in a temporal hierarchy , beginning with the flagellar genes , followed by the SPI1 genes , and ending with the type 1 fimbrial genes .
This hierarchy could mirror the roles of these three systems during the infection cycle .
As multiple studies have shown that extensive regulatory cross talk exists between these three systems , we also tested how removing different regulatory links between them affects gene expression dynamics .
These results indicate that cross talk is critical for regulating gene expression during transitional phases in the gene expression hierarchy .
In addition , we identified a novel regulatory link between flagellar and type 1 fimbrial gene expression dynamics , where we found that the flagellar regulator , FliZ , represses type 1 fimbrial gene expression through the posttranscriptional regulation of FimZ .
The significance of these results is that they provide the first systematic study of the effect of regulatory cross talk on the expression dynamics of flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial genes .
Salmonella enterica causes a large number of diseases ranging from self - limiting gastroenteritis to life - threatening systemic infection ( 21 , 62 ) .
Previous studies have identified multiple factors involved in Salmonella pathogenesis , including those related to motility , adhesion , invasion , and intestinal persistence ( 12 , 18 , 39 , 43 , 45 , 55 , 66 , 83 , 86 -- 88 ) .
Key among them is a type 3 secretion system ( T3SS ) encoded within a 40 - kb region of the chromosome called Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) ( 46 -- 48 , 51 , 63 , 76 ) .
The SPI1 T3SS functions as a molecular hypodermic needle , enabling Salmonella to inject proteins into host cells ( 11 -- 13 ) .
These injected proteins both commandeer the actin cytoskeleton to facilitate the invasion of host cells and induce inflammatory diarrhea ( 27 , 29 , 33 , 52 , 59 , 92 ) .
In addition to the SPI1 T3SS , other systems , including flagella and type 1 fimbriae , have been implicated in Salmonella pathogenesis ( 31 , 36 , 75 ) .
Briefly , flagella are long helical filaments attached to rotary motors embedded within the membrane that enable the bacterium to swim in liquids and swarm over surfaces ( 9 ) .
Flagella are thought to facilitate invasion by enabling Salmonella to swim to sites of invasion ( 39 , 75 ) .
In addition to motility , flagellin activates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines ( 26 , 60 , 61 , 77 , 84 ) .

the other hand , are hairlike appendages that carry adhesins specific for mannosylated glycoproteins on eukaryotic cell surfaces ( 2 , 25 , 54 , 78 ) .
They are thought to be involved in pathogenesis by facilitating binding to intestinal epithelial cells ( 4 , 24 , 35 , 40 , 78 ) .
As with flagella , type 1 fimbriae do not appear to play a direct role in intestinal invasion but rather are thought to contribute to intestinal colonization and persistent infections ( 1 , 19 ) .
Multiple studies have shown that extensive regulatory cross talk exists between these three systems ( 5 , 10 , 22 , 38 , 53 , 58 , 72 , 79 ) .
While the molecular details have been studied extensively ( Fig. 1 ) , the role and significance of these cross talk interactions are still relatively unknown .
As all three systems play unique and potentially mutually exclusive roles during the infection cycle , we hypothesized that regulatory cross talk controls their dynamic expression .
In particular , regulatory cross talk controls the timing of induction and the duration of gene expression for these three systems .
To test the hypothesis , we monitored SPI1 , flagellar , and type 1 fimbrial gene expression dynamics in a number of mutants where different regulatory links between these three systems had been selectively removed .
Based on these results , we demonstrate that there is a natural hierarchy in the expression dynamics of the three , beginning with flagella , followed by the SPI1 T3SS , and ending with type 1 fimbriae .
Our results also indicate that the regulatory cross talk between the three systems serves to tune the timing of gene expression with regard to their temporal activation and deactivation .

Coordinate regulation of the flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial genes .
The master regulator for flagellar gene expression is FlhD 4 C 2 ( 9 ) .
The FlhD 4 C 2 complex , in turn , activates two additional regulators , FliA and FliZ , encoded within the fliAZ operon .
FliA is a flagellum - specific alternate sigma factor essential for the expression of the motor , filament , and chemotaxis genes .
FliZ is a posttranslational activator of FlhD 4 C 2 ( 71 ) .
FliZ also activates HilD ( 38 , 41 , 53 , 57 , 82 ) and represses FimZ posttranscriptionally ( this study ) .
In the SPI1 T3SS , HilD , HilC , and RtsA form three interlocking positive - feedback loops where all three activate each other 's and their own expression ( 23 ) .
In addition , they can independently activate HilA expression .
HilA is required for the expression of the genes encoding the SPI1 T3SS .
SPI1 gene expression is negatively regulated by HilE , which binds to HilD and prevents it from activating the SPI1 promoters .
RtsB , encoded within the same operon as RtsA , binds to the P flhDC promoter and represses motility ( 22 ) .
In type 1 fimbriae , FimW and FimZ form a coupled feedback loop where they can activate their own and each other 's expression ( 72 ) .
They can also independently activate the expression of the P fimA promoter , which controls the expression of genes encoding type 1 fimbriae .
FimY and FimW also participate in a negative - feedback loop , where FimY activates FimW expression and FimW represses FimY expression .
FimZ also binds to the P flhDC promoter and represses the expression of the flagellar genes ( 10 ) and induces the expression of HilE to repress SPI1 gene expression ( 5 , 72 ) .

The S. enterica serovar Typhimurium generalized transducing phage P22 HT105/1 int - 201 was used in all transductional crosses ( 15 ) .
Chromosomal mutations were introduced using standard Red recombination in cells carrying the helper plasmid pKD46 as described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 14 ) .

removed by passing pCP20 through strain CR800 , resulting in strain CR801 ( rtsB : : FRT ) .
Strain CR803 ( fimZ : : FRT fliZ : : FRT ) was constructed by transducing the antibiotic resistance marker from CR312 to CR201 using P22 transduction ( resulting in strain CR802 ) and then removing the resistance marker using pCP20 .
Strain CR804 ( P fimZ : : tetRA ) was constructed by replacing the native P fimZ promoter with a tetRA element from transposon Tn10 .
The tetRA element was amplified using primers SS178F ( CCA TTA AAT GTA AAT ATT TCA CAT AAA ATT AAT ATT TAC AAG AGT AGG GAA CTG CCA ) and SS178R ( CTG TTA TGC GTC CTT CGT TTT ATA ATA AGC GTC AGA CAC CCT AAG CAC TTG TCT CCT ) , with TH8094 as the template ( 44 ) .

Strains CR805 ( P fimZ : : tetRA fimY : : FRT ) and CR806 ( P fimZ : : tetRA fimYZ : : FRT ) were constructed by transducing the tetRA element from CR804 into strains CR322 and CR334 , respectively .
Strain CR808 ( rtsB : : FRT fliZ : : FRT ) was made by first transducing the chloramphenicol resistance marker from strain CR800 ( rtsB : : Cm ) to CR201 ( fliZ : : FRT ) and then removing the antibiotic resistance marker from the resulting strain , CR807 ( rtsB : : Cm fliZ : : FRT ) .

Transcriptional fusions of the promoters of interest were made in the following manner .
The P hilA promoter was amplified using primers PhilAF ( GGG GGA TCC ACT TGT CAT CGC TAT GAT GA ) and PhilAR ( GGG GAA TTC ACA GGA TTA AAA TGT GGC AT ) .
The P fimA promoter was amplified using primers SS104F ( TTT GGT ACC AAA TCT GTG AGG CCG GAT TG ) and SS104R ( GGG GAA TTC GTA GAG GTC ATT AAT TTA TG ) .
The PCR fragments from both were digested with KpnI and EcoRI ( underlined sequences ) and cloned into the multiple - cloning site of plasmid pSS009 .
The resulting plasmids were called pSS077 and pSS222 , respectively .
Expression vectors for RtsB and FimZ were constructed by PCR amplifying the gene of interest and cloning it in the multiple - cloning site of the vector , pPROTet.E .
The resulting arrangement put the gene under a constitutively active P LtetO - 1 promoter .
The rtsB gene was amplified using primers SS198F ( GGC GAA TTC TTA TAA GGA GGA AAA ACA TTT GAG ATA TCT GAC AAT GCA ) and SS198R ( TTT GGT ACC TTA CGT AAT ATC GAC TGA TA ) .
The fimZ gene was amplified using primers SS106F ( GGG GAA TTC TAA CAG TCT GAG GCA TAC AA ) and SS106R ( TTT GGT ACC TTA CAA TAA TTC GTG TGA TT ) .
The resulting plasmids were called pRtsB and pFimZ , respectively .
Prior to transformations in wild - type and mutant strains , all constructs were verified by sequencing .
Fluorescence and luminescence assays .
Endpoint fluorescent measurements and dynamic luminescence measurements were made using a Tecan Safire2 microplate reader .
For fluorescence endpoint measurements for type 1 fimbrial gene expression ( P fimA promoter activity ) , a 1 - ml culture was grown at 37 °C overnight and then subcultured 1:1,000 in fresh medium and grown under static conditions for 24 h at 37 °C .
One hundred microliters was then transferred to a 96 - well microplate , and the relative fluorescence and optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) were measured .
The fluorescence readings , given as relative fluorescence units ( RFU ) , were normalized with the OD 600 to account for cell density .
All endpoint experiments were done on three different days , with six repeats on each day .
The average values and the standard deviations of the data are reported .
Statistical analysis was performed using Student 's t test , where the reported P values are based on the average fluorescence value for each separate day .
Dynamic luminescence experiments were performed as follows .
Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB without salt and with vigorous shaking .
The overnight culture was then subcultured 1:500 in fresh LB - medium ( with 1 % salt ) .
A 100 - l aliquot of the subcultured cells was then transferred to a 96 - well plate and covered with a Breathe - Easy membrane to prevent evaporation .
Luminescence and optical density readings were then taken every 20 min .
All experiments were done in three independent repeats , with six samples in each experiment .
The average values and the standard deviations of the data at each time point are reported .
RESULTS Flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial genes are expressed in a temporal hierarchy .
Our governing hypothesis is that regulatory cross talk controls the dynamic expression of flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial genes .
As a first step toward testing this hypothesis , we measured gene expression dynamics for the three systems in wild - type cells .
In these experiments , we first grew the cells overnight in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium without salt and then subcultured them into fresh LB - 1 % NaCl medium in the absence of shaking , thus inducing a transition from SPI1 - repressing to SPI1 - inducing conditions .
Growth under low - oxygen and high - salt conditions has previously been shown to induce SPI1 gene expression in - vitro ( 3 , 51 ) .
To measure gene expression dynamics , we employed plasmid - based transcriptional fusions of the P flgA , P hilA , and P fimA promoters to the luciferase operon luxCDABE from Photorhabdus luminescens ( 71 , 89 ) .
The P flgA promoter controls the expression of the genes encoding the structural components of the flagellar P - ring protein ( 65 ) and thus provides a proxy measure for flagellar gene expression .
The P hilA promoter controls the expression of HilA , the master regulator for the genes encoding FIG. 2 .

For reference purposes , the optical density ( OD600 ) was plotted to illustrate how each system is activated during different phases of growth .
In these experiments , cells were first grown overnight at 37 °C in LB without salt and then subcultured 1:500 in fresh LB - 1 % salt .
Cells were then grown statically with luminescence , and optical density readings were taken every 20 min .

the SPI1 T3SS ( 56 ) , and similarly provides a proxy for the expression of SPI1 genes ( 20 ) .
The P fimA promoter controls the expression of the six genes encoding type 1 fimbriae ( 69 , 70 ) .
The reason that we chose bacterial luciferase as opposed to other reporters for these experiments is that it is sensitive to dynamic changes in promoter activity ( 30 , 71 ) .
As shown in Fig. 2 , we found that flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial genes are expressed in a temporal hierarchy .
Specifically , the cells first express flagellar genes , followed by SPI1 genes and , lastly , type 1 fimbrial genes .
Hierarchical expression , however , is not entirely surprising as previous studies have shown that the growth phase plays an important role in the timing of activation of these three systems ( 7 , 42 , 67 ) .
In particular , the flagellar genes are maximally expressed during the early log phase , the SPI1 genes during the late exponential phase , and the type 1 fimbrial genes upon entry into stationary phase .
The immediate question then is whether regulatory cross talk plays any role in dictating this transcriptional hierarchy .
Regulatory cross talk tunes gene expression dynamics .
To determine whether the transcriptional hierarchy is due to cross talk , we measured gene expression dynamics in mutants where each system was selectively inactivated .
First , we measured how inactivating flagellar gene expression using the flhDC mutant affected SPI1 and type 1 fimbrial gene expression .
FlhD and FlhC form the FlhD 4 C 2 complex , the master regulator of flagellar gene expression in enteric bacteria ( 37 , 85 ) .
Deleting flhD and flhC shuts off flagellar gene expression ( Fig. 3A ) .
As shown in Fig. 3B , SPI1 gene expression is significantly attenuated in the flhDC mutant .
However , the dynamics of SPI1 gene expression are unchanged ; the times 5770 SAINI ET AL. .
Effect of transcriptional cross talk on flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial gene expression dynamics .
( A to C ) The flagellar genes amplify SPI1 gene expression and delay type 1 fimbrial gene expression .
P flgA ( A ) , P hilA ( B ) , and P fimA ( C ) promoter activities in the wild type and the flhDC mutant are shown .
( D to F ) The SPI1 genes reduce the duration of flagellar gene expression and accelerate the induction of type 1 fimbrial gene expression .
P flgA ( D ) , P hilA ( E ) , and P fimA ( F ) promoter activities in the wild type and the SPI1 mutant are shown .
( G to I ) Type 1 fimbrial genes do not affect flagellar gene expression and reduce the duration of SPI1 gene expression .
P flgA ( G ) , P hilA ( H ) , and P fimA ( I ) promoter activities in the wild type and the fimYZW mutant are shown .
Experiments were performed as described for Fig. 2 .
The mutants were also tested to see whether they affected growth .
However , no change in optical density as a function of time was observed ( data not shown ) .
when SPI1 gene expression is first turned on and then off are the same in the flhDC mutant as in the wild type .
The only change in gene expression is that the magnitude is reduced .
With regard to type 1 fimbriae , we found that gene expression was induced prematurely by roughly an hour in the flhDC mutant compared to that in the wild type ( Fig. 3C ) .
Next , we tested the effect of inactivating SPI1 gene expression .
To do this , we employed a mutant where the entire pathogenicity island was deleted ( SPI1 ) ( 20 ) .
Deleting SPI1 inactivates P hilA promoter activity ( Fig. 3E ) .
The reason is that hilD is required for the transcription of hilA ( 20 , 74 ) .
When we measured gene expression in the SPI1 mutant , we found that the flagellar genes were expressed for an hour longer than they were in the wild type ( Fig. 3D ) .
In the case of the type 1 fimbrial genes ( Fig. 3F ) , we found that their induction was delayed by 30 min in the SPI1 mutant compared to that in the wild type .
Last , we tested the effect of repressing type 1 fimbrial gene expression .
Here , we employed the fimWYZ mutant .
This mutant lacks the three regulatory proteins known to directly regulate type 1 fimbrial gene expression ( 72 , 80 , 81 , 90 ) .
While P fimA promoter activity is not completely repressed in this mutant ( Fig. 3I ) , these three proteins are the ones that would most likely participate in any transcriptional cross talk .
The other known genes in the type 1 fimbrial cluster encode the structural elements of type 1 fimbriae .
When we measured gene expression dynamics in the fimWYZ mutant , we observed no change in flagellar gene expression ( Fig. 3G ) .
However , in the case of the SPI1 genes ( Fig. 3H ) , we found that they are expressed for an hour longer in the fimWYZ mutant than in the wild type .
Collectively , these results demonstrate that the transcriptional hierarchy is not due to regulatory cross talk alone , as initially hypothesized , but rather is controlled predominantly VOL .

FliZ controls the magnitude of SPI1 gene expression and the dynamics of type 1 fimbrial gene expression .
( A to C ) Deleting FliZ represses flagellar and SPI1 gene expression and accelerates the induction of type 1 fimbrial genes .
P flgA ( A ) , P hilA ( B ) , and P fimA ( C ) promoter activities in the wild type and the fliZ mutant are shown .
( D to F ) Overexpressing FliZ increases the magnitude of flagellar and SPI1 gene expression and delays the induction of type 1 fimbrial genes .
P flgA ( D ) , P hilA ( E ) , and P fimA ( F ) promoter activities in the wild type and the fliZ mutant constitutively expressing FliZ from aP LtetO - 1 promoter on a plasmid ( pFliZ ) are shown .
Experiments were performed as described for Fig. 2 .
by the growth phase and external regulatory factors .
Regulatory cross talk , on the other hand , appears to tune gene expression dynamics .
In particular , cross talk primarily regulates the transitions between the different phases of gene expression , with the notable exception being the requirement of flagellar gene expression for maximal SPI1 gene expression .
Next , we tested the role of specific regulators in establishing this cross talk .
FliZ regulates the magnitude of SPI1 gene expression and the timing of type 1 fimbrial gene expression .
The flagellar regulator FliZ is a posttranslational activator of FlhD 4 C 2 ( 71 ) .
In addition , FliZ is a positive regulator of SPI1 gene expression ( 38 , 41 , 53 , 57 , 82 ) .
While the specific mechanism is unknown , FliZ - dependent activation of SPI1 gene expression is known to occur through HilD ( 41 , 53 ) .
To test the specific role of FliZ in regulatory cross talk , we measured flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial gene expression dynamics in the wild type , a fliZ mutant , and a fliZ mutant constitutively expressing FliZ from a plasmid .
Comparing gene expression dynamics in these different strains , we found that FliZ is a positive regulator of flagellar and SPI1 gene expression and a negative regulator of type 1 fimbrial gene expression .
In particular , we found that deleting FliZ decreases the relative magnitudes of flagellar and SPI1 gene expression but does not affect their dynamics ( Fig. 4A and B ) .
Moreover , deleting FliZ accelerates the induction of type 1 fimbrial gene expression ( Fig. 4C ) .
We also found that overexpressing FliZ increases both the magnitudes and durations of flagellar and SPI1 gene expression ( Fig. 4D and E ) , whereas it represses and delays type 1 fimbrial gene expression ( Fig. 4F ) .
Comparison of these results with those obtained using the flhDC mutant suggests that the effect of flagellar gene expression on SPI1 and type 1 fimbrial gene expression is due to FliZ .
Repression of type 1 fimbrial gene expression by FliZ is through FimZ .
While FliZ has previously been shown to regulate SPI1 gene expression in a number of studies ( 38 , 41 , 53 , 57 , 82 ) , its effect on type 1 fimbrial gene expression has not previously been reported to the best of our knowledge .
Therefore , to further characterize this FliZ - dependent repression of type 1 fimbrial gene expression , we sought to determine the genetic target .
To do this , we first compared P fimA promoter activities in the wild type , a fimZ mutant , a fliZ mutant , a fimZ fliZ mutant , a fliZ mutant constitutively expressing FliZ from a plasmid , and a fimZ fliZ mutant also containing the FliZ plasmid .
We performed endpoint measurements after 24 h of growth .
In these experiments , we employed promoter fusions to the fluorescent protein Venus on a plasmid that were identical to the fusions used for the luciferase reporters ( 32 ) .
The reason for using a fluorescent reporter rather than bacterial luciferase is that it is much more stable and thus provides a better measure of integrated promoter activity , as is desired in an endpoint measurement ( 32 ) .
As shown in Fig. 5A , deleting FliZ increases the activity of the P fimA promoter ( P 0.01 ) .
Similarly when FliZ is expressed from a constitutive promoter on a plasmid in an otherwise fliZ background , P fimA promoter activity is repressed ( P 0.01 ) .
However , in the fimZ mutant , we did not observe 5772 SAINI ET AL. .
FliZ regulates type 1 fimbrial gene expression though FimZ .
( A ) FliZ is unable to regulate P fimA promoter activity in the absence of FimZ .
P fimA promoter activities in the wild type , the fimZ mutant , the fliZ mutant , the fimZ fliZ mutant , the fliZ mutant expressing FliZ from the constitutive P LtetO - 1 promoter on a plasmid ( pFliZ ) , and the fimZ fliZ mutant harboring pFliZ are shown .
( B ) FliZ regulates FimZ posttranscriptionally .
P fimA promoter activities in the P fimZ : : tetRA fimY mutant , the P fimZ : : tetRA fimY fliZ mutant , and the P fimZ : : tetRA fimY fliZ mutant expressing FliZ from the constitutive P LtetO - 1 promoter on a plasmid are shown .
In the genetic background P fimZ : : tetRA , FimZ is under the control of a tetracycline - inducible promoter .
Overnight cultures were subcultured 1:1,000 in fresh LB and then grown statically at 37 °C for 24 h. FimZ expression was induced by addition of 15 g/ml tetracycline .
Fluorescence and optical density ( OD600 ) values were then measured for each sample .
Average promoter activities from three independent experiments on separate days are reported .
For each experiment , six samples were tested .
Error bars denote standard deviations .
any additional change in promoter activity when FliZ was also removed ( P 0.20 ) .
When FliZ was expressed from a plasmid in an otherwise fimZ fliZ background , we observed a minor decrease in P fimA promoter activity , though the effect was only marginally significant ( P 0.04 ) .
We also performed similar experiments with FimY and found that FliZ is still able to regulate the P fimA promoter in the absence of FimY ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that FliZ does not directly repress P fimA promoter activity .
We next tested whether FliZ represses type 1 fimbrial gene expression through FimZ .
To test this hypothesis , we employed a strain where FimZ was constitutively expressed .
Specifically , we replaced the P fimZ promoter with the tetracycline - inducible tetRA element from transposon Tn10 ( P fimZ : : tetRA ) .
This arrangement decouples FimZ expression from its native regulation and causes it to be constitutively expressed from its native chromosomal locus in the presence of tetracycline .
In addition , we also deleted FimY so that regulation was dependent entirely on FimZ ( FimW is a negative regulator of type 1 fimbrial gene expression and operates through FimY [ 72 ] ) .
When we tested the effect of FliZ in a P fimZ : : tetRA fimY genetic background , we found that deleting FliZ increases P fimA promoter activity ( P 0.01 ) whereas constitutively expressing FliZ represses it ( P 0.01 ) ( Fig. 5B ) .
We also performed similar experiments with FimY and found that FliZ has no effect ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that FliZ regulates type 1 fimbrial gene expression through FimZ .
One possibility is that FliZ posttranscriptionally regulates FimZ in a manner similar to FlhD 4 C 2 and HilD .
Alternatively , FliZ may prevent FimZ from activating the P fimA promoter .
RtsB directly regulates the dynamics of flagellar gene expression and indirectly regulates the dynamics of SPI1 and type 1 fimbrial gene expression through FliZ .
RtsB has previously been shown to bind to the P flhDC promoter and repress flagellar gene expression ( 22 ) .
While RtsB does not reside within SPI1 , it is located in the same operon as RtsA , an AraC - like regulator of SPI1 gene expression .
This two - gene operon requires HilD for expression , and its expression is correlated with the other SPI1 genes ( 20 , 22 ) .
To understand how RtsB contributes to transcriptional cross talk , we measured the P flgA , P hilA , and P fimA promoter activities in the wild type , an rtsB mutant , and an rtsB mutant where RtsB was constitutively expressed from a plasmid .
Comparing gene expression dynamics in these different mutants , we found that RtsB represses the dynamics of both flagellar and SPI1 gene expression and accelerates type 1 fimbrial gene expression .
In the rtsB mutant , we found that flagellar genes are expressed for roughly an hour longer ( Fig. 6A ) and that the induction of type 1 fimbrial gene expression is weakly delayed ( Fig. 6C ) .
No change in SPI1 gene expression , however , was observed ( Fig. 6B ) .
When RtsB is constitutively expressed , we found that it completely inhibits flagellar gene expression ( Fig. 6D ) .
It also represses SPI1 gene expression ( Fig. 6E ) and accelerates the induction of type 1 fimbrial genes by roughly 1 h ( Fig. 6F ) .
As we observed similar dynamic responses in the rtsB and SPI1 mutants , we conclude that the effect of SPI1 genes on flagellar and type 1 fimbrial gene expression is most likely due to RtsB .
To explain our overexpression experiments , we note the following .
While RtsB has been shown to directly repress flagellar gene expression , it is not believed to directly regulate SPI1 gene expression ( 22 ) .
Most likely , its effect on SPI1 gene expression is through FliZ .
In particular , when RtsB is constitutively expressed , SPI1 gene expression dynamics mirror those in the flhDC mutant .
Similarly , RtsB is likely also affecting type 1 fimbrial gene expression through FliZ .
To prove this , we compared P fimA promoter activities in the wild type , the rtsB mutant , the fliZ mutant , the fliZ rtsB mutant , and the rtsB and fliZ rtsB mutants constitutively expressing RtsB , using endpoint measurements after 24 h of growth .
Consistent with our hypothesis , we found that RtsB has no effect on type 1 fimbrial gene expression in the absence of FliZ ( Fig. 6G ) .
Specifically , we found no change in P fimA promoter activity VOL .

when RtsB was deleted ( P 0.8 ) or expressed on a plasmid ( P 0.95 ) .
However , we qualify this analysis by noting that RtsB itself has only a marginal statistical effect on P fimA promoter activity as determined using endpoint measurements ( P 0.03 ) .
FimZ regulates the dynamics of SPI1 gene expression and is the link between the type 1 fimbrial genes and the flagellar and SPI1 genes .
FimZ is a positive regulator of type 1 fimbrial gene expression ( 90 , 91 ) .
FimZ has also been shown to bind the P flhDC promoter and repress flagellar gene expression ( 10 ) .
In addition , it represses SPI1 gene expression by increasing the expression of HilE , a negative regulator of SPI1 gene expression ( 72 ) .
To determine the contribution of FimZ to regulatory cross talk , we compared gene expression dynamics in the wild type , the fimZ mutant , and a strain where FimZ is constitutively expressed ( P fimZ : : tetRA ) .
In the fimZ mutant , we found that flagellar gene expression is unchanged ( Fig. 7A ) , whereas the SPI1 genes were expressed for an additional 30 min relative to their expression in the wild type ( Fig. 7B ) .
We also found that type 1 fimbrial gene 5774 SAINI ET AL. .
FimZ controls the dynamics of SPI1 gene expression .

FimZ expression was induced by addition of 15 g/ml tetracycline .
Experiments were performed as described for Fig. 2 .
expression was reduced roughly 2 - fold ( Fig. 7C ) .
When FimZ was constitutively expressed , however , we found that both the flagellar and SPI1 genes were repressed ( Fig. 7D and E ) .
Also , as expected , type 1 fimbrial gene expression was significantly accelerated when FimZ was constitutively expressed .
Comparison of these results with those obtained using the fimWYZ mutant suggests that FimZ is the link between type 1 fimbrial genes and flagellar and SPI1 gene expression as similar dynamic behaviors were observed in the two mutants .
Interestingly , we found that deleting FimZ had no significant effect on flagellar gene expression .
This is probably due to the fact that , under physiological conditions , the type 1 fimbrial genes are expressed long after the flagellar genes no longer are .
Only when FimZ is constitutively expressed is repression seen .
Similarly , the repression of the SPI1 gene is likely due to a combination of increased HilE expression and reduced flagellar gene expression .
DISCUSSION Salmonella enterica needs to coordinate the expression of a diverse number of cellular systems during the infection cycle ( 28 , 31 , 34 , 36 , 50 , 63 , 75 ) .
In this study , we investigated the dynamic regulation of three of these systems , namely , flagella , the SPI1 T3SS , and type 1 fimbriae .
We were able to demonstrate that these three systems are expressed sequentially during in - vitro growth .
This hierarchy in gene expression could mirror the roles of these three systems during the infection cycle .
According to this simplified model , Salmonella first needs to swim to the sites of invasion in the distal small intestine .
Logically then , the flagellar genes are expressed first .
Upon reaching its target sites for invasion , Salmonella stops synthesizing flagella as movement is no longer required and starts to synthesize the SPI1 T3SSs necessary for invasion .
Once the bacterium enters the stationary - phase , it stops synthesizing the SPI1 T3SSs and begins to express the type 1 fimbrial genes involved in intestinal colonization and persistence ( 1 , 19 , 49 ) .
In vivo , we imagine that this last step is necessary only in those bacteria that were unable to breach the intestinal epithelium .
As multiple studies have shown that extensive regulatory interactions exist between these three systems ( 5 , 10 , 22 , 38 , 72 ) , we hypothesized that regulatory cross talk may govern the hierarchy .
However , we found that transcriptional hierarchy is controlled predominately by external factors , external in the sense that the hierarchy is not due to known interactions among these three systems .
Cross talk , rather , appears to tune the hierarchy .
In particular , cross talk between these three systems is critical for regulating gene expression during transition phases in the hierarchy .
The one exception is the effect of FliZ on SPI1 gene expression dynamics .
Among the regulators underlying this cross talk , we found that FliZ is the most significant as it regulates both SPI1 and type 1 fimbrial gene expression , where the latter is a novel finding of this study .
Moreover , FliZ 's effect on SPI1 gene expression is profound , reducing the expression roughly 3 - fold .
While FimZ also regulates flagellar and SPI1 gene expression , the effects are minor and are really seen only when the regulator is constitutively expressed .
Interestingly , unlike RtsB and FimZ , FliZ does not appear to directly regulate transcription VOL .
192 , 2010 COORDINATE REGULATION OF SALMONELLA GENE EXPRESSION 5775 FIG. 8 .
( A ) Diagram of transcriptional cross talk between the flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial gene systems .
( B ) Inferred logic of transcriptional cross talk , where the decision to `` move '' results from flagellar gene expression , the decision to `` invade '' results from SPI1 gene expression , and the decision to `` persist '' results from type 1 fimbrial gene expression .
in these three systems .
Rather , FliZ appears to function through another transcription factor , be it FlhD 4 C 2 ( 71 ) , HilD ( 41 ) , or FimZ .
While the underlying mechanism of action of FliZ is still unclear , our data imply that it is posttranslational in all three systems .
One outstanding question concerns the physiological role of this regulatory cross talk between the flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial genes .
In particular , cross talk has a relatively minor role in regulating the hierarchical expression of these three systems , at least under the conditions investigated in this study .
As a comparison , the most well - characterized example of regulatory cross talk involves the hierarchical expression of carbohydrate transport and metabolic genes during - growth on mixed substrates .
In that case , transcriptional cross talk is used to enforce a strict hierarchy in carbohydrate utilization ( 17 , 64 ) .
While we also can not discount that other factors associated with the flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial systems are involved in regulating the transcriptional hierarchy , we expect that the hierarchy is not due to cross talk but rather is regulated by external factors .
Specifically , based on our current understanding , we believe that these three systems are regulated in response to the growth phase of the cell ( Fig. 2 ) .
Why then is cross talk employed ?
If we consider the logic of this cross talk , then a simple pattern emerges ( Fig. 8 ) .
Specifically , cross talk appears to make the expression of these three systems mutually exclusive , though only to the degree to which they are expressed during the infection cycle .
In this regard , it helps to reinforce the transcriptional hierarchy .
For example , the expression of the flagellar genes represses the expression of the type 1 fimbrial genes and vice versa .
This mutual repression is perfectly logical when considering that Salmonella can not move and adhere / persist at the same time .
Similarly , the expression of the flagellar genes enhances SPI1 gene expression , whereas the expression of the SPI1 gene represses flagellar gene expression .
Regulation in this case would suggest that only actively motile cells try to invade .
As a corollary , persisting cells do not invade , consistent with the fact that the expression of the type 1 fimbrial genes represses the expression of the SPI1 genes .
Lastly , once the cells decide to invade , logically then motility is no longer required .
One limitation of this model is that it does not account for all the other systems involved in the infection cycle .
For example , Salmonella has at least 13 distinct fimbrial systems ( 68 ) whose expression might also be coordinated with the expression of flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial genes .
Salmonella also possesses a nonfimbrial adhesin encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 4 ( SPI4 ) ( 28 ) .
Previously , we demonstrated that the expression of the SPI4 adhesin is regulated by SprB , a SPI1 - encoded regulator ( 73 ) .
Aside from fimbriae and adhesins , Salmonella also possesses a second T3SS encoded within Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) ( 34 ) .
The SPI2 T3SS is used to survive and replicate within host cells during systemic phases of infection .
The SPI2 genes also play a role in inducing intestinal inflammation and are known to be regulated by HilD , a SPI1 regulator ( 7 ) .
However , chemical and environmental cues are required to activate SPI2 gene expression , most notably low Mg 2 concentrations ( 16 ) and acidic pH ( 6 ) ; HilD is not required for SPI2 gene expression during systemic infection ( 20 ) .
How the cells coordinate the expression of SPI1 and SPI2 genes is still not well understood .
Clearly , this model of the coordinate expression of Salmonella virulence genes ( Fig. 8 ) is still incomplete , as it considers only a small subset of the systems involved in the infection cycle .
In addition , it is based on just one mode of growth .
Likely , cross talk is more significant when growth is irregular and the environment is variable , as opposed to our in - vitro experiments where growth is uninterrupted and the environment is fixed .
Further investigations are necessary to fully characterize the role of regulatory cross talk in coordinating gene expression during invasion .
The significance of this study is that it is the first to systemically study the effect of regulatory cross talk on the expression dynamics of flagellar , SPI1 , and type 1 fimbrial genes .
