62 , No. 11 Further Characterization of the PhoP Regulon : Identification of New PhoP - Activated Virulence Loci WILLIAM J. BELDEN ANr SAMUEL I. MILLER * Infectious Disease Unit , Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02114 Salmonella typhimurium survival within macrophages is an essential virulence property necessary to enteric fever pathogenesis .
This survival requires coordinate transcriptional activation of virulence genes within acidified macrophage phagosomes .
Virulence gene transcription is regulated by a two - component system comprising the PhoP ( transcriptional activator ) and PhoQ ( sensor - kinase ) proteins .
Thirteen new PhoPactivated loci ( designated pagD to pagP ) encoding membrane or secreted proteins have been identified by use of the transposon TnphoA .
Three of these loci have a chromosomal location that was linked to the previously identified pagC locus .
Strains with TnphoA insertions in pagD , pagi , pagK , and pagM were significantly attenuated for mouse virulence ( 50 % o lethal dose greater than 1,000 times that of wild - type bacteria ) .
No strains with pag. : TnphoA insertions were found to have altered sensitivity to the cationic antimicrobial peptide NP - 1 defensin .
PhoP and PhoQ are pleotropic regulators of membrane or secreted proteins , suggesting that the ability to effect a global change in the expression of these proteins is required for S. typhimurium survival within acidified macrophage phagosomes .
Salmonellae are enteric pathogens that cause a wide range of host - specific illnesses , including gastroenteritis and enteric fever ( 15 ) .
Salmonella typhimurium infection of BALB/c mice results in a systemic illness similar to human enteric ( typhoid ) fever , with bacteria disseminating to organs rich in phagocytic cells ( 5 ) .
Consistent with this observation , S. typhimurium survival within macrophages has been correlated with mouse virulence ( 9 ) .
After phagocytosis , S. typhimurium remains within macrophage phagosomes and survives , perhaps in part , by forming a novel intracellular structure termed a spacious phagosome ( SP ) ( 1 ) .
The SP has delayed and attenuated acidification which may promote bacterial survival ( 1 , 2 ) .
The S. typhimurium two - component transcriptional regulatory system , PhoP - PhoQ , responds to signals within the acidified macrophage phagosome environment to induce phoPactivated gene ( pag ) transcription ( 2 ) .
The PhoP and PhoQ proteins are similar to a family of bacterial regulatory proteins that control transcription in response to environmental signals ( 25 ) .
By analogy to these similar systems , the PhoQ sensorkinase responds to the acidified macrophage phagosome environment by transfer of phosphate to PhoP .
Phosphorylated PhoP then binds to pag DNA to activate transcription ( 24 , 25 , 35 ) İn addition to the ability of PhoP - PhoQ to activate gene transcription , these regulators can also repress the synthesis of phoP - repressed gene ( pig ) products ( 3 , 26 ) .
The phenotype of PhoP - constitutive mutants includes defective SP formation and reduced endocytosis by epithelial cells , as well as global repression of prg ( 1 , 3 , 26 ) .
Therefore , pig products are predicted to interact with mammalian cell surfaces .
In macrophages , prg products are required for the induction of diffuse macrophage membrane ruffling , increased macropinocytosis , and formation of SP ( 1 ) .
In contrast , pag products are involved in a later stage of bacterial parasitism of macrophages , as transcriptional activation occurs 3 to 5 h after phagocytosis * 7416 .

5095 when the phagosome pH drops below 5.0 ( 2 ) .
This occurs when most SPs have shrunk in volume ( 1 , 2 ) .
Since phoP mutants of S. typhimurium are markedly defective in mouse virulence and survival within macrophages , the identification and characterization ofpag gene products should lead to greater insight into the mechanism of bacterial survival within acidified macrophage phagosomes .
Two - dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of proteins from strains with constitutive activation of PhoP - PhoQ predicted that genes encoding approximately 20 proteins were positively activated by PhoP ( 26 ) .
Prior to this work four pag loci that require phoP for transcription were identified : phoN which encodes a nonspecific acid phosphatase and pag4 , - B , and - C ( 16 , 25 ) .
In addition , a locus induced by phosphate - starvation , psiD , is partially regulated by PhoP ( 11 ) .
Of these previously defined pag loci , only pagC has been directly implicated in bacterial virulence ( 11 , 25 , 30 ) .
PagC is a 118 - amino - acid envelope protein that is a member of a protein family associated with diverse phenotypes , including complement sensitivity , epithelial cell invasion , and antibiotic resistance ( 14 , 29 , 30 , 36 ) .
The virulence attenuation of pagC mutant strains was significantly less than that of phoP null mutants , suggesting that other unidentified pag loci may be important to bacterial virulence ( 25 ) .
We therefore proceeded to identify new pag loci in hopes of better understanding the mechanisms by which bacteria can survive within phagocytic cells and produce disease .
MATERLALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and plasmids .
The bacterial strains used in this work are listed in Table 1 .
Media and chemical reagents .
Luria broth ( LB ) was used as a rich growth medium ( 32 ) .
The chromogenic substrate 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl phosphate ( XP ) was used in agar at a concentration of 40 jig/ml to detect alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) activity .
Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations : chloramphenicol , 25 , .
g/ml ; kanamycin , 45 jig/ml ; tetracycline , 8 to 25 , ug/ml ; and gentamicin , 30 , ug/ml .
5096 BELDEN AND MILLER INFECT .
TnphoA mutagenesis of strain CSO19 was performed by using the broad - host - range plasmid pRT291 ( 37 ) .
P22HTint bacteriophage was used in all transductional crosses ( 7 ) .
Screening for phoP - activated genes was performed as previously described ( 25 ) .
AP - active strains were screened for PhoP regulation by transductional crosses with a P22 bacteriophage lysate grown on strain AD154 containing the purB1744 : : TnlO allele .
These crosses were plated on LB agar containing tetracycline , kanamycin , and XP .
Candidate pag - phoA gene fusions were identified as strains in which approximately 70 % of colonies demonstrated reduction or loss of the blue colony phenotype on acquisition of the purB1744 : : TnlO allele .
This result was expected for strains containing pag - phoA fusions because the phoP12 allele of AD154 is - 70 % linked to purB1744 : : TnlO .
P22 bacteriophage lysates generated on these candidate strains were used in transductional crosses with the original parent , CSO19 , to generate new strains that contained the candidate pag - phoA gene fusion .
This insured that such strains did not contain the incP plasmid pPHlJI , which may interfere with virulence testing , and reduced the probability that strains contained multiple TnphoA insertions .
Candidate pag : : TnphoA strains were then converted to a PhoP null phenotype by transductional crosses using strain TT13208 as the donor of the phoP105 : : TnlOd allele and were selected on agar containing tetracycline .
Blot hybridization experiments were then performed , using an 845 - bp DNA fragment of TnphoA as a probe , to confirm that all strains compared contained an identical TnphoA insertion .
Once these candidate pag : : TnphoA strains were demonstrated to be isogenic except for the phoP locus , AP activity was assayed .
Measurement of AP activity .
Determination of AP activity of strains containing TnphoA was performed as previously described using the substrate p - nitrophenyl - phosphate ( Ameresco , Solon , Ohio ) ( 22 ) .
The results were expressed in units calculated as for , - galactosidase using the formula of Miller ( 23 ) .
Linkage analysis ofphoP - activated genes .
The chromosomal locations of pag : : TnphoA fusions were determined by using a bank of randomly spaced Tn1OA16A17 insertions ( 17 , 33 ) .
A multiprong innoculator was used to perform multiple transductional crosses .
Colonies were selected on XP agar plates containing 8 , ug of tetracycline as previously described ( 17 ) .
Candidate strains with transposon insertions linked to TnphoA VOL .
62 , 1994 were identified by a mixture of white and blue colony phenotypes observed in transductants .
Linkage was subsequently confirmed and quantitated by screening for loss of kanamycin resistance in 200 individual transductants .
In addition , physical maps of the restriction endonuclease sites surrounding the TnphoA insertion were determined by blot hybridization experiments using a probe comprising an 845 - bp DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 99 to 944 of TnphoA .
Chromosomal DNA was prepared as previously described except that proteinase K was used instead of pronase ( 21 ) .
Restriction endonucleases were obtained from BRL - GIBCO ( Grand Island , N.Y. ) , and reactions were performed as recommended by the manufacturer .
Blot hybridization experiments were performed with a Genescreen Plus membrane ( DuPont , NEN ) and a digoxigenin - labeled probe .
Chemiluminescence detection was performed with an antidigoxigenin Fab fragment with Lumiphos as the substrate ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , Ind. ) .
PCR was performed with reaction mixes and buffers supplied by Perkin - Elmer Cetus ( Norwalk , Conn. ) .
Strains with TnphoA insertions were assayed for sensitivity to the rabbit neutrophil defensin NP - 1 ( a gift of Michael Selsted ) in low - ionic - strength buffer as previously described ( 8 , 27 ) .
Approximately 106 bacteria per ml from a logarithmic - growth - phase culture were incubated at 37 °C in 0.5 % tryptone - 0.05 % acetic acid with or without 35 , ug of NP - 1 per ml .
After 2 h bacteria were diluted in normal saline to stop antibacterial activity and plated for CFU to determine the number of viable organisms .
Female adult BALB/c mice weighing approximately 20 g were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratory Inc. ( Wilmington , Mass. ) .
Bacteria were grown aerobically at 37 °C to stationary - phase .
Bacteria were diluted in normal saline and injected intraperitoneally in an innoculum of 0.2 ml .
The number of organisms administered was quantitated by plating for CFU on LB agar .
The care of all animals was under institutional guidelines as set by the animal care committee of the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School .
Mouse 50 % lethal doses ( LD50s ) were determined by the method of Reed and Muench ( 31 ) .
The LD50 was determined by using a total of 30 mice at three doses on two separate occasions .
Bacterial survival within macrophages .
Experiments were performed as previously described ( 4 , 25 ) .
Stationary - phase cells were opsonized for 30 min in 10 % normal mouse serum before exposure to cultured bone marrow - derived macrophages harvested from BALB/c mice .
One hour after infection , gentamicin sulfate ( 8 ug/ml ) was added to kill extracellular bacteria .
Infected macrophages were harvested in conjunction with the addition of gentamicin and at various times after the antibiotic was added .
The number of viable bacteria was determined by harvesting in 0.5 % deoxycolate , diluting in normal saline , and plating for CFU .
Samples at all time points were taken in triplicate , and experiments were repeated on four separate occasions .
NEW PhoP - ACTIVATED VIRULENCE LOCI 5097 RESULTS Isolation of strains with transposon insertions in phoPactivated genes .
To further analyze the role of phoP - activated genes in bacterial virulence , a bank of strains with active phoA gene fusions was generated by TnphoA mutagenesis .
Strain CS019 was used as the parent strain for TnphoA mutagenesis because it has wild - type bacterial virulence and carries the phoN2 allele , which results in minimal background phosphatase activity ( 25 ) .
Strains with active phoA gene fusions were identified by blue colony phenotype after growth in agar containing XP .
Such strains were then screened for decreased fusion protein activity on acquisition of the phoP12 allele , which results in a PhoP null phenotype .
Two thousand and sixty - four AP - expressing strains were isolated and colony purified from 240 independent matings .
Strains with AP activity were isolated at a frequency of 0.8 % from the total pool of kanamycin - resistant ( TnphoA - containing ) bacteria .
A total of 54 candidate pag : : TnphoA insertions were isolated from the AP - expressing strain bank , and 49 of these were determined to have greater than a sixfold reduction in AP activity in the absence of functional phoP - phoQ .
Therefore , approximately 2 % of the colonies expressing AP were identified as havingpag - phoA gene fusions .
Identification of 13 unique pag loci .
Three methods were used to determine whether the 49 TnphoA insertions defined unique pag loci .
First , physical maps of the EcoRI and HindIII restriction endonuclease sites 5 ' to the TnphoA insertions were defined .
Second , analysis of linkage to transposon insertions highly linked to known pag loci was performed .
Third , strains determined to be unique by the above methods were screened for linkage to a bank of strains with transposon insertions of known chromosomal location .
The blot hybridization analysis demonstrated that 13 of the 49 strains had unique restriction endonuclease sites 5 ' to the TnphoA insertion ( Fig. 1 ) .
The numbers of strains with similar physical maps 5 ' to the TnphoA insertion ranged from one to seven .
One of the thirteen physical maps was similar to that expected for an insertion inpagC and was noted in seven of the strains isolated as containing candidate pag : : TnphoA insertions .
Analysis of these seven strains indicated that only three contained pagC : : TnphoA insertions , since blot hybridization analysis with a fragment of pagC as a probe and analysis of linkage to transposon insertions highly linked to pagC indicated that four of these insertions were not in pagC ( data not shown ) .
Another of the pag : - phoA fusions , denoted pagP , had the physical 5 ' restriction endonuclease map that would be expected forphoN .
However this insertion was determined not to be withinphoN by linkage analysis and blot hybridization .
A transductional cross was performed between wild - type bacteria and strain CS1247 containing pagP : : TnphoA and zxx : : 6215 TnlOd - Cm , which is 95 % linked to phoN , by bacteriophage P22 transduction .
The transductants were selected on kanamycin , insuring the inheritance of pagP : : TnphoA , which encodes kanamycin resistance .
These colonies were then screened for chloramphenicol resistance , which would indicate linkage of zxx : : 6215TnlOd - Cm to pagP .
No linkage was found , indicating that pagP was not linked to phoN .
Blot hybridization using a portion of phoN as a probe was also performed with CS1247 and indicated that this strain contained a wild - type phoN locus ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , 13 newpag loci were defined and designated pagD to - P. To further define the PhoP regulation of the 13pag : : TnphoA fusion proteins , AP activity was assayed in strains isogenic except for the phoP locus .
Strains with a pagC : : TnphoA insertion and a random TnphoA insertion whose fusion protein activity was not regulated by PhoP - PhoQ were assayed and used as controls .
AP activity was assayed during bacterial growth in rich - medium in logarithmic and stationary growth phases ( Table 2 ) .
The dependence of an intact phoP locus for full expression remained constant for the different stages of growth ; however , consistent with previous data , the relative amount of AP expression increased as growth was limited ( 3 , 30 ) .
The difference in expression of pag gene fusions varied 5098 BELDEN AND MILLER A B 23 kb - 9.4 kb 6.6 kb - 4.4 kb 2.3 kb 2.0 kb 0.5 kb - 23 kb - 9.4 kb - 6.6 kb 4.4 kb 2.3 kb - 2.0 kb 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 AUM -40 AM FIG. 1 .
Blot hybridization of Salmonella chromosomal DNA from pag : : TnphoA mutant bacteria .
Chromosomal DNA digested with restriction endonucleases EcoRI ( A ) and HindIII ( B ) was size fractionated in agarose gels , transferred to a membrane , and probed with a fragment of the phoA gene .
The lanes contain chromosomal DNA from strains with TnphoA inserted in the indicated loci : 1 , pagL ; 2 , pagN ; 3 , pagM ; 4 , pagI ; 5 , pagH ; 6 , pagG ; 7 , pagE ; 8 , pagK ; 9 , pagJ ; 10 , pagD ; 11 , pagP ; 12 , pagO ; 13 , pagF .
The size markers are the positions of bands from a X HindIII digest .
The hybridizing bands contain 768 nucleotides of TnphoA in the EcoRI digests and 3,111 nucleotides of TnphoA in the HindIII digests .
from 6 - to 48 - fold when isogenic strains with a wild - type and null phoP locus were compared .
Of the five previously identified pag loci , only phoN , pagC , and pagA have known chromosomal locations .
Linkage analysis of the 13 newly identified pag loci was performed using strains containing transposon insertions linked to pagC ( AK3233 and AK3140 ) and to pagA ( AK3255 ) ( 25 ) .
Three pag : : TnphoA insertions were found to be linked to the transposon insertion of AK3140 in a region near pagC at 24 to 25 min on the chromosome .
These were designated pagD , pagE , and pagF .
pagD : : TnphoA was similarily linked to the transposon insertions of AK3233 ( 83 % ) and AK3140 ( 33 % ) , as was previously reported for pagC .
The TnphoA insertion of this strain has been further defined and is divergently transcribed from pagC ( 13 ) .
pagE and pagF exhibited different linkage to the insertions of AK3233 and AK3140 than didpagC andpagD , suggesting a significantly different chromosomal location .
The pagE : : TnphoA insertion is 39 % linked to the transposon insertion of AK3233 and 99.1 % linked to that of AK3140 , while pagF : : TnphoA is 31 % linked to the insertion of AK3140 but is not linked to that of AK3233 .
These different linkages , in addition to the physical maps of the restriction endonuclease sites 5 ' to the TnphoA insertions , indicated that these were new pag loci .
Therefore , three newpag loci were found in the region TABLE 2 .

of 25 min , one of which is highly linked to the previously defined pagC .
Linkage analysis was then performed using a group of defined random TnJOA16A17 insertions and the 10 strains with TnphoA insertions of no known location ( 17 ) .
Of these 10 pag : : TnphoA alleles , only 2 demonstrated linkage to the bank of TnJOA16A17 insertions .
The pagG : : TnphoA insertion was demonstrated to have 97 % linkage to the transposon insertion of AK3258 located at approximately 30 min .
The pag : : TnphoA insertion , designated pagH , exhibited 23 % linkage to the insertion of AK3091 .
The linkage to the transposon insertion of AK3091 was similar to that ( 26 % ) previously demonstrated forprgE ( 3 ) .
Therefore , this chromosomal region contains both PhoP - activated and repressed genes .
This TnJOA16A17 insertion was analyzed by pulsed - field gradient electrophoresis of chromosomal DNA from AK3091 , digested with the restriction endonucleases XbaI and BlnI , by Ken Sanderson and Andrew Heffel of the Salmonella Stock Center ( 19 ) .
On the basis of this analysis the transposon insertion of AK3091 was located in the region of 20 to 25 min ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , pagH and prgE are located in this region .
Strains with pag. : TnphoA insertions have wild - type sensitivity to the rabbit NP - 1 defensin .
S. typhimurium strains with null mutations in the phoP operon have increased sensitivity to a variety of cationic antimicrobial peptides including defensins , magainins , and protamine ( 8 , 12 , 27 ) .
The defensins are a family of mammalian peptides present in the granules of neutrophils , lung macrophages , and intestinal Paneth cells ( 18 , 34 ) .
Resistance to these peptides may contribute to bacterial virulence and the ability to colonize mucosal surfaces .
Therefore , we tested strains with pag : : TnphoA insertions for sensitivity to the highly active rabbit defensin NP - 1 .
None of the strains with single pag : : TnphoA insertions demonstrated in - VOL .

Comparison of sensitivities of wild - type ( ATCC 14028 ) , PhoP null mutant ( CSO15 ) , and pug : : TnphoA mutant strains to NP - 1 defensin .
The y axis shows the defensin killing index ( DKI ) , which represents bacteria killed on exposure to NP - i .
The DKI is defined as the logarithmic function of the ratio of control bacteria to surviving bacteria incubated with NP - i [ DKI = log ( CFUJ without NP - 1 / CFU with NP - i ) ] .
The individual bars represent the means and standard errors of five separate experiments .
The designation on the x axis indicates the allele mutated .
The mean DKI for each of the pag : : TnphoA strains tested was determined not to be different from that of wild - type S. typhimurium ( P > 0.05 ) .
In contrast , the DKI for the phoP mutant was significantly different ( P < 0.001 ) .
creased sensitivity to the NP - i defensin ( Fig. 2 ) .
Thus , despite the demonstrated sensitivity of PhoP null mutants to rabbit defensin NP - i , no defined mutations in pug loci were associated with sensitivity to defensins .
Four strains with pag. : TnphoA insertions demonstrate marked attenuation in mouse virulence .
To further define whether these newpag loci contributed to mouse virulence , the 13 strains with pug transposon insertions were screened by intraperitoneal injection of mice with approximately 100 organisms .
Four strains with transposon insertions in pagD , pagJ !
, pagK , and pagM demonstrated attenuated virulence .
Mice injected with these strains all survived and showed no signs of systemic infections , such as hepatosplenomegaly and scruffiness ( piloerection due to fever ) .
These four strains were subjected to further virulence testing by intraperitoneal injection of multiple doses of organisms on two separate occasions .
The mean LD50s were determined from these subsequent injections and are listed in Table 3 .
One of these strains , containing the pagD : : TnphoA insertion , has an LD50 10,000 - fold greater than that of wild - type S. typhimunium ( 13 ) .
The other three strains were also markedly attenuated for mouse virulence , with LD50 values greater than 1,000 to 10,000 times that of wild - type organisms .
Therefore , we identified new PhoP - regulated loci that , when mutated , resulted in attenuation of bacterial virulence for mice .
pag. : TnphoA strains attenuated for mouse virulence have reduced survival within macrophages .
Since PhoP mutant salmonellae are deficient in survival within macrophages , we tested strains containing mutations in pag genes that had attenuated mouse virulence for reduced viability within macrophages .
As can be seen in Table 3 , all strains with pag mutations demonstrated significantly reduced survival within macrophages .
Consistent with previous observations of pag expression within macrophages , decreased intracellular survival of pag mutants was not observed until a time that pag is predicted to be maximally expressed ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION In this report we describe the identification of 13 new loci positively activated by PhoP - PhoQ , the S. typhimurium twocomponent virulence regulatory system .
These phoP - activated loci ( pag ) were identified as translational gene fusions to phoA that produced AP and thus are predicted to encode membrane or secreted proteins .
Chromosomal locations were determined for five of these loci .
pagG was found to be located at 30 min on the chromosome , and pagH was located in the region of 20 to 25 min .
Three loci were determined to be located at 25 min and linked to the previously identified pagC gene .
Four genes highly linked to pagC , including pagD , have a low G+C content , and it is possible that this region evolved as a genetic element that promotes survival within macrophages ( 13 ) .
Though we have not shown that these newly identified pag loci are transcriptionally regulated by PhoP , the prior defined regulation of pagA to - C suggests that PhoP directly regulates transcription of these newly defined loci .
Four strains with mutations in the pagD , pagJ , pagK , and pagM loci were found to be attenuated for mouse virulence and survival within macrophages .
The identification of these virulence loci , when included with the previously discovered pagC locus , brings the number of pag loci implicated in mouse virulence to five .
Strains with mutations in these fivepag loci all had various degrees of virulence attenuation .
Strains with a mutation in pagJ had a virulence defect comparable to that observed for pagC mutants ( greater than 1,000 times the LD50 of wild - type organisms ) .
The pagD : : TnphoA insertion resulted in the greatest attenuation of virulence , comparable to that of a PhoP null mutation ( greater than 10,000 times the LD50 of wild - type organisms ) .
pagK and pagM mutants had virulence attenuation that was intermediate between that of the pagJ and pagD mutants .
The cumulative effect of deletion ofpagC , pagD , pagJ , pagK , and pagM , if similar to the attenuation observed with TnphoA insertions , could be much greater than that observed with deletion of phoP alone if these genes are partially expressed in - vivo in PhoP mutants .
The finding that many of these genes are somewhat expressed in stationary phase in the absence of PhoP suggests that functional Pag proteins could be produced in - vivo in the absence of PhoP .
One virulence gene , pagM , is significantly expressed in the absence of PhoP , though it may still require PhoP - PhoQ for induction within macrophage phagosomes .
These data suggest that deletion of pag gene products could lead to greater virulence attenuation than deletion of the regulatory proteins .
Though the virulence data we have generated implicates 5100 BELDEN AND MILLER TABLE 3 .

b The macrophage survival index ( MSI ) was determined by dividing the mean Salmonella CFU recovered from macrophage cultures ( performed in triplicate ) 24 h after the addition of gentamicin by the mean Salmonella CFU recovered from macrophages 1 h after gentamicin was added .
involvement of the pagJ , - K , - M , and - D loci in virulence , it is possible that induction of expression of AP fusion proteins within macrophages could result in virulence attenuation of S. typhimurium by altering bacterial ability to survive within macrophages .
Strains that produce fusion proteins that alter bacterial secretion or other normal processes essential to virulence could have effects that are not directly the result of a null mutation in the identifiedpag locus ( 28 ) .
If this is the case , it must not be true for all pag fusion proteins , as only a subset of strains with pag - phoA gene fusions are attenuated for virulence .
Additionally , transposons may have polar effects on the transcription of another gene linked to the pag locus identified as a virulence locus .
Therefore , the confirmation that the loci we have identified are essential to microbial virulence and survival within macrophages will require further study , including virulence testing of strains with deletions of these loci .
It is also possible that the pag loci identified in strains with pag : : TnphoA insertions that had wild - type mouse virulence may still contribute to microbial pathogenesis .
The pagA and pagB loci , identified in strains as MudJ insertions that do not alter bacterial virulence , are transcriptionally induced within macrophages , as are likely allpag loci , as part of the coordinate regulation of the operon .
It would seem pointless to induce these genes within macrophage phagosomes if they did not perform a specific survival function .
No virulence defect would be detected in strains with single pag mutations if pag encodes redundant functions necessary for survival within macrophages .
In addition , transposon insertions within pag may define operons that contain virulence genes whose transcription is not altered by the inserted mobile genetic element .
Therefore , complete identification and characterization of the entire PhoP operon may be necessary to dissect the complex roles that these genes and gene products have in interacting with macrophages .
The fact that this study revealed that manypag loci encode membrane or secreted proteins is remarkable .
In contrast , the major regulators of porin synthesis , OmpR and EnvZ , regulate only a tripeptide permease in addition to the porins ( 10 ) .
The Pho regulon of Escherichia coli includes only six loci encoding membrane and periplasmic proteins necessary to phosphate acquisition and regulation , though a number of phosphateregulated loci remain incompletely characterized ( 38 ) .
The coordinate regulation of a large number of loci encoding membrane or secreted proteins required for bacterial virulence is not unprecedented , as Yersinia and Shigella spp. extracellularily secrete proteins required for virulence in response to changing environmental conditions ( 6 , 20 ) .
An alteration of the bacterial surface as a result of the change in synthesis of the entire aggregate of proteins mediated by PhoP - PhoQ may be important to S. typhimurium virulence .
This statement may in part be supported by the finding that in this study and our previous work , no strains have been found with single pag mutations that confer sensitivity to defensins or other cationic peptides .
In addition a study by Groisman and colleagues that used protamine sensitivity to randomly screen for genes important to resistance to cationic peptides identified aphoQ mutant but nopag mutants with this phenotype ( 12 ) .
Defensins are small amphipathic cationic peptides of approximately 30 to 35 amino - acids in length whose antimicrobial action involves penetration and disruption of membranes , possibly by forming selective anionic channels ( 18 ) .
Though defensins are largely found in neutrophils and Paneth cells , these or other related molecules likely contribute to nonoxidative killing of phagocytosed bacteria by macrophages .
Though it remains possible that a single unidentified pag locus encodes a protein responsible for defensin resistance , it seems more likely that a cumulative effect of expression of several pag - encoded proteins could result in resistance to defensins .
An aggregate change in a large number of bacterial proteins could alter the membrane charge , electrical potential , or lipid content such that defensin interaction with bacterial membranes could be changed .
In addition to helping define the molecular basis of bacterial virulence in mice , the genes identified here may be useful in the development of live Salmonella vaccines .
Mutations in phoP - activated genes could be used to construct attenuated , live Salmonella vaccines .
Finally , in constructing multivalent Salmonella - vectored vaccines , PhoP - activated promoters could increase immunogenecity by targeting foreign protein expression to antigen - presenting macrophages .
