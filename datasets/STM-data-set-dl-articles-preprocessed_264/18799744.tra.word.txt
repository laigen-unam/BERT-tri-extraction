An example of successful assimilation of virulence traits is Salmonella enterica , which acquired , at distinct evolutionary times , Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) , required for efficient invasion of the intestinal epithelium and intestinal disease , and SPI - 2 , essential for Salmonella replication and survival within macrophages and the progression of a systemic infection .
A positive regulatory cascade mainly composed of HilD , HilA , and InvF , encoded in SPI - 1 , controls the expression of SPI - 1 genes , whereas the two - component regulatory system SsrA/B , encoded in SPI - 2 , controls expression of SPI - 2 genes .
In this study , we report a previously undescribed transcriptional cross - talk between SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 , where the SPI - 1 -- encoded regulator HilD is essential for the activation of both the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons but at different times during the stationary - phase of growth in Luria - Bertani medium .
Our data indicate that HilD counteracts the H - NS -- mediated repression exerted on the OmpRdependent activation of the ssrAB operon by specifically interacting with its regulatory region .
In contrast , HilD is not required for SPI - 2 regulon expression under the in - vitro growth - conditions that are thought to resemble the intracellular environment .
Our results suggest that two independent SPI - 2 activation pathways evolved to take advantage of the SPI - 2 -- encoded information at different niches and , in consequence , in response to different growth conditions .
H - NS OmpR microbial pathogenesis transcriptional regulation salmonella One of the major events in the evolution of pathogenic bacteria has been the horizontal transfer of large DNA fragments , which may encode for a wide variety of virulence factors ( 1 , 2 ) .
Acquisition of pathogenicity islands is a dynamic process that can potentially compromise bacterial fitness if the expression of the newly acquired genes is not appropriately regulated by preexisting regulatory networks .
Recent studies have shown that the histone - like protein H - NS has had an essential role in preventing the uncontrolled expression of A T - rich genes contained within these incoming islands and in allowing the evolution of counteracting regulatory mechanisms to regulate the spatiotemporal expression of the gained genes ( 3 -- 6 ) .
H - NS is a constitutive abundant protein , considered a global transcriptional regulator and a genome - structuring protein , which binds preferentially to A T - rich sequences commonly present in horizontally transferred DNA ( 7 , 8 ) .
Salmonella enterica has evolved through the acquisition of several pathogenicity islands , two of which , Salmonella pathogenicity island ( SPI ) -1 and SPI - 2 , encode type three secretion systems that are essential for virulence ( 9 ) .
These islands are functionally distinct because SPI - 1 genes are required for efficient invasion of the intestinal epithelium , leading to gastroenteritis , whereas SPI - 2 genes are essential for Salmonella replication and survival within macrophages and , as a consequence , for systemic disease ( 9 ) .
With respect to SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 gene regulation , almost all studies have been carried out in - vitro using well - defined synthetic growth media .
Although it is clear that these systems do not reconstitute the in - vivo environment , they have provided valuable insights into the complex regulatory networks involved in virulence gene expression .
The synthetic media used to study SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulation are high - osmolarity and nutrient - rich media , such as Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth ( 10 , 11 ) , and lowphosphate and low - magnesium minimal media , such as N - minimal - medium ( 10 , 12 ) , respectively .
Each of these media is believed to give some approximation of the appropriate in - vivo environment ; the intestinal lumen for SPI - 1 and the intracellular Salmonella - containing vacuole for SPI - 2 .
The SPI - 1 regulon is controlled by a regulatory cascade composed mainly of the SPI - 1 -- encoded regulators HilD , HilA , and InvF ( 13 -- 16 ) .
SPI - 2 genes are expressed when Salmonella is inside host cells ( 17 -- 19 ) and is under the control of the SPI - 2 -- encoded two - component system SsrA/B ( 12 , 20 , 21 ) [ see supporting information ( SI ) Fig .
Here , we developed an in - vitro system to study the sequential activation of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) .
Using this system , we were able to reveal a previously undescribed transcriptional cross - talk mechanism between SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 , where the SPI - 1 -- encoded regulator HilD differentially regulates , in a growth phase - dependent manner , both the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons during - growth in LB - medium .
We show that HilD can bind directly to the regulatory region of the ssrAB operon and counteracts the repression exerted by H - NS on the OmpR - and growth phase - dependent expression of ssrAB .
These results bring to light a new level of sophistication in the regulatory control of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 , which together form the cornerstone of Salmonella virulence .
Additionally , the unveiling of a transcriptional link between a preexistent pathogenicity island and newly acquired genes highlights another important step in the evolution of pathogenic bacteria .
Results Sequential Growth Phase - Dependent Expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 Regulons in LB .

The SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons are expressed in LB in a growth phasedependent manner .
( A ) Kinetics of expression of genes from SPI - 1 ( invF and sopB ) and SPI - 2 ( ssaG and pipB ) regulons as well as hns in LB cultures .
Expression levels of invF - cat , sopB - cat , ssaG - cat , pipB - cat , and hns - cat transcriptional fusions were calculated by determining CAT - specific activity from samples taken hourly from LB cultures of S. typhimurium SL1344 carrying plasmid pinvF - cat1 , psopB - cat1 , pssaG - cat1 , ppipB - cat1 , or phns - cat1 ( Table S1 ) .
The expression of the hns - cat fusion was analyzed as a control , which was not significantly altered along the growth curve .
The data are the average of three different experiments done in duplicate .
The OD 600 at each time point is indicated between parentheses .
Growth phases are indicated by thin bars .
( B ) SsrB , HilA , and OmpR production is also growth phase dependent .
Immunoblots of whole - cell lysates of an S. typhimurium SL1344 strain carrying a chromosomal FLAG - tagged hilA gene grown in LB - medium were performed using a polyclonal anti - SsrB or anti - OmpR antibody or a monoclonal anti - FLAG antibody .
Equivalent amounts of protein were analyzed for each time point .
As a loading control , DnaK was detected using a monoclonal antibody .
regulons , respectively , but are physically located within SPI - 5 ( 22 ) .
We found that both sopB and pipB were expressed in LB , a medium commonly used to study the expression of SPI - 1 genes and not known to support SPI - 2 expression ( 10 , 11 ) , but with different expression profiles .
Whereas sopB expression is activated and maximal following entry into the stationary - phase , activation of pipB was observed at later time points ( Fig. 1A ) .
To test if this sequential activation was a general feature of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons , we also determined the activation kinetics in LB of cat transcriptional - fusions to the SPI - 1 -- encoded invF and the SPI - 2 -- encoded ssaG genes , which followed the same pattern observed for sopB and pipB , respectively ( Fig. 1A ) .
In N - minimal medium , as expected , growth of S. typhimurium carrying these transcriptional - fusions revealed the activation of ssaG - cat and pipB - cat ( SPI - 2 regulon fusions ) but not the SPI - 1 regulon genes invF - cat and sopB - cat ( data not shown ) .
Because the two - component system SsrA/B is critical for the expression of the SPI - 2 regulon in N - minimal - medium ( 12 , 20 , 21 ) , we next asked if it is also essential for expression of ssaG and pipB during the stationary - phase in LB .
Expression of the ssaG and pipB transcriptional - fusions in a ssrB : : kan strain was nearly abolished in either growth medium ( Fig. 2 A and B ) .
In contrast , expression of sopB in LB broth was not affected by the absence of SsrB but was drastically reduced in the absence of HilA ( Fig .
S2 ) , the ToxR/OmpR - like protein that is pivotal for regulation of the SPI - 1 regulon ( 13 -- 15 ) .
To determine whether SsrB and HilA expression in LB was also growth phase dependent , we Fig. 2 .
HilD is required for the stationary growth phase - dependent expression of SPI - 2 regulon genes in LB but not in N - minimal - medium .
Expression of the ssaG - cat and pipB - cat transcriptional - fusions was determined from samples taken from cultures of WT S. typhimurium and its ssrB , SPI - 1 , SPI - 2 , SPI - 5 , hilA , invF , hilD , and hilC derivatives carrying plasmids pssaG - cat1 or ppipB - cat1 grown for 12 h in LB - medium ( A ) or for 16 h in N - minimal medium ( B ) .
The data are the average of three different experiments done in duplicate .
SsrB in WT S. typhimurium and its ompR , hilA , hilC , hilD , and ssrB derivatives was analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti- SsrB antibody and whole - cell lysates prepared from samples taken from LB ( C ) or N - minimal - medium ( D ) cultures at the same time points as in A and B , respectively .
pT3 - HilD ( Table S1 ) was used to complement the hilD mutant .
performed Western blot analysis of whole - cell lysates of strain JPTM7 ( hilA : : 3 FLAG - kan ) obtained from a time course of growth in LB .
JPTM7 is a WT S. typhimurium SL1344 derivative expressing from its chromosomal gene location the HilA protein tagged with a C - terminal 3 FLAG epitope ( HilA - FLAG ) , a feature that did not affect the expression of the SPI - 1 or SPI - 2 regulons ( data not shown ) .
SsrB was detected after 6 h of growth and was more evident toward the late stationary - phase ( Fig. 1B ) , which parallels the activation pattern of ssaG and pipB ( Fig. 1A ) .
Likewise , SsrA production was also growth phase dependent in LB ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , HilA was detected after the first 2hattheonset of the stationary - phase , reaching maximal levels between 4 and 6 h and declining during the late stationary phase ( Fig. 1B ) , resembling the expression patterns of invF and sopB ( Fig. 1A ) .
Therefore , the growth phase - dependent expression of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulon genes can be attributed to mechanisms regulating the expression of their respective central regulators , HilA and SsrB .
These results revealed that Salmonella senses two different environmental conditions during - growth in LB , which allows the sequential activation of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons at different stages during the stationary - phase .
Thus , the stationary - phase of growth in LB offers a condition where the transcriptional transition between these two regulons can be analyzed ( SPI - 1 turning off and SPI - 2 turning on ) .
The SPI - 1 -- Encoded Regulator HilD Also Regulates the SPI - 2 Regulon .
To dissect the mechanism of activation of the SPI - 2 regulon during the stationary - phase in LB , we explored the potential role of the stationary - phase factor RpoS as well as that of genes related to quorum - sensing systems , such as luxS , which codes for the enzyme that generates an autoinducer 2 - like signal , and sdiA , which codes for a LuxR - like protein ( 23 ) .
Mutants lacking rpoS , luxS , orsdiA showed no defect in SPI - 2 gene expression ( data not shown ) , indicating that regulatory proteins acting primarily in response to population density are not involved in this activation 14592 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas .0801205105 Bustamante et al. pathway .
Furthermore , acidic pH , believed to be a major inducing signal for SPI - 2 expression in minimal - medium and within the Salmonella - containing vacuole ( 12 , 19 , 21 , 24 -- 26 ) did not induce SPI - 2 ; indeed , acidification of the medium had an adverse effect on SPI - 2 expression ( data not shown ) .
We additionally showed that the stringent signal - molecule ppGpp is required for the stationary - phase induction of both the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons but does not control the transition from SPI - 1 to SPI - 2 expression in LB ( SI Results and Fig .
We next looked at the possible involvement of elements encoded within the SPI - 1 , SPI - 2 , and SPI - 5 pathogenicity islands by analyzing the expression of the ssaG - cat and pipB - cat transcriptional fusions in S. typhimurium SPI - 1 , SPI - 2 , and SPI - 5 derivatives .
As expected , expression of ssaG - cat and pipB - cat fusions in the SPI - 2 deletion mutant was drastically reduced during the stationary - phase in LB ; intriguingly , it was similarly reduced in the SPI - 1 deletion mutant but not in the SPI - 5 mutant ( Fig. 2A ) .
Thus , induction of the SPI - 2 regulon during the stationary - phase in LB requires an SPI - 1 -- encoded factor .
To determine if this involves any of the known SPI - 1 -- encoded regulatory proteins , we next analyzed the expression of the ssaG - cat and pipB - cat transcriptional - fusions in mutants lacking HilD ( hilD ) , HilC ( hilC ) , HilA ( hilA ) , or InvF ( invF ) .
Interestingly , only the hilD mutant showed reduced levels of expression of both fusions ( Fig. 2A ) , and this was specific for these growth - conditions because their expression was unaffected in the hilD mutant following growth in N - minimal - medium ( Fig. 2B ) .
As expected , expression of the SPI - 1 regulon sopB - cat fusion was abolished in the hilD , hilA , and invF mutants but was not affected in the hilC and ssrB mutants during - growth in LB ( Fig .
To determine whether HilD regulates the SPI - 2 regulon by controlling the expression of the two - component system SsrA/B , SsrA and SsrB protein levels were analyzed by immunoblotting of Salmonella lysates after growth in LB to the stationary - phase .
SsrB was detected directly using an anti - SsrB antibody , but an epitope tagged SsrA had to be constructed to assess SsrA expression .
For this , the chromosomal ssrA gene was engineered to express a C - terminal 3 FLAG tag , generating strain JPTM9 .
This strain was then transferred by P22 transduction to ompR , hilA , hilC , and hilD deletion backgrounds , generating strains JPTM10 , JPTM11 , JPTM12 , and JPTM13 , respectively .
SsrB levels in the hilA and hilC strains were similar to WT , but the SsrB level was barely detected in the hilD mutant unless this strain was complemented with a plasmid expressing HilD ( Fig. 2C ) .
In contrast , SsrB production was not affected in the hilD mutant when grown in N - minimal - medium ( Fig. 2D ) .
These results confirm the role of HilD in the regulation of the SPI - 2 regulon during - growth in LB .
Analysis of SsrA - FLAG levels gave similar results to SsrB ( Fig .
S4 ) , indicating that HilD controls both the sensor kinase and the response regulator during the stationary - phase of growth in LB cultures .
Several studies have addressed the role of the response regulators OmpR and PhoP in the expression of ssrAB and SPI - 2 regulon genes in Salmonella grown in low Mg 2 minimal - medium or within infected epithelial or macrophage cell lines ( 24 , 27 , 28 ) .
To assess the role of these regulators in the growth phasedependent activation of SsrA and SsrB production in LB , their levels were analyzed by immunoblotting using total cell lysates of the ompR and phoP mutants grown in LB and in N - minimal medium .
This analysis showed that OmpR but not PhoP was required for SsrA and SsrB expression under both growth conditions ( Fig. 2 C and D , Fig .
S4 , and data not shown ) .
Interestingly , OmpR also accumulated over time , reaching maximal levels during the late stationary - phase in LB , as revealed by immunoblotting of samples from the time course of growth shown in Fig. 1B .
This observation suggests that the specific HilD - dependent activation of SPI - 2 expression in LB could , at Fig. 3 .
HilD positively regulates ssrA and ssrB expression by counteracting H - NS .
H - NS was inactivated in S. typhimurium ssrA : : 3 FLAG hilD : : kan and ssrA : : 3 FLAG ompR : : kan mutants by expressing a dominant - negative C - terminal truncated form of H - NS ( see text ) .
Plasmids pT6 - HNS - WT and pT6 - HNS - Q92am direct the expression of WT H - NS and H - NS Q92am , respectively , from an arabinose - inducible promoter .
Strains were grown in LB - medium , with or without 0.1 % arabinose .
SsrA - FLAG and SsrB were detected by immunoblot analysis of whole - cell lysates using a monoclonal anti - FLAG antibody or polyclonal anti - SsrB antibodies .
DnaK levels were also determined as a loading control using a monoclonal antibody .
least in part , be modulated by the growth phase - dependent expression of other essential regulatory proteins , such as OmpR .
HilD Counteracts the Repression Exerted by H - NS on ssrAB .
HilD has been previously shown to regulate the expression of hilA , the gene coding for the central positive regulator of the SPI - 1 regulon , positively by counteracting the H - NS -- mediated repression on the hilA promoter ( 29 , 30 ) .
Furthermore , it has also been shown that expression of the ssrAB genes is thermoregulated by H - NS ( 31 ) .
These results are consistent with two recent reports documenting the role of H - NS in silencing the expression of genes that have been acquired by Salmonella through horizontal gene transfer , such as those belonging to the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons ( 3 , 4 ) .
Based on these antecedents , we next examined whether HilD induces expression of the SPI - 2 regulon by counteracting H - NS repression .
Because Salmonella lacking hns shows severe growth defects and seems to be viable only after acquiring secondary mutations ( 4 ) , we used an H - NS mutant that does not have DNA - binding activity but still forms heterodimers with WT monomers , and thus acts as a dominant negative mutant ( 32 , 33 ) .
Plasmids encoding WT H - NS ( pT6 - HNS - WT ) or the H - NS/Q92am mutant ( pT6 - HNS - Q92am ) , a C - terminal truncated H - NS derivative corresponding to the N - terminal dimerization domain ( H - NS Q92am ) , under the control of an arabinose - inducible promoter , were transformed into strains ssrA : : 3xFLAG ompR : : kan ( JPTM10 ) and ssrA : : 3xFLAG hilD : : kan ( JPTM13 ) , which were then grown in LB in the presence or absence of 0.1 % arabinose .
Total lysates prepared from samples collected during the stationary - phase of growth in LB were subjected to immunoblotting using anti - FLAG and anti - SsrB antibodies .
As shown in Fig. 3 , SsrA - FLAG and SsrB were not detected in the hilD strain carrying pT6 - HNS - WT with or without arabinose ; however , induction of the dominantnegative H - NS Q92am from plasmid pT6 - HNS - Q92am restored SsrA - FLAG and SsrB levels in the hilD mutant .
Interestingly , the H - NS Q92am dominant negative did not restore SsrA - FLAG or SsrB production in the ompR mutant ( Fig. 3 ) .
These results indicated that HilD counteracts the H - NS -- mediated repression on the ssrAB operon , subsequently allowing OmpR to activate transcription .
HilD and H - NS Directly Interact with the ssrAB Regulatory Region .
Consistently with the coordinated production of both SsrA and SsrB described previously , we also found that the ssrAB genes are transcribed as an operon in an HilD - and OmpR - dependent MICROBIOLOGY Bustamante et al. .
HilD and H - NS directly interact with the ssrAB regulatory region .
EMSAs were performed to analyze HilD and H - NS binding to the ssrAB and hilA regulatory regions .
Fragments encompassing the regulatory regions of hilA ( 410 to 446 ) , sopB ( 400 to 128 ) and ssrAB ( 300 to 478 ) , with respect to the corresponding transcriptional start sites , were incubated with increasing concentrations of affinity - purified MBP - HilD ( 0 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 M ) or H - NS - His 6 ( 0 , 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.6 , and 0.7 M ) .
The DNA - protein complexes ( indicated by an asterisk ) were resolved in 6 % polyacrylamide gels and stained with ethidium bromide .
The hilA and sopB fragments were used as positive and negative controls , respectively .
manner from the promoter located upstream of ssrA ( SI Results and Fig .
Having shown that HilD and H - NS regulate ssrAB , we next asked whether this is mediated by direct interaction of these proteins with the regulatory region of ssrAB , analogous to HilD and H - NS regulation of hilA ( 29 , 30 , 34 ) .
Affinity - purified maltose - binding protein ( MBP ) - HilD and H - NS - His 6 were then used to perform electrophoretic - mobility - shift assays ( EMSAs ) with fragments encompassing different regulatory regions .
In agreement with other reports ( 30 , 34 , 35 ) , MBP - HilD shifted specifically DNA fragments containing the regulatory regions of hilA or hilD at a concentration of 0.1 M ( Fig. 4A and Fig .
S6A ) but not those of the negative controls sopB ( present in the same reaction ) and sirA even at the highest concentration tested ( 0.4 M ) ( Fig. 4 A and B and Fig .
S6B ) , indicating that the purified MBP - HilD was functional in - vitro and binds specifically .
In agreement with our transcriptional - fusion data showing its role as a positive regulator of the ssrAB operon , MBP - HilD also specifically shifted the ssrAB promoter fragment at concentrations 0.3 M ( Fig. 4B ) .
Therefore , HilD directly interacts with the regulatory region of the ssrAB operon .
Likewise , H - NS - His 6 specifically bound to the fragments containing the hilA or hilD regulatory region ( Fig. 4C and Fig .
S6C ) as well as to the ssrAB promoter fragment at concentrations 0.3 M ( Fig. 4D ) , indicating that it directly silences this promoter .
Discussion Acquisition of genomic DNA through horizontal gene transfer events could potentially impose a competitive disadvantage to the new bacterial host .
Recent reports have highlighted the role that H - NS has played in bacterial evolution by silencing or downregulating , at the transcriptional level , the expression of foreign genes that have been acquired as a result of horizontal gene transfer events , thus preventing disadvantageous effects to the new bacterial host ( 3 , 4 , 6 , 36 ) .
Bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella have evolved as a consequence of multiple horizontal gene transfer events at different evolutionary time points .
Most of the genes acquired through these events are subjected to H - NS silencing ; thus , regulatory mechanisms that alleviate this repression also evolved to induce the expression of the gained genes at particular host niches ( 3 , 4 , 6 , 36 ) .
Recent observations have suggested that the expression of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes and their role at distinct steps during the infection process are not as independent and niche restricted as previously thought .
For example , SPI - 1 genes have also been shown to be important for Salmonella persistence during longterm systemic infections , phagosome maturation , and intracellular proliferation ( 37 -- 39 ) , and SPI - 2 genes have been implicated in intestinal colonization , persistence during the intestinal phase , and induction of secretory and inflammatory responses ( 40 -- 43 ) .
Furthermore , recent reports have suggested that expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons is not restricted to unique and independent niches .
SPI - 2 -- encoded genes can be expressed in the intestinal lumen before penetration of the intestinal epithelium ( 44 ) , whereas SPI - 1 effectors can be detected in infected mice many days after infection ( 45 ) or induced intracellularly following phagocytic uptake but not following SPI - 1 -- mediated invasion ( 19 , 46 ) .
Here , we describe a simple method whereby SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons can be induced sequentially in LB - medium , thus providing a unique opportunity to examine the mechanism of switching from SPI - 1 to SPI - 2 induction .
Growth of Salmonella in LB has generally been considered to induce expression of the SPI - 1 regulon and , conversely , to repress SPI - 2 expression ( 10 , 11 ) .
Although expression of SPI - 2 genes has been previously observed in LB ( 47 , 48 ) , the mechanism involved in their activation has not been investigated .
Our data show that SPI - 2 genes are activated in LB in a growth phase - dependent manner once the bacteria have reached the late stationary - phase and SPI - 1 expression has ceased .
Under these growth - conditions , expression of SPI - 2 genes requires the SsrA/B two - component regulatory system , whose essential role in SPI - 2 regulon activation has been well documented in - vitro and in - vivo ( 12 , 20 , 21 , 49 , 50 ) .
In addition , we show that the regulatory pathway activating the SPI - 2 regulon in response to stationary growth phase conditions specifically involves the SPI - 1 -- encoded regulator HilD , which also has a hierarchical regulatory function in the activation of the SPI - 1 regulon as well as a key role in - vivo ( 51 ) .
Therefore , HilD appears to be at the center of a regulatory network that connects both SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 gene expression .
The critical question now is how can HilD differentially activate SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 expression at different growth stages in the same growth medium ?
In theory the mechanism could depend on a number of different factors : the higher affinity that HilD shows for the hilA promoter region versus the ssrAB regulatory region ; the parallel growth phase - dependent expression of other key SPI - 2 regulators such as OmpR ; the competitive action of a negative regulatory mechanism turning off SPI - 1 expression , thus redirecting HilD toward ssrAB activation ; and other possibilities that have not yet been investigated .
Analysis of different Salmonella genomes has shed light on the evolution of the Salmonella genus and suggested that SPI - 2 is a more recently acquired virulence trait because it is not present in the phylogenetically older species S. bongori ( 52 , 53 ) .
In this context , it is tempting to speculate that acquisition of SPI - 2 imposed a need to coordinate its expression with preexistent virulence traits so as not to compromise bacterial fitness and efficiency to ensure the successful exploitation of different host niches .
In this regard , we have shown that HilD directly binds the regulatory region of ssrAB and acts as an H - NS antagonist to allow the OmpR - dependent activation of this operon , which is consistent with its reported function in the activation of hilA ( 29 , 30 , 54 ) .
Adaptation of HilD to antagonize H - NS -- dependent repression on the ssrAB operon , establishing a transcriptional cross - talk between the previously acquired SPI - 1 and the incoming SPI - 2 , would ensure the coordinated and successive 14594 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas .0801205105 Bustamante et al. expression of both regulons under different conditions or host niches , leading to the successful evolution of Salmonella as an enteric and facultative intracellular pathogen .
Considering the pleiotropic effects of HilD on the regulation of Salmonella virulence - factors , dissecting the role of HilDmediated activation of SPI - 2 regulon expression at different stages of an infection or in different hosts will require the precise definition of the ssrAB cis - acting elements in which HilD binds to exert its H - NS antagonistic function .
The modification of this site at the chromosomal level to prevent HilD binding without affecting H - NS repression or ssrAB activation through HilDindependent pathways , such as those acting in N - minimal - medium , will provide a strategy to generate Salmonella strains in which the HilD - mediated activation of the SPI - 1 regulon remains functional .
These strains could then be tested in different in - vitro conditions and infection models to define the role of HilD more clearly in regulating the SPI - 2 regulon .
In summary , by revealing the existence of an SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 transcriptional cross - talk mechanism , this work has disclosed a new level of complexity in the already intricate regulatory networks of Salmonella virulence ( Fig .
HilD seems to coordinate the expression of both regulons in response to changing conditions that may be encountered at different stages during the progression of an infection .
Once the bacterium has initiated the program that controls expression of the SPI - 1 regulon in the gut lumen , the presence of HilD would help to set the activation of the SPI - 2 regulon to perform , for example , its role during the enteric phase of the infection .
Inside macrophages , expression of SPI - 2 probably relies entirely on the PhoP/SlyA - dependent pathway , consistent with our observations that suggest these two pathways are not likely to overlap in - vivo , because they are independently active under different growth conditions , and are apparently not synergistic , because each of them is active in the absence of the other .
Regulation of the SPI - 2 regulon is an example of the complexity of regulatory mechanisms that have evolved by integrating ancestral ( e.g. , H - NS , OmpR , PhoP ) , previously acquired ( e.g. , HilD ) , and accompanying ( e.g. , SsrB ) regulatory elements into a complex regulatory network , which allows the spatiotemporal and coordinated expression of virulence - factors during the infectious process .
Materials and Methods Strains , Plasmids , and Primers .
Bacterial strains , plasmids , and primers used in this study are listed in Tables S1 and S2 .
Mutant strains were generated by the Red recombinase system , as reported previously ( 55 , 56 ) , and as briefly described in SI Materials and Methods .
Construction of plasmids is also described in detail in SI Materials and Methods .
LB - medium containing 1 % tryptone , 0.5 % yeast extract , and 1 % NaCl at pH 7.5 or N - minimal - medium containing 5 mM KCl , 7.5 mM ( NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.5 mM K 2 SO 4 ,1 mMKH 2 PO 4 , 100 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , 10 M MgCl 2 , 0.5 % glycerol , and 0.1 % casamino - acids was used for growth of bacterial cultures .
Bacterial suspensions were prepared from overnight LB cultures that were concentrated and resuspended in fresh LB or N - minimal medium to an OD 600 of 1 .
Then , 250 - ml flasks containing 50 ml of LB or N - minimal - medium were inoculated with a 50 - fold dilution of the bacterial suspensions and incubated at 37 °C in a shaken water bath at 200 rpm .
Samples used to determine chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ( CAT ) activity or for Western blot analysis were taken hourly or at specific time points as indicated in the figure legends .
For the H - NS dominant - negative assay , duplicate LB cultures of the strains containing plasmid pMPM - T6 , pT6 - HNS - WT , or pT6 - HNS - Q92am were initiated as described previously .
Two hours later , 0.1 % L - ( ) - arabinose ( Sigma ) was added to one duplicate to induce the expression of WT H - NS or the dominant - negative H - NS Q92am protein .
Samples for Western blot analysis were taken 8 h after arabinose induction .
Immunoblots were performed as described in SI Materials and Methods using anti - SsrB or anti - OmpR polyclonal antibodies and anti- FLAG M2 ( Sigma ) or anti - DnaK ( StressGen ) monoclonal antibodies at 1:10,000 , 1:2,000 , 1:1,000 , and 1:20,000 dilutions , respectively .
Expression and Purification of MBP - HilD and H - NS - His 6 .
MBP - HilD or H - NS - His 6 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21/pLys containing pMAL - HilD1 or pT6 - HNS - His 6 and purified from a soluble extract loaded into an amylose column by eluting with column buffer containing 10 mM maltose ( Bioxon ) or by using a HiTrap Ni 2 - chelating column , as described in SI Materials and Methods .
Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford procedure .
EMSAs were performed as follows .
PCR fragments encompassing the regulatory regions of ssrAB , hilA , hilD , sopB , and sirA were amplified using primer pairs ssaBFBglII/ssrBRS6E , hilA1FBamHI/hilA2RHindIII , hilDFBamHI / hilDRHindIII , sigDH3R/sigDBH1F , and sirAFBamHI/sirARHindIII , respectively ( Table S2 ) , and S. typhimurium SL1344 chromosomal DNA as a template .
Each PCR product ( 100 ng ) was mixed with increasing concentrations of purified MBP - HilD or H - NS - His 6 in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8.0 ) , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 0.5 mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol , and 10 g ml 1 BSA in a final volume of 20 l .
The reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then electrophoretically separated in 6 % polyacrylamide nondenaturing gels in 0.5 Tris - borate - EDTA buffer at room temperature .
The DNA fragments were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized with an Alpha - Imager UV transilluminator ( Alpha Innotech Corp. ) .
The CAT assays and protein quantification to calculate CATspecific activities were performed as described previously ( 57 ) .
