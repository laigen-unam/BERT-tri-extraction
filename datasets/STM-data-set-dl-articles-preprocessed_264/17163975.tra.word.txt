Summary The RNA chaperone , Hfq , plays a diverse role in bacterial physiology beyond its original role as a host factor required for replication of Qb RNA bacteriophage .
In this study , we show that Hfq is involved in the expression and secretion of virulence - factors in the facultative intracellular pathogen , Salmonella typhimurium .
ASalmonella hfq deletion strain is highly attenuated in mice after both oral and intraperitoneal infection , and shows a severe defect in invasion of epithelial cells and a growth defect in both epithelial cells and macrophages in - vitro .
Surprisingly , we find that these phenotypes are largely independent of the previously reported requirement of Hfq for expression of the stationary - phase sigma factor , RpoS .
Our results implicate Hfq as a key regulator of multiple aspects of virulence including regulation of motility and outer membrane protein ( OmpD ) expression in addition to invasion and intracellular growth .
These pleiotropic effects are suggested to involve a network of regulatory small non - coding RNAs , placing Hfq at the centre of post - transcriptional regulation of virulence gene expression in Salmonella.Inaddition , the hfq mutation appears to cause a chronic activation of the RpoEmediated envelope stress response which is likely due to a misregulation of membrane protein expression .

gene expression ( Valentin - Hansen et al. , 2004 ) .
Hfq was first identified in Escherichia coli as a host factor required for replication of Qb RNA bacteriophage ( Franze de Fernandez et al. , 1968 ) , and shown to be an RNA - binding protein that forms homohexamers of ~ 12 kDa subunits ( Franze de Fernandez et al. , 1972 ) .
Hfq was early observed to be an abundant protein ( Carmichael et al. , 1975 ) , but its importance in uninfected bacteria remained unclear until it was shown that an hfq insertion mutant of E. coli exhibited broad , pleiotropic phenotypes affecting growth - rate , cell morphology and tolerance of stress conditions ( Tsui et al. , 1994 ) .
Independently , genetic analysis of Azorhizobium caulinodans and Yersinia enterocolitica mutants , showing defects in nitrogen fixation or toxin production respectively , found that these phenotypes were due to mutations in hfq ( Kaminski et al. , 1994 ; Nakao et al. , 1995 ) .
Subsequently , Hfq was shown to promote efficient translation of rpoS mRNA in E. coli and Salmonella ( Brown and Elliott , 1996 ; Muffler et al. , 1996 ) , and to alter the stability of several other mRNAs ( e.g. Vytvytska et al. , 1998 ; Hajnsdorf and Regnier , 2000 ) , indicating that this protein acts to regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level .
Hfq has also emerged as a key player in mRNA translational control by small non - coding RNAs ( sRNAs ) .
Here , Hfq was first observed to be involved in translational repression of rpoS mRNA by OxyS , a small regulatory RNA that is part of the oxidative stress response in E. coli ( Zhang et al. , 1998 ) .
Since then , numerous E. coli sRNAs have been shown to associate with Hfq and to require this protein for their own stability and/or for interactions with their target mRNAs ( reviewed in Valentin - Hansen et al. , 2004 ; Majdalani et al. , 2005 ; Romby et al. , 2006 ) .
These include two E. coli sRNAs , DsrA and RprA , which activate rpoS translation in response to stress conditions ( reviewed in Repoila et al. , 2003 ) ; note , however , that the RpoS regulatory function of these sRNAs may not be conserved in Salmonella ( Jones et al. , 2006 ) .
Several recent studies addressed a potential role of Hfq in the virulence of pathogenic bacteria .
A Brucella abortus hfq mutant displayed significantly reduced survival in cultured murine macrophages , and attenuated virulence in a mouse model ( Robertson and Roop , 1999 ) .
Similarly , Hfq was reported to be essential for the virulence of Vibrio cholerae ( Ding et al. , 2004 ) .
An hfq Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd 194 A. Sittka , V. Pfeiffer , K. Tedin and J. Vogel mutant of this bacterium fails to colonize the suckling mouse intestine , a model of cholera pathogenesis .
Hfq also contributes to the pathogenesis of Listeria monocytogenes in mice ( Christiansen et al. , 2004 ) , and to Legionella pneumophila virulence in amoeba and macrophage infection models ( McNealy et al. , 2005 ) .
Furthermore , the hfq mutation reduces the virulence of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa by affecting both cell - associated ( flagellum , adhesion factors ) as well as extracellular virulence factors , e.g. elastases and pyocyanin ( Sonnleitner et al. , 2003 ) .
In most of these cases , the observed virulence defects were accompanied by reduced stress tolerance , likely reflecting a compromised ability to cope with the harsh environment in the host cell ( Robertson and Roop , 1999 ; Christiansen et al. , 2004 ; McNealy et al. , 2005 ) .
A role for Hfq in bacterial virulence was first indicated by its requirement for efficient expression of the major stress sigma factor , s S ( also known as RpoS , KatF or s 38 ) inthe enteric bacteria , E. coli and Salmonella .
Here , hfq mutants display greatly reduced RpoS levels in stationary phase , due to inefficient translation of the rpoS mRNA ( Brown and Elliott , 1996 ; Muffler et al. , 1996 ) .
In Salmonella , s S is an important virulence factor as it mediates the expression of the Salmonella plasmid virulence ( spv ) genes , which are required for systemic infection , and enables bacteria to cope with diverse stresses ( nutrient deprivation , oxidative and acid stress , DNA damage ) relevant to the environments faced in their mammalian hosts ( Fang et al. , 1992 ; Bang et al. , 2005 ) .
A Salmonella rpoS mutant exhibits significantly reduced virulence in mice ( Fang et al. , 1992 ) , and mutated rpoS alleles are often found in attenuated Salmonella strains ( Robbe - Saule et al. , 1995 ; Wilmes - Riesenberg et al. , 1997 ) .
Based on the importance of Hfq for s S expression and the many phenotypes shared by hfq and rpoS mutants in E. coli and Salmonella ( Fang et al. 1992 ; Muffler et al. , 1997 ) , it has generally been assumed that Hfq would be important for Salmonella virulence .
However , experimental evidence for a more general role of Hfq , i.e. beyond promoting rpoS mRNA translation , has so far been lacking .
To address these questions , we constructed and characterized a set of hfq mutants and control strains in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) .
We find that loss of Hfq results in drastically reduced virulence in - vitro and in - vivo .
These phenotypes , which are largely s S - independent , are associated with loss of cell motility , altered membrane composition , reduced adhesion and abrogated effector protein secretion .
The results indicate that Hfq plays a much more dominant role in Salmonella virulence than previously believed .
Results Construction of Salmonella hfq mutant and control strains The hfq gene is located in clockwise orientation at bps 4604575 -- 4604883 in the genome of S. typhimurium strain LT2 ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) .
As in E. coli , it is located in the yjeF - yjeE - amiB - mutL - miaA - hfq - hflX - hflKhflC cluster of genes ( Fig. 1A ) , part of which may form an operon ( Tsui and Winkler , 1994 ) .
The Salmonella and E. coli hfq genes are 93 % and 94 % identical at the nucleotide and amino - acid level respectively , with all amino - acid deviations being located in the Hfq C - terminal region ( Brown and Elliott , 1996 ) .
The sequence of the hfq region taken from the unfinished genome of the virulent Salmonella strain used in this study , SL1344 ( http://www.sanger .
ac.uk / Projects/Salmonella ) , was compared with that of strain LT2 and found to be identical .
Based on the sequence data , three hfq mutant or control strains were constructed in SL1344 to study Hfq functions in - vivo ( Fig. 1B ) .
In the Dhfq mutant , the entire hfq coding region is replaced by a cat ( chloramphenicol resistance ) marker .
As the cat gene used here does not carry a transcriptional terminator , transcription of the polycistron should be unaffected .
hfq - C is a control strain in which the cat gene is inserted after the hfq stop codon .
In control strain hfq HIS , the cat gene is inserted before the UAA stop codon .
In addition , this latter insertion adds six histidine codons to the last hfq codon , thus producing a chromosomally encoded His - tagged Hfq protein .
Growth characteristics of the hfq mutant and control strains All three hfq strains formed normal colonies when grown on standard Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) plates at 37 °C , although the Dhfq strain exhibited slightly slower growth .
At room temperature ( 22 °C ) however , the Dhfq mutant grew much more slowly than the wild type , seen as a smaller colony size , whereas the hfq - C and hfq HIS derivatives showed normal growth ( data not shown ) .
When we compared the growth of all strains in LB liquid medium with aeration at 37 °C , no differences were observed among the wild type , and the two control strains , hfq - C and hfq HIS ( Fig. 1C ) .
The deletion mutant , Dhfq , showed a longer lag phase after inoculation into fresh medium and reached stationary phase at a lower optical density as compared with the other three strains .
However , parallel determination of viable counts at three different growth phases showed that cell viability of Dhfq was uncompromised ( Fig. 1D ) .
The observation that the hfq - C and hfq HIS strains showed growth - rates identical to the wild - type strain supported the suggestion that the slightly altered growth of the Dhfq mutant was due to the lack of Hfq protein rather Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 63 , 193 -- 217 Hfq functions in Salmonella 195 Fig. 1 .

than to polar effects caused by the insertion of the cat cassette .
To corroborate this , the hfq HIS allele including 1014 bp of the upstream miaA coding sequence was cloned in a low - copy vector ( pSC101 * origin ) , resulting in plasmid pStHfq - 6H .
This plasmid fully complemented the reduced growth of the Dhfq strain ( Fig. 1E ) , also indicating that the major hfq promoter is located within the miaA coding region .

The Dhfq mutant is severely attenuated in mice .
A. Groups of five Balb/c mice were infected perorally with suspensions of ~ 10 8 bacteria of either the wild - type or Dhfq strains .
Bacterial loads in spleen homogenates were determined 72 h post infection .
For intraperitoneal infections ( B ) 1:1 mixtures of both , wild - type and Dhfq strain , each strain at ~ 10 5 bacteria , were used for infections .
Forty - eight hours post infection , spleens were removed and the cfu ml -1 for each strain was determined in spleen homogenates by plating to selective plates for calculation of the relative ratios of the two , co - infecting strains ( competitive index , CI , see text ) .
genicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) - inducing conditions were used extensively in this study ( see below ) , we also determined the growth behaviour of all aforementioned strains under these conditions .
As seen with aerobic - growth , the Dhfq mutant strain exhibited a slightly extended lag phase but reached the same optical density as the wild type while the two control strains hfq HIS and hfq - C show growth indistinguishable from the wild - type strain ( Fig .
The hfq mutation attenuates virulence in mice To address the role of Hfq in Salmonella pathogenesis , we first examined the effect of the hfq deletion in a typhoid fever mouse model of Salmonella infection .
Groups of 4 - to 5 - week - old , female Balb/c mice ( five mice per strain ) were infected perorally with 10 8 cfu of either the wild - type or Dhfq strains .
Mice infected with the wild - type strain showed typical symptoms of infection beginning the following day , whereas mice infected with the Dhfq mutant showed no signs of illness during the course of the experiment .
The infected animals were sacrificed 72 h post infection , and organ colonization was determined by plating dilutions of homogenized spleen lysates to agar plates .
As shown in Fig. 2A , the hfq mutant was recovered at > 100 - fold reduced levels relative to the wild - type strain after peroral infection , and for at least two of the mice , no bacteria were recovered .
These observations suggested that the hfq mutation resulted in defects in either invasion of intestinal epithelial cells , macrophage survival , or both .
To determine whether the virulence defect of the hfq mutant extended beyond invasion - related defects , mice were also co - infected intraperitoneally with a mixture of the wild - type and Dhfq strains , where uptake by resident macrophages should circumvent the need for invasion .
Two , independent experiments indicated that the hfq mutant showed at least a 30 - to 100 - fold reduced uptake and/or survival in macrophages and subsequent carriage to the spleen compared with the wild - type strain ( Fig. 2B ) , leading to calculated competitive indices ( CI ; Shea et al. , 1999 ) of 0.01 -- 0.03 .
This is consistent with the idea that both uptake and intracellular survival/proliferation in macrophages were affected .
It should be noted that the postinfection time points for determination of bacterial counts shown were chosen to avoid premature death of the infected animals .
In preliminary experiments , in animals still surviving 1 week post infection in the mixed infection experiments , the Dhfq strain showed a > 1000 - fold reduction in cfu relative to the wild - type strain ( CI of 0.0005 - 0.001 ; data not shown ) .
The hfq mutant is impaired in the invasion of non - phagocytic cells Oral infection by Salmonella results in active invasion of non - phagocytic epithelial cells of the host intestine .
To Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 63 , 193 -- 217 Hfq functions in Salmonella 197 determine the effect of the hfq mutation on the invasion rate of non - phagocytic cells in - vitro , cultured HeLa cells were infected with the wild - type and several hfq mutant and control strain strains .
A Salmonella SL1344 Dspi1 mutant , which lacks the entire SPI1 , served as a negative control in these experiments .
SPI1 encodes a type three secretion system ( TTSS ) and several effector proteins that mediate the uptake of Salmonella by non - phagocytic eukaryotic cells ( Galan and Curtiss , 1989 ; Mills et al. , 1995 ; Collazo and Galan , 1996 ) .
HeLa cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 10 with bacteria grown aerobically to early stationary - phase ( OD 600 of 2 ) .
Following gentamicin treatment to kill remaining extracellular bacteria , the number of intracellular bacteria was determined 2 and 6 h post infection ( Table 1 ) .
The hfq deletion mutant showed a 100 - fold reduced initial rate of invasion at 2 h post infection compared with the wild - type strain .
We also compared the number of intracellular bacteria present after an additional 4 h. Within these 4 h , the number of wild - type bacteria doubled , whereas the number of hfq mutant bacteria remained unchanged , suggesting an intracellular growth defect in addition to an invasion defect .
Despite its drastic invasion defect , the invasion rate of the hfq mutant remains above that of a non - invasive Dspi1 mutant for which only single cells could be recovered ( Table 1 and Fig .
To determine whether the hfq mutant was still impaired in invasion when grown under SPI1 - inducing conditions , the invasion assays were repeated with bacterial cultures grown for 12 h under high - salt , oxygen - limiting conditions ( Table 1 and Fig .
These growth - conditions increased the invasion rate of both the wild type and the Dhfq strain to 30 % and 3 % respectively ( as calculated for the 2 h time point ) .
However , the Dhfq strain remained 10 - fold less invasive than the wild type , and intermediate with respect to the non - invasive Dspi1 mutant .
While the wild - type strain showed more than one replication in additional 4 h , the Dhfq strain only doubled in the 4 h period .
Three other strains included as controls in all of these experiments , DrpoS , hfq - C and hfq HIS , all displayed only slightly reduced invasion rates in the range of 1.3 - to threefold in comparison with the wild type , and none of these strains were affected in intracellular growth ( Table 1 and Fig .
To corroborate that the lack of Hfq protein was the main cause of the invasion defect of the Dhfq mutant , we tested whether it could be complemented by a plasmid - borne hfq allele .
Providing Hfq in trans with plasmid pStHfq - 6H not only fully restored invasion to the hfq deletion strain , but enhanced invasion relative to the wild type ( Table 1 and Fig .
Taken together , these data suggest that Hfq is required for efficient invasion of non - phagocytic cells , which is likely to underlie the strong attenuation of virulence seen in oral mouse infections .

Sittka , V. Pfeiffer , K. Tedin and J. Vogel We also examined both the invasion and long - term intracellular growth phenotypes of the Dhfq mutant in an intestinal epithelial cell line ( Fig .
Consistent with the results using the HeLa cell line , the initial invasion rate of LoVo cells was 10 - to 100 - fold reduced at either a 10 - fold higher or equivalent infective dose as the wild - type strain respectively .
In addition , whereas the wild - type strain showed an approximately 10 - to 20 - fold increase in intracellular cfu over a 24 h period , the Dhfq strain showed either no change or a slight reduction in viable bacteria over the same period .
These results were consistent with a requirement for Hfq for both invasion as well as intracellular replication in non - phagocytic cells .
The hfq strain survives but shows an intracellular growth defect in macrophages Salmonella survival in the host is also dependent on the ability to survive and replicate in macrophages .
To test a possible role for Hfq in macrophage survival , we infected in - vitro cultured murine macrophages ( RawB ) with equal numbers of wild - type and hfq mutant bacteria ( Table 1 and Fig .
At 1 h post infection , we noted 30 - fold fewer intracellular bacteria in macrophages infected with the hfq mutant , likely reflecting the reduced invasion rate of this strain .
However , complementation with plasmid pStHfq - 6H fully restored macrophage invasion , comparable to levels observed with wild - type bacteria .
Intracellular replication as determined 4 and 24 h after infection also revealed drastic differences between the wild - type strain and the hfq deletion mutant .
While the wild - type and the hfq - C and hfq HIS control strains at least doubled within the 4 h post infection , the hfq deletion mutant showed no significant increase in intracellular bacteria per macrophage .
At 24 h post infection the number of intracellular bacteria had increased to > threefold as compared with the 1 h time point for the wild - type , the control strains and the complemented deletion mutant ( Table 1 ) .
In other experiments , infection of the J774A .1 murine macrophage cell line showed a similar reduction in initial uptake , but no significant increase in intracellular cfu for up to 24 h ( Fig .
Thus , Hfq appeared to have little or no effect on the expression of genes required for macrophage survival , although the lack of significant intracellular growth in both epithelial and macrophage cell lines suggested an effect on expression of the second , major pathogenicity island , SPI2 , which is required for intracellular proliferation ( Shea et al. , 1996 ; Cirillo et al. , 1998 ; Hensel et al. , 1998 ) .
Lack of Hfq results in global changes of protein expression and loss of protein secretion Considering the pleiotropic effect of Hfq on mRNA stability and translational regulation in other bacteria , we sought to determine Hfq - dependent changes in protein expression .
We first compared the whole - cell protein patterns in one - dimensional gels of wild - type and Dhfq cells from cultures grown aerobically in L - broth in three different growth phases : exponential - growth , early and late stationary - phase .
As shown in Fig. 3A , Dhfq cells exhibit no significant difference to the wild type in exponential phase .
In contrast , in stationary - phase the Dhfq mutation showed a markedly different protein pattern , with the most prominent and reproducible changes being two abundant protein bands of ~ 40 and ~ 55 kDa ( Fig. 3A ) .
Mass spectrometry ( MALDI - TOF ) identified the 40 kDa band as the major outer membrane protein ( OMP ) , OmpD .
Analysis of the 55 kDa band proved more complex , because MALDI - TOF analysis indicated the presence of two proteins , GlpK ( glycerol kinase ) and FliC ( major phase - 1 flagellin ) .
This band was further resolved with longer gel runs ( Fig. 3B , left panel ) and revealed that in the Dhfq mutant , FliC levels were strongly reduced whereas GlpK accumulated to higher levels .
Parallel analysis of the protein profile of an rpoS deletion strain showed that the Hfq - dependent regulation of OmpD , FliC and GlpK , was not related to lower s S levels in Dhfq cells .
Additional analyses revealed an increase in the levels of HtrA , YbfM , OmpF , CyoA and Tsf , and a decrease of the ribosomal proteins RpsD and RplC in the Dhfq strain .
To obtain a preliminary picture of global changes in the expression profiles of less abundant proteins , we also analysed early stationary - phase samples of wild - type and Dhfq cells resolved on twodimensional gels ( Fig .
Of the 69 protein candidates analysed by MALDI - TOF , 32 were upregulated in Dhfq cells , whereas 37 showed downregulation .
These results are summarized in Table 2 ( further details are given in Table S1 ) .
Loss of Hfq also affected the composition of the periplasmic protein population ( Fig. 3B , right panel ) .
While some of the changes in protein expression seen in Dhfq cells are shared with the rpoS deletion strain ( e.g. OppA and GltI ) , loss of Hfq leads to a specific increase in DppA , a decrease in TufB levels , and higher levels of OppA , MglB , GltI and GlnH as compared with the DrpoS strain ( Table 2 ) .
The most drastic effects of the hfq deletion , however , were observed with the secreted protein fraction ( Fig. 3C ) .
FliC , the most prominent protein found in Salmonella supernatants ( Komoriya et al. , 1999 ) and other secreted proteins typically seen in SL1344 supernatants , e.g. effector proteins that are translocated by the SPI1 TTSS ( Ehrbar et al. , 2002 ) , were either strongly reduced or undetectable .
The loss of secreted SPI1 effectors was consistent with the reduced invasion phenotype of the Dhfq strain .
None of these reductions were observed with the DrpoS strain ( Fig. 5A ) .

Overexpression of HilA in Dhfq rescues SPI1 effector protein expression but not secretion Consequently , we sought to determine if the Hfqdependent loss of secreted SPI1 effectors was due to a more general defect on SPI1 gene expression .
The activation of SPI1 genes is mediated by a transcription factor cascade .
On top of this cascade , the transcription factors , HilC and HilD , along with RtsA ( encoded outside SPI1 ) cooperate to transmit environmental signals that lead to derepression of hilA ( Bajaj et al. , 1996 ; Lucas and Lee , 2001 ; Schechter and Lee , 2001 ; Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ) .
HilA is the SPI1 major transcriptional activator responsible for most of the SPI1 TTSS and effector gene expression , both directly and indirectly through its activation of InvF ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ; Eichelberg and Galan , 1999 ; Lostroh and Lee , 2001 ) .
In addition , HilA also activates expression of secreted effector proteins encoded outside SPI1 , e.g. SopB encoded within SPI5 ( Ahmer et al. , 1999 ) .
To quantify the amount of HilA protein , we constructed a chromosomal FLAG epitope - tagged derivative of the hilA gene .
Quantification of Western blot signals obtained for HilA FLAG revealed a > sixfold reduction of the protein in the Dhfq mutant as compared with the wild type ( Fig. 4A , left panel ) .
In addition , Northern blot quantification showed that in Dhfq cells hilA mRNA was reduced to ~ 8 % of wild - type levels ( Fig. 4B ) .
Several transcriptional reporter fusions were also used to determine if the changes in hilA expression resulted from a reduced hilA promoter activity ( Fig. 4B ) .
Depending on the fusion used , hilA transcription in Dhfq was found to be reduced to between 30 % and 70 % of wild - type levels .
Collectively , this suggested that Hfq regulates HilA synthesis at both the transcriptional and the post - transcriptional level .
To verify that the lower HilA levels in the Dhfq strain cause a reduction of SPI1 effector protein synthesis , we first determined the intracellular levels of SipC , SipD , SopB and SopE on Western blots , all of which were readily detected in wild - type cells ( Fig. 4C , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
In stark contrast , no ( SipC , SopB , SopE ) or drastically reduced ( SipD ) signals were obtained in the Dhfq background ( lane 5 ) .

sion could restore effector protein expression in the absence of Hfq , the wild - type and the Dhfq strains were transformed with plasmid pBAD - HilA ( Lostroh et al. , 2000 ) , which carries a myc - tagged hilA gene under control of an arabinose - inducible P BAD promoter .
Arabinose induction yielded comparable HilA myc protein levels in both genetic backgrounds ( Fig. 4A , right panel ) , and fully restored the intracellular levels of effector proteins in Dhfq cells to wild - type amounts ( Fig. 4C , compare lanes 3 and 6 ) .
We next examined whether HilA overexpression could also restore effector protein secretion .
Supernatants of the same cultures used for whole - protein determinations in Fig. 4C were examined for extracellular levels of the aforementioned effector proteins .
In stark contrast to the full restoration of intracellular effector protein levels , HilA expression failed to significantly increase the extracellular amounts of these proteins in the Dhfq strain ( lanes 11 and 12 ) .
HilA overexpression in the Dhfq background was therefore able to overcome the loss of expression of these effector proteins but not of their secretion .
One possible explanation for this secretion defect was that the hfq mutation does not permit assembly of a functional SPI1 secretion apparatus .
The secreted PrgI protein , the main component of the needle of the SPI1 - encoded TTSS , provides a testable marker for a functional secretion apparatus ( Kimbrough and Miller , 2000 ; Kubori et al. , 2000 ) .
We determined both the intra - and extracellular PrgI levels in all of the strains , and found that this protein was absent in the Dhfq mutant ( Fig. 4C , lower panel , lanes 1 and 3 versus 5 , lanes 7 and 9 versus 11 ) .
In contrast , HilA overexpression led to elevated intracellular and secreted PrgI levels in the wild - type but not hfq strains ( lanes 4 and 6 versus 10 and 12 ) .
These results indicated that under aerobic - growth - conditions , Hfq affected SPI1 expression at multiple levels , and was required for the expression of the TTSS structural genes independent of HilA expression .
Effector protein secretion independent of hfq under SPI1 - inducing conditions As we had observed that the invasion defect of the Dhfq strain was less pronounced when grown under SPI1 - inducing conditions , we considered whether this was the result of improved effector protein secretion .
Indeed , supernatants of Dhfq cells cultured under SPI1 - inducing conditions displayed a protein pattern close to the wild type ( Fig. 5A , compare lanes 5 and 6 ) , except for the flagellar protein , FliC .
When these samples were probed on Western blots for the effectors SipC , SipD , SopB and SopE , a similar level of secretion as for the wild - type strain was evident for the hfq mutant ( Fig. 5B ) .
Furthermore , under these growth - conditions , the Dhfq strain accumulated the needle protein , PrgI , to wild - type levels both intracellularly and in the supernatant , arguing that under this growth - condition , Dhfq bacteria also possess a fully active SPI1 TTSS .
Impaired adhesion contributes to the non - invasive phenotype of Dhfq Although the Dhfq strain appeared to show wild - type levels of expression in terms of SPI1 function when grown Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 63 , 193 -- 217 202 A.

All strains were grown in LB - medium complemented with 0.05 % L - arabinose to facilitate HilA expression from plasmid pBAD - HilA .
under SPI1 - inducing conditions , it was puzzling that the mutant remained much less invasive .
One important factor that contributes to Salmonella invasion of host cells in addition to SPI1 function is successful adhesion to epithelial cells , mediated by fimbrial adhesins .
We therefore performed assays to compare the adhesion phenotypes of the wild - type and Dhfq strains .
To better visualize bacteria , both strains were transformed with a low - copy plasmid that constitutively expresses green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) .
Transformants were grown under SPI1 - inducing conditions , and used for infection of HeLa cells at a moi of 50 .
Following incubation at 37 °C for 1 h , bacteria that had not attached to the HeLa cells were removed by extensive washing of the cells .
The remaining bacteria and cells were fixed , and the number of bacteria per HeLa cell determined by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig .
For the wild - type strain , an average of ~ 30 bacteria per HeLa cell were found to be adherent .
In contrast , the average number observed with the Dhfq strain was significantly lower , i.e. ~ 10 bacteria per HeLa cell .
For both strains , we observed that a significant proportion of bacteria became internalized during the 1 h incubation step prior to counting .
As the assay does not allow us to clearly distinguish extra - from intracellular bacteria , our calculation includes all bacteria associated with HeLa cells , based on the assumption that every internalization event was preceded by successful adhesion .
To better separate adhesion from invasion rates , bacterial adherence was also determined in HeLa cell infection assays without gentamicin treatment .
To this end , serial dilutions of HeLa cells and adhered bacteria were plated on LB agar 30 min upon infection , and cfu determined ( Fig .
These experiments revealed a > twofold reduction in adhesion of the hfq deletion mutant as compared with wild - type Salmonella ( 25 % adherence of wild - type compared with 11 % of the hfq strain related to the input ) .
In contrast , adherence of the two control strains , hfq HIS and hfq - C , did not significantly differ from the wild type ( 21 % and 24 % respectively ) .
Collectively , the data suggest that a lower adhesion rate may contribute to the non - invasive phenotype of the hfq strain .
Dhfq is impaired in motility The strong Hfq dependence for expression of the phase 2 flagellin protein , FliC , suggested that Hfq would be required for Salmonella motility .
To verify reduced FliC expression , we first analysed fliC mRNA levels in wild type and Dhfq Salmonella at different growth phases ( Table 3 and Fig. 6A ) .
Interestingly , loss of Hfq caused a mere 1.6 - fold reduction of fliC mRNA levels in exponential phase , however , a sixfold reduction at early stationary phase ( Table 3 ) .
We also compared fliC mRNA stability in wild - type strain and Dhfq cells , and found it largely unaf - Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 63 , 193 -- 217 Hfq functions in Salmonella 203 Fig. 5 .

In contrast to fliC mRNA , we failed to detect fljB mRNA on any of these Northern blots ( data not shown ) .
Taken together , the reduced FliC expression of Dhfq is unlikely to result from phase variation of the invertible flagellar switch ( fljB/fljA promoter ) , but rather from reduced fliC transcription .
Next , we compared the motility of the wild - type and the Dhfq strains , harbouring either a control or complementation plasmid pStHfq - 6H , on motility agar plates .
Wild - type cells were motile and formed concentric motility rings around the point of inoculation ( Fig. 6B ) .
In contrast , the Dhfq mutant displayed impaired motility , as judged by the much smaller motility ring formed .

Two control strains , hfq - C and hfq HIS , were found to be as motile as the wild type ( data not shown ) , further supporting that loss of motility was a direct consequence of the lack of Hfq .
Growth rate - dependent repression of OmpD In addition to the positive regulation of secreted effector protein expression , the protein patterns obtained from different growth phases showed that Hfq was also involved in the repression of OmpD synthesis as cells progress into stationary - phase ( Fig. 3A ) .
To confirm a negative regulatory role for Hfq in OmpD regulation , protein samples of wild - type , Dhfq , DompD and Dhfq / DompD strains grown to early stationary - phase were compared ( Fig. 7A ) .
MALDI - TOF analysis of the 40 kDa protein band which showed higher levels of accumulation in the Dhfq strain unequivocally identified it as OmpD , consistent with the complete loss of this protein band in DompD and Dhfq/DompD cells .
Using fluorescent dye staining , we also quantified the relative OmpD accumulation , and found approximately twofold elevated levels of this protein in whole - cell lysates ( Fig. 7A ) .

A. Northern blot detection of fliC mRNA levels in wild - type and Dhfq cells at logarithmic and early stationary - phase before and within 32 min after rifampicin treatment .
Densitometry of the Northern blot signals showed that the fliC mRNA decays with the same half - life in both genetic backgrounds ( ~ 9 min or ~ 7 min in logarithmic or early stationary - phase cultures respectively ) .
5S signals are shown as loading control .
B. To measure motility , equal numbers of bacteria from each strain were inoculated onto a motility agar - plate .
The image was obtained following 4 h of incubation at 37 °C .
To learn more about the underlying mechanism of Hfqdependent ompD regulation , we first determined the relative changes in ompC and ompD mRNA abundance at three different points during the growth phase ( Table 3 ) .
We found that the Dhfq strain exhibited elevated ompC/D mRNA levels throughout growth .
We also followed the decay of both mRNAs after rifampicin treatment ( transcription block , Fig. 7B ) .
Figure 7C shows that absence of Hfq slowed ompD mRNA decay twofold ( half - lives : ~ 9 min versus ~ 16 min in wild - type and Dhfq strains ) , whereas ompC decay was not affected .
Next , we constructed transcriptional and translational reporter ( GFP ) plasmids for both mRNAs .
Quantification of GFP reporter activity showed a slightly decreased ompD promoter activity ( 0.82 - fold ) at early stationary phase , whereas ompD translation was upregulated > 2.5 - fold ( Table 3 ) .
As the enhanced activity of the translational ompD fusion was consistent with elevated OmpD protein levels ( Fig. 7A ) , we reasoned that Hfq may bind to the 5 ′ region of the ompD mRNA to interfere with its translation .
To test this hypothesis , we synthesized a 5 ′ fragment of the ompD mRNA , encompassing its 5 ′ UTR and 118 nucleotides of the coding region , and performed in - vitro mobility - shift assays with purified Hfq protein .
Figure 7D shows that Hfq binds this fragment with high affinity .
Up to four different Hfq/ompD complexes are observed with increasing Hfq concentration , indicating that there are several Hfq binding sites in the ompD 5 ′ UTR .
In contrast , no significant shift was observed with an Hfq - independent RNA ( 5 ′ UTR of metK ) within a 250 nM range of Hfq ( Fig. 7D ) .
Taken together , these data suggests a direct role for Hfq in translational repression of the ompD mRNA .
Discussion The RNA chaperone , Hfq , has recently been recognized as a major post - transcriptional regulator of bacterial gene expression which participates in numerous regulatory pathways ( Valentin - Hansen et al. , 2004 ) .
First identified as a host factor for replication of RNA phage Qb in E. coli , Hfq has been shown to have a broad impact on physiology in several bacteria .
The role of Hfq beyond phage replicative functions was first shown with an E. coli hfq : : W mutation , which resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes related mainly to reduced survival of stress conditions ( Tsui et al. , 1994 ) .
Later , Hfq was found to be required in E. coli and Salmonella for efficient translation of rpoS mRNA , encoding the general stress sigma factor , s S ( Brown and Elliott , 1996 ; Muffler et al. , 1996 ) .
As RpoS is required for Salmonella proliferation in mice ( Fang et al. , 1992 ; Nickerson and Curtiss , 1997 ; Humphreys et al. , 1999 ) , it has been assumed that Hfq plays an important role in Salmonella virulence ( e.g. Ding et al. , 2004 ) .
However , the mechanisms by which Hfq affects the pathogenicity of Salmonella remained undefined .
Previous work in E. coli established that Hfq also has regulatory functions independent of its effects on s S expression ( Muffler et al. , 1997 ) .
Likewise , B. abortus does not possess an RpoSlike s factor ( Roop et al. , 2003 ) , yet an hfq mutant of B. abortus has a pronounced virulence defect ( Robertson and Roop , 1999 ) .
Similarly , the virulence defect of a V. cholerae hfq mutant was not accompanied by reduced s S levels ( Ding et al. , 2004 ) .
Peroral infection of the Salmonella hfq mutant revealed about the same degree of attenuation ( Fig. 2A ) as reported for a Salmonella DrpoS mutant , i.e. approximately a three - Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 63 , 193 -- 217 Hfq functions in Salmonella 205 Fig. 7 .

Generally , hfq mutants of several Salmonella strains exhibit four - to sevenfold reduced RpoS levels ( Fig .
S6 ; Brown and Elliott , 1996 ; Bang et al. , 2005 ) .
This is about the degree of RpoS reduction observed in the mouse - avirulent strain , LT2 , which has an altered rpoS start codon .
At first glance , these observations appear to support a model in which reduced s S production would fully account for the attenuation of Dhfq .
However , using a set of newly constructed SL1344 hfq mutant and control strains , we defined hfq phenotypes that relate to virulence and global gene expression ( see Fig. 8 for a summary ) , and which are largely independent of s S .

Summary of phenotypes of the Salmonella hfq mutation determined in this study .
The most prominent virulence - associated phenotype we observed is the drastically reduced invasiveness of the Dhfq mutant ( Table 1 ) .
The ability of Salmonellae to invade cultured non - phagocytic cells is dependent on the expression of SPI1 - encoded genes ( Lee et al. , 1992 ) , and is strongly dependent on growth - rate and media .
Two growth - conditions showing maximal invasiveness have been defined : growth in LB with aeration to early stationary - phase , and growth in low - oxygen , high - salt media ( SPI1 - inducing ) .
We found that although the hfq mutant is defective for invasion under both conditions , the underlying mechanisms are different .
When grown to early stationary - phase , the Dhfq strain fails to activate the SPI1 transcription factor cascade , characterized by reduced HilA levels and the lack of SPI1 effector protein expression .
Our observation that HilA overexpression resulted in the re - appearance of secreted protein expression indicated that the major target of Hfq regulation is HilA activation .
This conclusion is also supported by the appearance of normal intracellular levels of SopB and SopE ( Fig. 4C ) , both of which are encoded outside of SPI1 and whose expression requires the concerted function of InvF and SicA .
The latter , SPI1 - encoded genes are also highly dependent on HilA for expression ( Darwin and Miller , 2000 , and references therein ) .
The regulation of hilA promoter activity is complex , involving the coactivators HilC , HilD and RtsA , as well as other factors which act upstream of these proteins ( Lostroh and Lee , 2001 ; Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ; and references therein ) .
A global transcriptome microarray analysis indicated that Dhfq cells have several - fold reduced levels of hilC/D and rtsA mRNAs ( A. Sittka et al. , unpubl .
results ) , suggesting that Hfq affects signal transmission further upstream in the SPI1 - activating cascade .
Strikingly , complementation with the HilA plasmid restored intracellular levels of several effector proteins encoded within SPI1 , yet not their secretion .
The latter observation may result from a failure to assemble a functional SPI1 TTSS , because only traces of the needle protein , PrgI , were detected in supernatants of HilA - complemented Dhfq cells .
The prgI gene is encoded within the SPI1 prgHIJKorgABC operon ( Klein et al. , 2000 ) , and is directly controlled by HilA .
These observations suggest that the role of Hfq as a novel factor of SPI1 gene activation may not be confined to promoting HilA expression .
It remains possible that Hfq either is also involved in the mRNA stability of the prgHIJKorgABC operon transcript , or affects the translation of the encoded gene products .
Further work is required to clarify the effects of Hfq on this subset of HilA - dependent genes .
In contrast to aerobic - growth , under SPI1 - inducing conditions the Dhfq mutant shows normal SPI1 gene expression , TTSS assembly ( as judged by PrgI levels in the supernatant ) and effector protein secretion ( Fig. 5B ) .
Under these growth - conditions , the Dhfq mutant should have been capable of invasion of non - phagocytic cells , yet invasion was strongly reduced compared with the wild - type strain ( Table 1 ) .
Our results from adhesion and motility assays as well as proteome analysis indicate several other factors may contribute to this impairment .
The hfq mutant shows a significantly reduced ability to adhere to HeLa cells ( Fig .
S5 ) , which is likely to affect the rate of invasion .
The hfq mutant is non - motile ( Fig. 6 ) , due most likely to the loss of the flagellar subunit protein , FliC ( Figs 3A -- C and 6A ) .
However , while flagellamediated bacterial motility accelerates the invasion of Salmonella , motility per se is not required for invasion ( van Asten et al. , 2004 ) .
Finally , a preliminary proteome analysis ( Table 2 ) showed differential regulation of numerous lipoproteins and OMPs , suggesting that Hfq is also involved in regulation of genes related to the bacterial envelope composition .
Importantly , Dhfq cells exhibit strongly elevated levels of HtrA , also known as DegP .
HtrA/DegP has recently been shown in Salmonella and E. coli to be part of the s E regulon that mediates the response to envelope stress ( Rhodius et al. , 2006 ; Skovierova et al. , 2006 ) , and activation of the s E pathway ( by RpoE overexpression ) results in a strong induction of htrA mRNA ( Rhodius et al. , 2006 ) .
Three additional proteins that promote OMP assembly , FkpA , YraP and YaeT , and whose genes are members of the s E core regulon ( Rhodius et al. , 2006 ; Skovierova et al. , 2006 ) , also showed elevated levels in the hfq mutant .
In addition , two strictly s E - dependent small RNAs , MicA and RybB , showed promoter activation in the hfq mutant under the same conditions used in this study ( Papenfort et al. , 2006 , and unpublished results ) .
Interestingly , strong induction of the s E response was also observed in a V. cholerae hfq mutant ( Ding et al. , 2004 ) .
Based on the activation of multiple s E - dependent genes , the Dhfq strain appears to experience chronic envelope stress which Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 63 , 193 -- 217 Hfq functions in Salmonella 207 would ultimately change outer membrane properties .
In summary , we suggest that the multiple phenotypes of the hfq mutant on motility and adherence , and an apparent chronic cell envelope stress in Salmonella all contribute to the observed reduced invasiveness of the hfq mutant .
A comparison of the hfq phenotypes that relate to virulence of Salmonella and other previously studied pathogenic bacteria reveals interesting similarities yet also major differences .
Hfq mutants of the rather closely related species , V. cholerae and P. aeruginosa , are severely attenuated for virulence in mice ( Sonnleitner et al. , 2003 ; Ding et al. , 2004 ) .
In contrast , hfq mutants of L. monocytogenes and L. pneumophila show only mild virulence defects in Balb/c mice and an amoeba infection model respectively ( Christiansen et al. , 2004 ; McNealy et al. , 2005 ) .
A mouse virulence defect was also described for the B. abortus hfq mutant , although Hfq did not appear to affect spleen colonization per se , but rather the survival and/or persistence in this organ ( Robertson and Roop , 1999 ) .
Survival in macrophages was investigated for L. pneumophila , L. monocytogenes and B. abortus , and the effects of the respective hfq mutations were comparable to those described here for Salmonella , although the B. abortus hfq was affected in long - term macrophage survival ( Robertson and Roop , 1999 ; Christiansen et al. , 2004 ; McNealy et al. , 2005 ) .
Thus far , L. monocytogenes is the only other species for which an hfq mutant has been studied with respect to non - phagocytic cell invasion , and unlike Salmonella , the L. monocytogenes hfq mutant was found to be fully invasive ( Christiansen et al. , 2004 ) .
Also in contrast to the Salmonella hfq mutant , the assembly of functional pili and secretion of cholera toxin was not affected in the hfq mutant of V. cholerae ( Ding et al. , 2004 ) .
In light of the variability and diversity of Hfq function ( s ) in virulence among these pathogens , the clear loss of SPI1 expression and the secretion phenotype shown here for Salmonella provide an excellent basis to dissect the mechanisms of Hfq functions in a well - characterized model pathogen .
Analyses of protein patterns on one - and twodimensional gels showed that the expression of a large number of Salmonella genes is affected by Hfq .
Classification of these genes according to the genome annotation of Salmonella LT2 ( McClelland et al. , 2001 ) shows that the encoded proteins belong to diverse functional categories ( Table 2 ) .
The increase of GlpK and GlpQ in the hfq mutant is currently unexplained , but might indicate changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism ( note that the glpK and glpQ genes are not linked ) .
Other pronounced changes include OMPs such as OmpD , the flagellin FliC , and numerous periplasmic proteins .
Given that Hfq has recently been in the spotlight as a small RNA - binding protein ( Valentin - Hansen et al. , 2004 ) , the altered periplasm of Dhfq cells is of particular interest .
Specifically , the ~ 200 nt GcvB RNA of E. coli as well as its Yersinia pestis homologue was shown to negatively regulate the periplasmic proteins , OppA , DppA and GltI ( Urbanowski et al. , 2000 ; McArthur et al. , 2006 ) , which all accumulate to higher levels in the Dhfq strain ( Fig. 3B ) .
The molecular mechanism of GcvB action in these two species remains unknown , but OppA was found to strongly accumulate in an E. coli Dhfq mutant ( Ziolkowska et al. , 2006 ) .
Moreover , GcvB co - immunoprecipitates with E. coli Hfq ( Zhang et al. , 2003 ) , suggesting that this protein mediates GcvB binding to trans - encoded target mRNAs .
As the gcvB gene is conserved and expressed in Salmonella ( Urbanowski et al. , 2000 ; C.M. Sharma and J. Vogel , unpublished ) , it is tempting to speculate that the high levels of OppA , DppA and GltI observed here results from a loss of GcvB - mediated mRNA repression in the absence of Hfq .
Of the 71 proteins with altered levels in the hfq mutant ( Table 2 ) , five have no known homologues in E. coli ( SipA , SipC , STM1254 , STM1328 and STM2494 ) .
Of the remaining 66 , seven overlap with previously published Hfqassociated E. coli mRNAs , i.e. CspD , Dps , LppA , LppB , OmpX , RplL and YfiA ( Zhang et al. , 2003 ) .
Notably , the majority of these are proteins whose expression was reduced , suggesting Hfq might function to stabilize their mRNAs , either directly or indirectly by promoting efficient translation .
One of the most drastic changes we observed in the absence of Hfq is the increase in OmpD levels ( Fig. 7A ) .
OmpD is a Salmonella - specific porin , and is the most abundant protein in the outer membrane under standard growth - conditions .
Together with the other major porins , OmpC and OmpF , it accounts for ~ 1 -- 2 ¥ 10 5 porins per cell ( Santiviago et al. , 2003 ) .
Expression of this porin is regulated primarily at the level of transcription , is subject to catabolite - repression , and the ompD promoter is repressed by low pH. However , post - transcriptional activation of OmpD expression under anaerobiosis has also been reported , and shown to depend on the global transcription regulator , FNR ( Santiviago et al. , 2003 ) , whereas bile appears to repress ompD posttranscriptionally ( Prouty et al. , 2004 ) .
Despite its abundance , the physiological roles of OmpD remain unclear .
Unlike the other two major porins , OmpC and OmpF , OmpD is not regulated by osmolarity ( Santiviago et al. , 2003 ) .
The only physiological role of OmpD elucidated thus far is its requirement for the efficient efflux of the toxic compound , methyl viologen ( Santiviago et al. , 2002 ) .
In contrast , possible contributions of OmpD to Salmonella pathogenicity remain a matter of debate .
Two LD 50 studies of Salmonella wild - type and ompD mutant strains in mice yielded inconsistent results ( Dorman et al. , 1989 ; Meyer et al. , 1998 ) .
Other studies postulated a requirement of OmpD for adherence to human macrophages and intestinal epithelial cell lines ( Negm and Pistole , 1998 ; Hara - Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 63 , 193 -- 217 208 A. Sittka , V. Pfeiffer , K. Tedin and J. Vogel Kaonga and Pistole , 2004 ) .
Intriguingly , the presence of ompD correlates with the ability of Salmonella serovars to grow in alternative , non - human hosts .
Santiviago et al. ( 2003 ) identified ompD in all Salmonella serovars that have multiple mammalian hosts , e.g. S. typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis , but its absence in Salmonella typhi , which is restricted to humans .
In any case , the conservation of ompD argues for an important function , and the data obtained here implicate Hfq as a novel factor of ompD mRNA regulation at the post - transcriptional level .
Hfq binds with high affinity and presumably at multiple sites to the ompD 5 ′ UTR in - vitro , and its absence stabilizes the ompD mRNA in - vivo .
Interestingly , both these observations bear striking similarity to the previously reported Hfq - dependent control of OmpA , the major OMP of E. coli , i.e. increased ompA mRNA stability in E. coli hfq mutants , and Hfq binding of this messenger ( Vytvytska et al. , 1998 ; Udekwu et al. , 2005 ) .
Importantly , it has recently become clear that one role of Hfq in this regulation may be the promotion of MicA function , an Hfq - dependent sRNA that represses ompA mRNA translation in stationary - phase ( Rasmussen et al. , 2005 ; Udekwu et al. , 2005 ) .
There is ample evidence of fine tuning of E. coli OMP expression by Hfq - dependent sRNAs .
In addition to MicA , six E. coli sRNAs , namely MicC , MicF , OmrA/B , RseX and RybB , were shown to mediate repression of single or multiple OMP - encoding mRNAs ( reviewed in Guillier et al. , 2006 ; Vogel and Papenfort , 2006 ) .
Similarly , unpublished results from our laboratory show that ompD mRNA is acted upon by the Salmonella homologues of the E. coli sRNAs , MicC and RybB .
In addition , the SPI1 - endoded 80 nt InvR RNA negatively regulates ompD expression .
As all these sRNAs are Hfq - dependent , we hypothesize that the posttranscriptional effect of Hfq on ompD expression reported here is mediated by Hfq - dependent regulatory sRNAs .
In summary , this study implicates Hfq as a major posttranscriptional regulator of Salmonella gene expression .
Unlike other abundant global regulatory proteins , e.g. Fis , IHF , H - NS and HU ( Harrison et al. , 1994 ; Wilson et al. , 2001 ; Schechter et al. , 2003 ; Mangan et al. , 2006 ) , Hfq is primarily known to act at the RNA level .
Interestingly , similar to H - NS that recognizes AT - rich sequences in DNA , Hfq binds to AU - rich RNA species .
It has recently been proposed that H - NS repression serves to silence newly acquired genomic loci with different GC - content , thus avoiding detrimental consequences from unregulated expression of these genes following their uptake by Salmonella ( Lucchini et al. , 2006 ; Navarre et al. , 2006 ) .
Experiments are currently underway to determine if Hfq plays a similar role by specifically acting onAU - rich mRNAs of newly acquired genes .
If so , Hfq may again turn out to be the ` host factor ' as which it was originally described 40 years ago ( Franze de Fernandez et al. , 1968 ) .

Chromosomal mutagenesis of Salmonella SL1344 followed the protocol described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 2000 ) with few modifications .
Strain JVS - 00008 , which carries plasmid pKD46 , was grown in LB at 28 °C complemented with - ampicillin and 0.2 % L - arabinose to an OD 600 of 0.5 .
Cells were collected by centrifugation ( 2 min , 11 000 g ) , washed three times with ice - cold H 2O , and dissolved in 1/100 of the original culture volume .

The chromosomal tagging was verified by PCR with oligonucleotides JVO - 839 / 840 , and sequencing of the PCR product .
Plasmids Plasmids used , and details of their construction are described in Table 5 .
Maps of selected plasmids are provided in the supplementary material ( Fig .
E. coli TOP10 and TOP10F ′ strains were used for cloning .
All plasmids were purified using the Machery - Nagel Plasmid QuickPure Kit .
To transform Salmonella strains , these were rendered competent using the same protocol as described above , except that cells were cultured at 37 °C without arabinose .
Control plasmids based on pZE12 - luc were constructed as follows : to lower the copy number of plasmid pZE12 - luc , the ColE1 origin was swapped to pSC101 * by inserting the AvrII - SacI fragment of plasmid pZS * 24 - MCS1 , resulting in pVP003 .
To obtain plasmid designated pVP012 , a low - copy version of control plasmid pJV968 - 1 , the 1.5 kb ` lacZ ' XbaI / XhoI fragment of the latter was introduced into pVP003 by the same enzymes .
Note that these plasmids lack the P LlacO promoter region of pZE12 - luc , hence the insert is not transcribed .
To express Hfq - 6HIS under control of its own promoter , low - copy vector pVP003 was digested with XhoI/XbaI and ligated to a PCR product obtained with the primer pair JVO - 0370/0182 ( JVO - 0370 binds 1014 bp upstream of the hfq open reading frame ( ORF ) in miaA while JVO - 182 adds a 6HIS - tag sequence followed by a stop codon to the last codon of hfq ) .
For clarity , the obtained plasmid , pVP004 - 1 , is designated in figures as pStHfq - 6H .
Control plasmid pJV300 was obtained by ligation of a pZE12 - luc derived PCR product .
The -1 site of promoter P LlacO is fused to the second position of the XbaI site ( which is destroyed upon cloning ) .
Transcription from the P LlacO promoter now yields a ~ 50 nt nonsense transcript derived from the rrnB terminator on pJV300 .
To obtain a low - copy version of this plasmid , the origin was changed to pSC101 * as described above , yielding pVP009 .
To clone transcriptional GFP fusions , a PCR fragment was amplified from plasmid pJV859 - 8 ( GFP expression plasmid ) using oligonucleotides JVO - 0888 / pZE - XbaI .
JVO - 0888 introduces stop codons after a XhoI and NheI site in all three ORFs , a ribosome binding site , a 7 bp spacer , and the sequence of the first six amino - acids ( aa ) of the GFP coding region with a silent mutation at position 6 ( T ( r ) C ) to destroy the GFP internal NheI site .
Plasmid pJV859 - 8 was cut XhoI ( removing the promoter region , the ribosome binding site and the sequence for the first 142 aa of GFP ) , gel - purified , and the vector backbone ligated to the PCR fragment digested with the same enzyme .
Due to the internal XhoI site in the GFP coding region ( cuts in the sequence after aa 142 ) this leads to a promoterless transcriptional - fusion plasmid ( used as a negative control plasmid in transcriptional - fusion experiments ) .
The resulting plasmid was designated pAS0046 .
For construction of the ompC - gfp transcriptional - fusion plasmid pAS0057 - 1 and the ompD - gfp transcriptional - fusion plasmid pAS0058 - 1 , pAS0046 was digested with AatII/NheI and ligated to PCR products amplified with primer pairs JVO - 0801 / 0805 and JVO - 0806/0807 respectively , cut with the same enzymes .
For translational ompD : : gfp and ompC : : gfp fusions , PCR fragments of oligonucleotides JVO - 0726 / 0802 and JVO - 0717/0801 respectively , were inserted into plasmid pJV859 - 8 by AatII/NheI cloning , yielding plasmids pVP019 ( GFP fusion to 15th aa of OmpD ) and pVP020 ( GFP fusion to 12th aa of OmpC ) respectively .
To overexpress and purify Salmonella Hfq protein , the hfq coding region was amplified with primer pair JVO - 0078 / 0084 .
The PCR product was SapI digested and ligated to the N - terminal fusion vector pTYB11 cut with enzymes SapI / SmaI , yielding plasmid pAS009 .
P22 transduction P22 lysates were prepared from soft agar plate lysates of donor strains using P22 phage HT/105 -1 by standard procedures .
Transductions were performed as described by Sternberg and Maurer ( 1991 ) using P22 phage HT/105 -1 and Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 63 , 193 -- 217 210 A. Sittka , V. Pfeiffer , K. Tedin and J. Vogel Table 5 .

The Hfq dilutions ( 1 , 2 , 3.9 , 7.8 , 15.6 , 31.3 , 62.5 , 125 , 250 , 500 or 1000 nM ; calculated for the Hfq hexamer ) were prepared in 1 ¥ dilution buffer ( 1 ¥ structure buffer with 1 % glycerol , 0.1 % Triton X - 100 ) .
Prior to gel run , the binding reactions were mixed with 3 ml ofloading buffer ( 50 % glycerol , 0.5 ¥ TBE , 0.2 % bromphenolblue ) , and electrophoresed on native 6 % polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 ¥ TBE buffer at 300 V at 4 °C for 3 h. Gels were dried , and analysed using a phosphorimager ( see above ) .
To synthesize the Hfq - independent metK control RNA , a DNAtemplate for T7 RNApolymerase in - vitro - transcription was amplified with primers JVO - 1701 / 1702 .
The resulting RNA spans the entire 5 ′ UTR ( 129 nt ) according to the +1 transcriptional start site mapped in Wei and Newman ( 2002 ) and 80 bp Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Molecular Microbiology , 63 , 193 -- 217 214 A. Sittka , V. Pfeiffer , K. Tedin and J. Vogel of the metK coding region .
In vitro transcription and the labelling reaction were performed as described for ompD RNA .
Fluorescence measurements Strains carrying the GFP fusion plasmids were inoculated from single colonies in 20 ml LB - medium supplemented with 20 mg ml -1 chloramphenicol and incubated with aeration at 37 °C / 220 rpm .
At the indicated cell density , 3 ¥ 100 ml culture were transferred to a 96 well plate , and fluorescence was measured at 37 °C using a VICTOR TM 3 machine ( 1420 Multilable Counter , Perkin Elmer ) .
All experiments were done in triplicates .
Plasmid pJV859 - 8 , which expresses GFP from a constitutive P LtetO promoter , served as a control .
In transcriptional fusion studies , strains carrying plasmid pAS0046 served as background control , while plasmid pJU004 was used in translational fusion studies .
A detailed protocol of fluorescence measurement will be described elsewhere ( Urban and Vogel , 2006 ) .
