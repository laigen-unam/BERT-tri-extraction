Here , we report that the two - component regulatory system BaeSR increases multidrug and metal resistance in Salmonella through the induction of drug efflux systems .
Screening of random fragments of genomic DNA for the ability to increase - lactam resistance in Salmonella enterica led to the isolation of a plasmid containing baeR , which codes for the response regulator of BaeSR .
When overexpressed , baeR significantly increased the resistance of the acrB strain to oxacillin , cloxacillin , and nafcillin .
baeR overexpression conferred resistance to novobiocin and deoxycholate , as well as to - lactams in Salmonella .
The increase in drug resistance caused by baeR overexpression was completely suppressed by deletion of the multifunctional outer membrane channel gene tolC .
TolC interacts with different drug efflux systems .
Among the nine drug efflux systems in Salmonella , quantitative real - time PCR analysis showed that BaeR induced the expression of acrD and mdtABC .
Double deletion of these two genes completely suppressed BaeR - mediated multidrug resistance , whereas single deletion of either gene did not .
The promoter regions of acrD and mdtABC harbor binding sites for the response regulator BaeR , which activates acrD and mdtABC transcription in response to indole , copper , and zinc .
In addition to their role in multidrug resistance , we found that BaeSR , AcrD , and MdtABC contribute to copper and zinc resistance in Salmonella .
Our results indicate that the BaeSR system increases multidrug and metal resistance in Salmonella by inducing the AcrD and MdtABC drug efflux systems .
We found a previously uncharacterized physiological role for the AcrD and MdtABC multidrug efflux systems in metal resistance .

Salmonella enterica is a pathogen that causes a variety of diseases in humans ranging from gastroenteritis to bacteremia and typhoid fever ( 65 ) .
In the 1990s , the prevalence of multidrug - resistant S. enterica increased dramatically in the United Kingdom ( 67 , 68 ) , the United States ( 20 , 23 ) , and Canada ( 41 ) .
Many countries have also documented outbreaks associated with drug - resistant Salmonella in poultry , beef , and swine ( 10 , 12 , 21 , 34 , 69 ) .
Emerging resistance to antibiotics in Salmonella has been found in both humans and animals and is thus a potentially serious public health problem ( 9 , 58 ) .
High - level fluoroquinolone resistance in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium phage type DT204 has been shown to be largely attributable to multiple target gene mutations and to active efflux by the AcrAB - TolC system ( 4 , 5 ) .
Multidrug efflux pumps cause serious problems in cancer chemotherapy and the treatment of bacterial infections .
In bacteria , resistance to drugs is often associated with multidrug transporters that function to decrease cellular drug accumulation ( 42 , 72 ) .
Multidrug transporters in bacteria are classified into five families on the basis of sequence similarity : the major facilitator ( MFS ) , resistance - nodulation - cell division ( RND ) , small multidrug resistance , multidrug and toxic compound extrusion , and ATP - binding cassette families ( 8 , 55 , 60 ) .
In gramnegative bacteria , pumps belonging to the RND family are especially effective in generating resistance ( 35 , 36 , 42 , 71 ) .
The sequencing of bacterial genomes enables us to trace putative drug - resistance genes ( 56 , 57 ) .
There are many putative and proven drug transporters in the Salmonella genome .
Recent studies have shown that S. enterica serovar Typhimurium has nine functional drug efflux pumps ( 46 ) .
Because many of these multidrug transporters have overlapping substrate spectra ( 46 ) , it is intriguing that bacteria , with their economically organized genomes , harbor such large sets of multidrug efflux genes .
The key to understanding how bacteria utilize these multiple transporters lies in the regulation of transporter expression .
Currently available data show that multidrug transporters are often expressed under precise and elaborate transcriptional control ( 2 , 7 , 22 , 29 ) .
Expression of acrAB , which encodes the major AcrAB efflux pump , is subject to multiple levels of regulation .
In Escherichia coli , it is modulated locally by the repressor AcrR ( 30 ) .
At a more global level , it is modulated by stress conditions and by global regulators such as MarA , SoxS , and Rob ( 62 , 63 ) .
Olliver et al. ( 53 ) reported that mutation in acrR contributes to overexpression of acrAB in S. enterica and increases resistance to multiple drugs .
Eaves et al. ( 14 ) reported that acrB , acrF , and acrD are coordinately regulated and that their expression influences the expression of the transcriptional activators marA and soxS .
Furthermore , it has been reported that integration of an IS1 or an IS10 element in the upstream region of the acrEF operon causes increased expres - 9066 VOL .
189 , 2007 MULTIDRUG AND METAL RESISTANCE OF SALMONELLA 9067 TABLE 1 .
These examples illustrate the complexity and diversity of the mechanisms regulating bacterial multidrug efflux pumps .
However , few data are available on the regulation of S. enterica multidrug transporter genes other than acrAB , acrD , and acrEF ( 14 , 52 , 53 ) .
In the present study , we report positive regulation of the multidrug efflux pump mdtABC and acrD genes by a response regulator , BaeR , of the two - component BaeSR signal transduction system ( 38 ) , a phenomenon that leads to increased resistance to - lactams , novobiocin and deoxycholate .
Despite compelling evidence implicating multidrug efflux systems in multidrug resistance , the ongoing debate concerning the `` natural '' function of these efflux proteins has not abated ( 25 , 40 , 59 , 70 ) .
The various considerations regarding the physiological role of multidrug transporters have been thoroughly reviewed ( 28 , 39 , 40 ) .
In the present study , we show that BaeSR , AcrD , and MdtABC contribute to copper and zinc resistance in Salmonella in addition to their role in multidrug resistance .
The results suggest a previously uncharacterized physiological role for AcrD and MdtABC in metal resistance .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains , plasmids , and growth - conditions .
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in the present study are listed in Table 1 .
The S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains used are derived from the wild - type strain ATCC 14028s ( 17 ) .
Phage P22 - mediated transductions were performed as described previously ( 13 ) .
Bacterial strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth ( 64 ) .
Cells were rapidly collected for total RNA extraction when the cultures reached an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm .
Screening for positive regulators of multidrug resistance .
DNA manipulation generally followed standard practice ( 64 ) .
A genomic library was made by partial Sau3AI digestion of the chromosomal DNA as follows .
Chromosomal DNA prepared from an overnight culture of the wild - type strain ATCC 14028s ( 17 ) was digested with Sau3AI ( 1 U l 1 ) for 15 , 20 , 30 , or 40 min .
The digested DNA was separated on a 0.8 % agarose gel , and fragments approximately 0.5 to 3 kb in size were purified and ligated into the BamHI site of vector pHSG398 ( Takara Bio , Japan ) .
The ligation products were transformed into E. coli DH5 ( 64 ) , selecting for chloramphenicol - resistant transformants .
Plasmid DNA was prepared from a pool of 16,000 transformants and used to transform the acrB deletion strain EG16565 ( 46 ) .
Cells were plated on LB agar medium ( 64 ) containing 15 g of chloramphenicol/ml and inhibitory concentrations of various drugs .
The baeR gene was amplified from ATCC 14028s genomic DNA by using the primers and listed in Table 2 , which introduced BamHI and SalI sites at the ends of the amplified 9068 NISHINO ET AL. .
This PCR product was cloned between the BamHI and SalI sites of the vector pHSG398 ( Takara Bio ) to produce the plasmid pHSGbaeR .
Construction of gene deletion mutants .
Gene deletion was performed according to the method of Datsenko and Wanner , with recombination between short homologous DNA regions catalyzed by phage Red recombinase ( 11 ) .
A curable expression plasmid encoding Red recombinase ( pKD46 ) was introduced into strain ATCC 14028s .
The chloramphenicol resistance gene cat or the kanamycin resistance gene kan , flanked by Flp recognition target sites , was amplified TABLE 3 .

Values in boldface are larger than those of a corresponding parental strain harboring the pHSG398 vector .
MIC determinations were repeated at least three times .
by PCR using the primers listed in Table 2 .
Plasmid pKD3 or pKD4 was used as a template .
This PCR product was used to transform the ATCC 14028s strain expressing Red recombinase , and recombinant clones were isolated as chloramphenicol - or kanamycin - resistant colonies .
The pKD46 vector was eliminated by incubation at a nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C , as confirmed by the loss of resistance to ampicillin .
The chromosomal structure of the mutated loci was verified both by PCR as described previously ( 11 ) and by Southern hybridization with probes specific for ( i ) the antibiotic resistance genes used during the construction of the chromosomal deletions and ( ii ) sequences flanking the inactivated loci .
The deletions were then transferred to the wild - type ATCC 14028s strain by P22 transduction .
The cat and kan genes were eliminated by using plasmid pCP20 as described previously ( 11 ) .
Construction of targeted single copy lac fusion strains .
A chromosomal lacZY fusion strain was constructed as described previously ( 16 ) .
A cat or kan cassette was amplified from pKD3 or pKD4 plasmid by using primers listed in Table 2 , and drug transporter genes were disrupted by the one - step gene inactivation method ( 11 ) .
After removing the cat or kan cassette using plasmid pCP20 , the lacZY transcriptional - fusion plasmid pCE37 ( 16 ) was integrated into the FLP target sequence downstream of the promoter of the drug efflux genes by FLPmediated recombination .
Thus , the drug efflux genes were deleted in the resulting strains .
To investigate the expression of drug transporter genes , the constructed strains listed in Table 1 were streaked onto L - agar plates containing 80 g of X - Gal ( 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - - D - galactopyranoside ) / ml .
Single colonies of each bacterial strain to be assayed were inoculated into 2 ml of LB broth containing the appropriate antibiotics .
After growth overnight at 37 °C , the cultures were diluted 1:50 in the same medium and grown at 37 °C to late log phase .
To assay the effects of indole and metals on gene expression , 2 mM indole , 2 mM CuSO 4 , or 1 mM ZnSO 4 was added to secondary cultures .
- Galactosidase was assayed by using ONPG ( onitrophenyl - - D - galactopyranoside ) as described previously ( 33 ) .
All assays were performed in triplicate .
Determination of the MIC for toxic compounds .
The antibacterial activities of different agents were determined on L agar ( 1 % tryptone , 0.5 % yeast extract , 0.5 % NaCl ) plates containing the compounds ( Sigma ) indicated in Table 3 at various concentrations .
Agar plates were made by the twofold agar dilution technique as described previously ( 51 ) .
To determine the MICs , bacteria were grown in LB broth at 37 °C overnight , diluted into the same medium , and then tested at a final inoculum size of 10 4 CFU l 1 by using a multipoint inoculator ( Sakuma Seisakusyo , Tokyo , Japan ) after incubation at 37 °C for 20 h .
The MIC was the lowest concentration of compound that inhibited cell growth .
Total RNA was isolated from bacterial cultures by using an RNeasy Protect Bacteria minikit ( QIAGEN ) and RNase - free DNase ( QIAGEN ) as described previously ( 44 ) .
The absence of genomic DNA from DNase - treated RNA samples was confirmed by both nondenaturing agarose electrophoresis gels and PCR with primers known to target genomic DNA .
The RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically ( 64 ) .
189 , 2007 MULTIDRUG AND METAL RESISTANCE OF SALMONELLA 9069 Determination of specific transcript levels by quantitative real - time PCR after reverse transcription .
Bulk cDNA samples were synthesized from total Salmonella RNA by using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents ( PE Applied Biosystems ) and random hexamers as described previously ( 45 , 50 ) .
The specific primer pairs listed in Table 2 were designed by using ABI Prism primer express software ( PE Applied Biosystems ) .
rrs of the 16S rRNA gene was chosen as the normalizing gene ( 46 ) .
Real - time PCR was performed with each specific primer pair by using SYBR green PCR Master Mix ( PE Applied Biosystems ) .
The reactions were run on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system ( PE Applied Biosystems ) ; the fluorescence signal due to SYBR green intercalation was monitored to quantify the double - stranded DNA product formed in each PCR cycle .
Purification of the BaeR protein .
Histidine - tagged BaeR protein was expressed in E. coli M15 [ pREP4 ] ( QIAGEN ) containing plasmid pQEbaeRH6 , and the protein was purified on Ni 2 - nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin ( QIAGEN ) as follows .
Cells were grown in 80 ml of LB - medium containing 100 g of ampicillin/ml and 25 g of kanamycin/ml to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 , at which time IPTG ( isopropyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM , and incubation was continued for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in 1 ml of the binding buffer ( 5 mM imidazole , 0.5 M NaCl , 20 mM Tris - Cl [ pH 7.9 ] ) containing 1 mg of lysozyme/ml , left on ice for 30 min , and disrupted by sonication .
The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C , and 2.5 ml of a 50 % slurry of Superflow resin in the binding buffer was added .
The mixture was left for 1hat 4 °C with slow stirring and then poured into a column , which was washed with 7 ml of binding buffer , followed by 10 ml of wash buffer ( 60 mM imidazole , 0.5 M NaCl , 20 mM Tris - Cl [ pH 7.9 ] ) .
The histidine - tagged BaeR protein was eluted from the column with 8 ml of 250 mM imidazole in 0.5 M NaCl -- 20 mM Tris - Cl ( pH 7.9 ) .
DNA fragments used for the electrophoretic mobility - shift assay were amplified by the PCR using S. enterica serovar Typhimurium chromosomal DNA as a template .
Fragments were end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ - 32 P ] ATP and purified by using a Qiaquick nucleotide removal kit ( QIAGEN ) .
Approximately 25 pmol of labeled DNA and 0 , 50 , 100 , or 150 pmol of BaeR protein in a 100 - l volume was incubated at room temperature for 15 min .
The binding buffer used for protein - DNA incubations was composed of 20 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 50 g of bovine serum albumin/ml , 2.5 g of salmon sperm DNA/ml , and 10 % glycerol .
Samples ( 20 l ) were run on a 4 % nondenaturing Tris - glycine polyacrylamide gel at 2 °C .
After electrophoresis the gel was dried and autoradiographed .
Single colonies of each bacterial strain to be assayed were inoculated into 2 ml of LB .
After growth overnight at 37 °C , the cultures were diluted to an A 600 of 0.1 in the same medium .
Spectrophotometric readings were then taken with a Versa Max microplate reader ( Molecular Devices ) .
To assay the effects of metals on cell growth , 600 M CuSO 4 or 600 M ZnSO 4 was added to the secondary cultures .
RESULTS Overexpression of BaeR increases resistance to oxacillin .
Expression of multidrug efflux genes is often regulated in a complex manner , as described in the introduction .
We therefore screened the Salmonella genomic library for genes that increased multidrug resistance levels in this organism .
Our preliminary effort with an acrB strain , however , failed to isolate genes conferring multidrug resistance .
We therefore used a host strain lacking a functional acrB gene in the screening in order to identify regulatory elements involved in the expression of other multidrug resistance systems .
The library was made from the chromosomal DNA of strain ATCC 14028s .
Random fragments of chromosomal DNA were cloned into the BamHI site of vector pHSG398 as described in Materials and Methods .
The recombinant plasmids were transformed into the acrB strain EG16565 , and the transformants were plated on LB agar containing 15 g of chloramphenicol/ml and inhibitory concentrations of various drugs .
In one experiment , the medium contained 8 g ofoxacillin , which had an MIC of 2 g/ml against EG16565 ( acrB ) .
When one of the transformant colonies that grew on this medium was purified and reexamined , we indeed found an eightfold increase in oxacillin MIC against the transformant ( data not shown ) .
Introduction of the plasmid isolated from this strain into fresh acrB cells resulted in the same oxacillin resistance phenotype : the MIC was increased eightfold over the recipient strain ( data not shown ) .
Sequencing of the plasmid revealed an insertion containing the complete coding sequence of baeR and a partial sequence of baeS .
BaeR is the response regulator of a putative twocomponent system , which also includes the sensor kinase BaeS , encoded in a gene located upstream of baeR ( 38 ) .
It seemed likely that in cells carrying this plasmid , overexpressed BaeR was causing the transcriptional activation of genes involved in oxacillin resistance .
To test whether overexpression of baeR confers oxacillin resistance on the Salmonella acrB strain , full - length wild - type baeR was amplified by PCR and cloned in the pHSG398 vector to obtain pbaeR ( Table 1 ) , which was then introduced into the acrB strain EG16565 .
Oxacillin MICs for cells harboring pbaeR were eight times higher ( 16 versus 2 g/ml ) than for cells harboring the pHSG398 vector ( Table 3 ) , suggesting that the BaeR regulator produced by this plasmid conferred oxacillin resistance on Salmonella .
Further experiments in the present study were therefore carried out with pbaeR .
When pbaeR was used to transform ATCC 14028s cells , which express the AcrB pump ( 46 ) , no effect on oxacillin resistance was observed ( data not shown ) , presumably because the intrinsic multidrug efflux pump AcrB masks the effect of baeR overexpression and ATCC 14028s was already highly resistant to this drug .
Overexpression of BaeR increases resistance to - lactams , novobiocin , and deoxycholate .
Our results had shown that overexpression of baeR increased Salmonella resistance to oxacillin , a - lactam antibiotic .
We therefore investigated the effect of baeR overexpression on the susceptibility of Salmonella to other - lactams .
pbaeR was also found to increase the resistance of acrB cells to cloxacillin and nafcillin ( Table 3 ) .
Various other drugs were tested , including common substrates of multidrug transporters , and we found that pbaeR increased the resistance of the acrB strain to novobiocin and deoxycholate ( Table 3 ) .
These results indicate that the overproduced BaeR regulator induces multidrug resistance in Salmonella .
The sensor kinase of a typical two - component system monitors some environmental conditions and accordingly modulates the phosphorylation state of the response regulator .
Overexpression of baeR is thought to mimic the physiological phosphorylation response as previously reported ( 1 , 27 ) .
There was no change in the level of resistance to various other toxic compounds tested such as erythromycin , doxorubicin , acriflavin , benzalkonium chloride , carbonyl - cyanide - m-chlorophenylhydrazone , cefamandole , crystal violet , enoxacin , ethidium bromide , methylene blue , nalidixic - acid , norfloxacin , ofloxacin , rhodamine - 6G , tetracycline , and tetraphenylphosphonium bromide .
Effect of tolC deletion on the multidrug resistance modulated by the BaeR regulator .
The results described above indicate that the expression of a multidrug exporter ( s ) may be induced by the overexpression of baeR .
In a previous study , it was revealed that at least nine intrinsic drug efflux transporters are encoded in the S. enterica chromosome ( 46 ) .
Among these , 9070 NISHINO ET AL. .
Fold induction of specific transcripts attributed to baeR overexpression as determined by qRT - PCR a Gene Fold increase ( mean SD ) acrB/vector .
The results are shown in Table 4 .
The expression levels of mdtABCD , acrD , and tolC were significantly increased ( more than fivefold compared to basal levels ) by baeR overexpression : 150 - , 64 - , 25 - , 11 - , 15 - , and 5.4 - fold increases were observed for mdtA , mdtB , mdtC , mdtD , acrD , and tolC , respectively .
Overexpression of baeR did not increase the expression levels of other drug exporter genes ( Table 4 ) .
BaeR controls the expression of mdtABC , acrD , and tolC .
To investigate the effect of baeR overexpression on the expression levels of the mdt operon , acrD and tolC , we constructed strains in which E. coli lacZY replaced the chromosomal copies of the drug efflux system genes shown in Table 1 .
We streaked strains harboring the vector or the pbaeR plasmid onto X - Gal LB agar plates ( Fig. 1A ) .
The mdtA - lacZY and acrD - lacZY strains overexpressing baeR were blue on plates containing 80 g ofX - Gal/ml , whereas the strains harboring the pHSG398 vector were white ( Fig. 1A ) .
Both the tolC - lacZY strains harboring the pHSG398 vector and pbaeR plasmid were blue ( Fig. 1A ) be - a The amount of transcript was determined by qRT - PCR as described in Materials and Methods .
The fold change ratio was calculated by dividing the expression level of the gene in the acrB/pbaeR strain by that in the acrB/vector strain .
Experiments were performed in triplicate , and the data are represented as mean values the standard deviation .
The values in boldface indicate increases of more than twofold .
RND - family transporters play major roles in both intrinsic and elevated resistance of gram - negative bacteria to a wide range of noxious compounds , including - lactams ( 31 , 42 , 43 , 47 , 48 ) .
RND transporters need two other proteins for their function : a membrane fusion protein and an outer membrane channel .
It has been reported that many drug transporter systems in E. coli need TolC to function ( 15 , 18 , 47 , 49 ) .
TolC is also present in S. enterica , and deletion of it increases susceptibility to many antimicrobial - agents and chemical - compounds ( 46 ) .
In order to determine whether BaeR - mediated multidrug resistance is attributable to the TolC - dependent drug exporter ( s ) , we investigated the effect of tolC deletion on the drug resistance of the baeR - overexpressing cells .
Deletion of tolC from the strain acrB increased susceptibility to oxacillin , cloxacillin , nafcillin , novobiocin , and deoxycholate ( Table 3 ) , which is in good agreement with recent reports ( 6 , 46 ) .
The tolC deletion completely inhibited BaeR - mediated multidrug resistance ( Table 3 ) .
This result indicates that BaeR - mediated multidrug resistance is attributable to increased expression of a TolC - dependent drug exporter ( s ) .
Determination of the amounts of drug exporter transcripts by quantitative real - time reverse transcription - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) .
In order to determine which drug exporters show increased expression when baeR is overexpressed , we used qRT - PCR to investigate changes in the amounts of drug exporter gene mRNAs dependent on baeR overexpression .
Total RNAs were isolated from exponential - phase cultures of acrB/vector and acrB/pbaeR , and cDNA samples were synthesized by using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents ( PE Applied Biosytsems ) with random hexamers as primers .
Real - time PCR of the cDNAs was performed with each specific primer pair using the SYBR green PCR Master Mix ( PE Applied Biosystems ) .
The expression levels of drug exporter genes ( except for acrB ) and tolC in acrB/pbaeR were compared to those in FIG. 1 .
Effect of the BaeR regulator on the expression levels of Salmonella drug transporter genes .
( A ) The mdtA - lacZY/vector ( NES7 ) , mdtA - lacZY/pbaeR ( NES8 ) , acrD - lacZY/vector ( NES3 ) , acrDlacZY/pbaeR ( NES4 ) , tolC - lacZY/vector ( NES61 ) , and tolC - lacZY / pbaeR ( NES62 ) strains were streaked onto LB agar plates containing X - Gal ( 80 g/ml ) .
The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and photographed the following day .
( B ) Expression levels of the mdtAlacZY , acrD - lacZY , and tolC - lacZY strains harboring the vector or the pbaeR plasmid were determined as described in Materials and Methods .
The data correspond to mean values of three independent experiments .
Error bars correspond to the standard deviation .
189 , 2007 MULTIDRUG AND METAL RESISTANCE OF SALMONELLA 9071 cause the tolC gene is constitutively expressed in complex laboratory media ( 46 ) .
Measurements of - galactosidase activity showed that baeR overexpression conferred higher - galactosidase activities on the mdtA - lacZY , acrD - lacZY , and tolClacZY strains than the pHSG398vector ( Fig. 1B ) .
These results indicate that BaeR protein induces the expression of the MdtABC and AcrD drug efflux systems and the TolC outer membrane channel .
Effects of deletion of drug exporter genes on BaeR - mediated multidrug resistance .
In order to determine whether multidrug resistance mediated by baeR overexpression is due to increased expression of mdtABC and acrD , we investigated the effects of deleting these genes on drug resistance levels in acrB/vector and acrB/pbaeR ( Table 3 ) .
When mdtABC and acrD were deleted separately or simultaneously from the acrB strain , there was no change in drug resistance in the resulting strains .
In the acrD acrB strain , overexpression of baeR conferred resistance to oxacillin , cloxacillin , nafcillin , novobiocin , and deoxycholate , but the resistance levels conferred by BaeR were lower than those in the acrB/pbaeR strain , suggesting that the AcrD drug efflux system makes some contribution to the multidrug resistance modulated by the BaeR regulator .
In the mdtABC acrB strain , baeR overexpression conferred resistance to oxacillin , cloxacillin , nafcillin , novobiocin , and deoxycholate , but the levels of resistance to oxacillin , cloxacillin , and novobiocin were lower than those in the acrB/pbaeR strain , suggesting that the MdtABC drug efflux system contributes to the multidrug resistance modulated by the BaeR regulator .
On the other hand , overexpression of baeR conferred no drug resistance on the mdtABC acrD acrB strain ( Table 3 ) .
Together , these data indicate that the multidrug resistance conferred by the BaeR regulator is due to increased expression of both the mdtABC and acrD drug efflux system genes .
BaeR - binding site sequence motifs .
Our previous analysis using an E. coli DNA microarray and the motif - finding program revealed the BaeR - binding site sequence motif in E. coli .
This motif has an 18 - bp consensus sequence : 5 - TTTTTCTC CATDATTGGC - 3 ( where D is G , A , or T ) ( 44 ) .
To investigate whether the BaeR - binding motif exists in the upstream region of the mdt operon and acrD in S. enterica , we used the program Gene Promoter Scan ( GPS ) ( 73 , 74 ) .
We identified sequences resembling the BaeR box in the region upstream of the mdt operon and acrD ( Fig. 2A ) .
A search of the regions upstream ( 100 bp ) of tolC did not reveal the consensus sequence resembling the BaeR box .
To examine the ability of the BaeR protein to bind the promoter regions of mdt operon and acrD , we first constructed a derivative of the baeR gene encoding a protein with six histidine residues at its amino terminus , and we showed that a plasmid encoding this baeR derivative ( pQEbaeRH6 shown in Table 1 ) could activate the transcription of the mdtABC and acrD genes ( data not shown ) .
An electrophoretic - mobility - shift assay with the purified BaeR - His 6 protein showed binding to the regions upstream of the mdt operon and acrD ( Fig. 2B ) .
As a control , an assay showed no interaction between BaeR and the fragment including the acrA promoter ( Fig. 2B ) .
These results indicate that the mdtABC and acrD drug efflux genes are directly regulated by BaeR protein ( Fig. 2C ) .

E. coli is responsive to indole ( 44 ) , we investigated the possibility that indole may induce expression of the acrD and mdtABC drug efflux systems in Salmonella .
We also tested whether the two - component BaeSR signal transduction pathway was involved in this induction .
First , the induction of mdtA and acrD expression in response to indole was examined .
- Galactosidase assays showed that indole leads to induction of mdtA and acrD expression in a wild - type strain ( Fig. 3 ) .
When the BaeSR pathway is ablated , indole induction of mdtA and acrD is still observed , although at markedly reduced levels ( Fig. 3A and B ) .
Because expression of mdtABC and acrD in E. coli is also responsive to zinc ( 26 ) , we sought to determine whether metals induce mdtABC and acrD .
We found that copper and zinc induce the expression of mdtA and acrD in a wild - type back - 9072 NISHINO ET AL. .
The BaeSR signal transduction pathway activates mdtA and acrD expression in response to indole , copper , and zinc .
( A and B ) - Galactosidase levels were assayed in strains with the mdtA - lacZY transcriptional - fusion in the wild - type ( mdtA - lac ) and baeSR genetic background ( baeSR mdtA - lac ) ( B ) or with the acrD - lacZY transcriptional - fusion in wild - type ( acrD - lac ) and baeSR genetic background ( baeSR acrD - lac ) in either the absence or the presence of 2 mM indole , 2 mM copper , or 1 mM zinc ( B ) .
Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences ( * , P 0.05 ; ** , P 0.01 ) in the paired Student t test .
Removal of the BaeSR signal transduction pathway eliminated copper and zinc induction of mdtA and acrD expression ( Fig. 3A and B ) .
These data suggest that the BaeSR system contributes to the induction of mdtA and acrD expression in response to copper and zinc .
Role of MdtABC , AcrD , and BaeSR in metal resistance .
Because our results above indicate that expression of mdtABC and acrD is induced by metals ( Fig. 3 ) , and because there was no change in drug resistance in strains when mdtABC and acrD were deleted ( Table 3 ) , we investigated the possibility that the MdtABC and AcrD efflux systems may have physiological roles in metal homeostasis in addition to multidrug resistance .
To examine the physiological relevance of MdtABC and AcrD in metal homeostasis , we characterized a strain that is completely devoid of the chromosomal mdtABC and acrD genes .
We tested the sensitivity of acrD mdtABC to copper and zinc , since our results showed that these metals are signals that activate both efflux systems .
Wild - type and the acrD mdtABC double mutant were grown in LB broth in the absence or the presence of copper ( 600 M ) or zinc ( 600 M ) , and growth was measured ( Fig. 4 ) .
In the absence of metals , both strains grew at approximately the same rate .
In contrast , in the presence of copper or zinc , the acrD mdtABC double mutant grew more poorly than the wild - type strain ( Fig. 4 ) .
These data suggest that AcrD and MdtABC contribute to metal resistance in Salmonella .
TolC was also required for normal cell growth in the presence of cooper or zinc ( Fig. 4 ) .
Further , we performed identical growth experiments with the baeSR mutant and found that it grew more poorly than the wild - type strain in the presence of copper or zinc ( Fig. 4 ) even though its growth in LB - medium was normal .
These observations indicate that BaeSR must regulate the expression of the mdtABC and acrD efflux genes , which contribute to copper and zinc adaptation .
Together , the results indicate that induction of the MdtABC and AcrD efflux systems by the BaeSR signal transduction system contribute to metal resistance in Salmonella .
DISCUSSION In this study , we performed a genome - wide search for a regulator of multidrug resistance in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium by random shotgun cloning and discovered BaeR , which upregulates the mdtABCD locus and acrD , thereby increasing resistance to - lactams , novobiocin , and deoxycholate .
We initially found by random shotgun cloning that the plasmid carrying baeR conferred oxacillin resistance on the VOL .
189 , 2007 MULTIDRUG AND METAL RESISTANCE OF SALMONELLA 9073 FIG. 4 .
acrD mdtABC , baeSR , and tolC mutants are more sensitive to copper and zinc .
Growth of wild - type , acrD mdtABC , baeSR , and tolC strains was monitored by measuring the A 600 of cultures in either the absence or the presence of 600 M copper ( A ) or 600 M zinc ( B ) .
Copper and zinc inhibit the growth of acrD mdtABC , baeSR , and tolC more than the wild type .
The strains used were ATCC 14028s , NKS117 , NKS206 , and NKS144 .
However , when this plasmid was used to transform ATCC 14028s cells , which express the AcrB pump ( 46 ) , no effect on oxacillin resistance was observed ( data not shown ) , presumably because ATCC 14028s was already highly resistant to this drug ; the MIC against oxacillin in this strain was 512 g/ml ( Table 3 ) .
Then we investigated the susceptibility of the acrB strain overexpressing baeR to various drugs , including common substrates of multidrug transporters , and found that BaeR stimulates Salmonella resistance to oxacillin , cloxacillin , nafcillin , novobiocin , and deoxycholate ( Table 3 ) .
BaeR exhibits sequence similarity to the response regulators and is likely to constitute a two - component regulatory system with a sensor kinase , BaeS .
The genes baeS and baeR were first identified during random screening for the two - component signal transduction genes in E. coli on the basis of their ability to suppress mutational lesions of the sensor kinase genes envZ and phoR/creC phenotypically ( 38 ) .
BaeR and BaeS exhibit an in - vitro phosphotransfer reaction in the presence of ATP ( 38 ) .
baeS and baeR are found immediately downstream of mdtABCD ( Fig. 2C ) ( 3 , 37 ) , and the start codon of each successive member of this cluster of six genes is immediately adjacent to or overlaps the stop codon of the preceding one ( 32 ) .
Thus , these genes probably form an operon .
In the present study , we found that overexpression of BaeR strongly stimulates the expression of mdtABCD and acrD in Salmonella .
Sequences resembling the BaeR box were found in the region upstream of the mdt - bae operon and acrD ( Fig. 2A ) , and an electrophoretic - mobility - shift assay showed that the BaeR protein binds to these regions ( Fig. 2B ) .
BaeR thus regulates the transcription of the mdt - bae operon and acrD directly .
It should regulate the expression of baeS and baeR positively because these genes form an operon with mdtABCD .
This indicates that the BaeS/BaeR two - component system generates a positive feedback loop by regulating the mdt - bae operon ( Fig. 2C ) .
Recently , it has been reported that Salmonella BaeR controls the expression of the outer membrane proteins OmpW and STM3031 , which might be associated with ceftriaxone resistance ( 24 ) .
In the present study , we found that BaeR activates expression of the multifunctional outer membrane channel gene tolC in S. enterica .
Search of the regions upstream ( 100 bp ) of tolC did not reveal the consensus sequence resembling the BaeR box , and an electrophoretic - mobility - shift assay did not show significant BaeR binding to this region ( data not shown ) , suggesting that BaeR may indirectly activates the expression of tolC .
coli , TolC is required for the function of the MdtABC and AcrD multidrug efflux systems ( 47 ) .
TolC induction by the two - component BaeS/BaeR system may be required to form complexes with BaeR - induced AcrD or MdtABC .
Indeed , tolC is required for the multidrug resistance stimulated by baeR overexpression ( Table 3 ) .
Both AcrD and MdtABC are required for the Salmonella multidrug resistance induced by BaeR ( Table 3 ) , indicating that this resistance is due to the increased expression of acrD and mdtABC .
BaeR also activates the expression of mdtD , which encodes a putative MFS - type transporter , but it has been reported that mdtD is not related to multidrug resistance ( 3 , 37 , 48 ) .
Raffa and Raivio showed that the BaeSR system controls an envelope stress response in E. coli that induces expression of a distinct set of adaptive genes including spy , which is a member of the Cpx stress response regulon ( 61 ) .
Genome - wide transcriptional analysis also revealed that spy is a member of the BaeSR regulon , like mdtABC and acrD ( 44 ) .
Indole , a toxic compound expected to disrupt the bacterial envelope , induces the expression of spy ( 61 ) , mdtABC , and acrD ( 44 ) .
We found that indole also induces expression of MdtABC and AcrD in Salmonella ( Fig. 3 ) , and the two - component BaeSR signal transduction pathway is involved in this induction .
These findings therefore have potentially important implications for the influence of envelope stress on bacterial resistance to antibiotics .
In addition to the roles of MdtABC , AcrD , and BaeSR in multidrug resistance , we found that they contribute to copper and zinc resistance in Salmonella .
Both copper and zinc are essential for organisms but can be toxic , and microorganisms express diverse resistance mechanisms .
We showed that the expression of mdtABC and acrD is induced by copper or zinc , and BaeSR is involved in this induction ( Fig. 3 ) .
Some bacterial 9074 NISHINO ET AL. .
efflux pumps export not only antibiotics and other substances , such as dyes and detergents ( 35 , 59 ) , but also host - derived antimicrobial - agents ( 66 ) .
This finding has led to the suggestion that the physiological role of these systems is evasion of such naturally produced molecules , thereby allowing the bacterium to survive in its ecological niche .
In the present study , we found that the MdtABC , AcrD drug efflux systems and the twocomponent BaeSR signal transduction system contribute to copper and zinc resistance in Salmonella ( Fig. 4 ) .
The baeSR mutant was more sensitive to zinc than the acrD mdtABC double mutant ( Fig. 4B ) , indicating that BaeSR may regulate an additional zinc resistance determinant .
Our results suggests that the MdtABC and AcrD efflux systems may have physiological roles in metal homeostasis in addition to multidrug resistance , because there was a change in metal resistance in the strains when mdtABC and acrD were deleted ( Fig. 4 ) but there was no change in drug resistance ( Table 3 ) , and because the contributions of MdtABC , AcrD , and BaeSR to metal resistance were observed in the wild - type background ( Fig. 4 ) , but their contributions to drug resistance were observed only in the acrB background .
The MdtABC and AcrD systems may be related to bacterial metal homeostasis by transporting metals directly .
This is reminiscent of the copper and silver resistance mechanism by cation efflux of the CusABC system belonging to the RND protein superfamily ( 19 , 54 ) .
Our results suggest a previously uncharacterized physiological role for AcrD and MdtABC in metal resistance .
Further investigation of the regulation of multidrug efflux systems in several natural environments , such as inside hosts or soil , is needed in order to understand the biological significance of their regulatory networks .
Such investigation may provide further insights into the role of multidrug efflux systems in the physiology of the cell .
