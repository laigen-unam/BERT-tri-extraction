Slauch 1,3 * Department of Microbiology , 1 Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , 2 and College of Medicine , 3 University of Illinois , Urbana , Illinois 61801 Upon contact with intestinal epithelial cells , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium injects a set of effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm via the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) type III secretion system ( T3SS ) to induce inflammatory diarrhea and bacterial uptake .
The master SPI1 regulatory gene hilA is controlled directly by three AraC - like regulators : HilD , HilC , and RtsA .
Previous work suggested a role for DsbA , a periplasmic disulfide bond oxidase , in SPI1 T3SS function .
RtsA directly activates dsbA , and deletion of dsbA leads to loss of SPI1 - dependent secretion .
We have studied the dsbA phenotypes by monitoring expression of SPI1 regulatory , structural , and effector genes .
Here we present evidence that loss of DsbA independently affects SPI1 regulation and SPI1 function .
The dsbA - mediated feedback inhibition of SPI1 transcription is not due to defects in the SPI1 T3SS apparatus .
Rather , the transcriptional response is dependent on both the flagellar protein FliZ and the RcsCDB system , which also affects fliZ transcription .
Thus , the status of disulfide bonds in the periplasm affects expression of the SPI1 system indirectly via the flagellar apparatus .
RcsCDB can also affect SPI1 independently of FliZ .
All regulation is through HilD , consistent with our current model for SPI1 regulation .

Salmonella enterica serovars cause disease in humans ranging from mild gastroenteritis to lethal enteric fever ( 17 ) .
Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) encodes a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) that is an important virulence apparatus through which the pathogen injects effector proteins directly into the cytoplasm of host epithelial cells .
The resulting physiological response leads to the gastrointestinal symptoms of infection as well as cellular uptake of the bacteria that is necessary to initiate systemic disease ( 23 ) .
Intricate regulation of SPI1 gene expression presumably restricts production of the T3SS to when the bacteria are in a specific location within the host and coordinates the assembly process of the secretion apparatus ( 20 , 38 ) .
The master SPI1 regulatory gene hilA is controlled directly by three AraC - like regulators : HilD , HilC , and RtsA ( 19 , 53 , 58 ) .
HilC and HilD are encoded in the SPI1 locus , while RtsA is encoded elsewhere in the chromosome in an operon with RtsB , which negatively regulates expression of flhDC and therefore the entire flagellar regulon ( 19 ) .
HilC , HilD , and RtsA are each capable of activating expression of hilC , hilD , and rtsA , creating a complex regulatory loop that controls hilA expression ( Fig. 1 ) ( 15 ) .
HilA directly activates transcription of the inv/spa and prg/org promoters on SPI1 ( 3 ) .
Encoded in the inv operon , the AraC - like protein InvF can activate transcription of other genes located within and outside of the SPI1 locus , including sopB , encoding a secreted effector protein ( 24 ) .
The expression of effector genes requires both InvF and the secretion chaperone SicA , which apparently coordinates transcription of effector protein genes with assembly of the SPI1 T3SS ( 12 ) .
DsbA , a monomeric 21 - kDa periplasmic protein , plays an important role in the folding of cell envelope proteins by catalyzing disulfide bond formation using a catalytic CXXC motif ( for a review , see reference 35 ) .
After DsbA reacts with a target protein , it is reoxidized by the inner membrane protein DsbB , which then passes the electrons to quinones in the cytoplasmic membrane ( 4 ) .
The Salmonella virulence plasmidencoded SrgA is a DsbA paralog whose activity is also dependent on a functional DsbB ( 6 ) .
DsbA is required for full virulence in a number of pathogenic organisms .
For example , a functional DsbA is required for proper assembly of cholera toxin in Vibrio cholerae ( 54 ) , heat - stable toxin in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( 52 ) , and invasin in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ( 42 ) .
DsbA has also been shown to be required for the proper function of the T3SS in Yersinia pestis ( 34 ) , Shigella flexneri ( 64 ) , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 28 ) .
SrgA or DsbA is also required for folding of SpiA , the outer membrane component of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) - encoded T3SS ( 48 ) .
We previously provided evidence that DsbA is required for both SPI1 - and SPI2 - dependent type III secretion in Salmonella strains ( 18 ) .
Mutations or treatments that interfere with disulfide bond formation in the periplasm are among the signals that activate the RcsCDB phosphorelay system , composed of the sensor RcsC , the response regulator RcsB , and the phosphotransfer protein RcsD ( YojN ) ( 45 ) .
RcsB , alone or together with RcsA , either positively or negatively regulates transcription of target genes , including activating those for capsule synthesis and biofilm formation ( 45 ) .
An rcsC constitutive mutant exhibits de - 87 88 LIN ET AL. .
These signals feed into the SPI1 regulatory network at HilD .
We present further evidence that , independently of the regulatory effect , DsbA is required for assembly and/or function of the SPI1 apparatus .

creased transcription of invasion genes including hilA , invF , sipC , and invG in a process that is RcsB dependent ( 50 ) .
RcsCDB can also negatively regulate the flagellar regulon ( 21 ) , which contains more than 60 genes grouped into three classes according to their transcriptional hierarchy ( 22 ) .
Class I is composed of the flhDC master operon , which encodes transcriptional activators essential for the expression of class II operons .
The protein products of class II operons include the alternative sigma factor FliA , the anti - sigma factor FlgM , and those required for the structure and assembly of the flagellar hook - basal body .
Proper assembly of this structure allows the export of FlgM , freeing the FliA sigma factor to activate the class III operons ( 36 , 51 ) .
The fliA and flgM genes are in separate operons , each of which is expressed from both class II and class III promoters ( 25 , 32 ) .
FliZ is encoded in the fliA operon and is reported to be an enhancer of class II flagellar gene expression ( 31 ) .
FliZ activates expression of hilA , one of the links between regulation of SPI1 and motility ( 33 , 44 ) .
Our previous work suggested a role for DsbA in SPI1 T3SS assembly or function ( 18 ) .
In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , RtsA , HilD , and HilC directly activate dsbA and deletion of dsbA leads to loss of SPI1 function .
Transcription of effector proteins was also significantly decreased in the dsbA mutant background .
These results led us to propose a model in which RtsA coordinates expression of SPI1 and DsbA , required for functional assembly of the SPI1 machinery .
We proposed that loss of the machine caused feedback inhibition of effector gene expression .
In this work , we present evidence that dsbA - mediated feedback inhibition is not simply through the SPI1 T3SS apparatus .
Rather , we show that SPI1 responds to the disulfide bond status of the periplasm through the RcsCDB system and the flagellar system as reflected in the level MATERIALS AND METHODS Media , reagents , and enzymatic assays .
Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium was used for routine growth of bacteria ( 46 ) .
Motility agar contained 0.3 % Bacto agar , 1 % tryptone , and 0.5 % NaCl .
Bacterial strains were grown at 37 °C , except for those containing the temperature - sensitive plasmids pCP20 and pKD46 ( 7 , 13 ) , which were grown at 30 °C .
Antibiotics were used at the concentrations indicated : ampicillin , 100 g/ml ; chloramphenicol , 10 g/ml ; kanamycin , 50 g/ml ; apramycin , 50 g/ml .
Enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen or New England Biolabs and were used according to the manufacturers ' recommendations .
Primers were purchased from IDT Inc. - Galactosidase assays were performed using a microtiter plate assay as previously described ( 60 ) .
For most of these assays , strains were cultured overnight in LB and then subcultured in LB - medium containing 1 % NaCl and 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and grown statically overnight .
- Galactosidase activities were calculated as ( micromoles of o - nitrophenol formed per minute ) 10 6 / ( optical density at 600 nm milliliters of cell suspension ) .
The values are means standard deviations , where n 4 .
All bacterial strains are isogenic derivatives of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 and are listed in Table 1 .
Deletions of various genes and concomitant insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette were constructed using Red - mediated recombination ( 13 , 65 ) as described previously ( 16 ) .
The endpoints of each deletion are indicated in Table 1 .
The appropriate insertion of the antibiotic resistance marker was verified by P22 linkage to known markers and/or PCR analysis .
In each case , the constructs resulting from this procedure were moved into a wild - type background ( strain 14028 ) by P22 transduction .
In some cases , antibiotic resistance cassettes were removed by using the temperature - sensitive plasmid pCP20 carrying the FLP recombinase ( 13 ) .
All bacterial strains were rebuilt at least once , and experiments were repeated with the independent constructs .
The pAH125 lacZ reporter system is a CRIM plasmid that confers kanamycin resistance ( 29 ) .
The replacement of the kanamycin cassette with the apramycin cassette from a related plasmid , pAE2 ( W. W. Metcalf and A. C. Eliot , unpublished data ) , was accomplished using Red - mediated recombination ( 13 ) , creating plasmid pDX1 .
The transcription start sites of hilA , invF , sicA , sopB , and prgH have all been mapped ( 12 , 43 , 57 ) .
We amplified by PCR and cloned P hilA ( 4973 420 bp ) , P invF ( 1533 202 bp ) , P sicA ( 2713 130 bp ) , P sopB ( 3563 297 bp ) , and P prgH ( 2653 116 bp ) upstream of the promoterless lacZ gene in pDX1 .
The resulting constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis .
These promoter - lacZ reporter plasmids were stably integrated in single copy on the Salmonella chromosome at the attB site using Int , thus creating single - copy transcriptional - fusions without disrupting the native gene .
PCR analysis was used to confirm the presence of reporters in single copy .
The hilA gene ( 273 1671 bp ) was amplified using primers carrying XbaI and SphI sites and Pfu DNA polymerase ( Stratagene ) , digested , and cloned into the arabinose - inducible vector pBAD33 ( 27 ) to generate pHilA .
The fliZ gene ( 143 571 bp ) was amplified using primers carrying EcoRI and BamHI sites and then cloned into vector pWKS30 ( 63 ) .
Western blot analysis of secreted proteins .
Western blot detection of secreted SopB in pHilA background strains was performed after diluting overnight cultures 1/100 in 10 ml of LB - medium without NaCl containing chloramphenicol and 0.01 % L - arabinose .
These cultures were grown with shaking at 225 rpm on a platform shaker for 4hat37 °C .
The hilA strains used for detection of SopB were grown statically overnight in LB containing 1 % NaCl .
In either case , 10 ml of culture was centrifuged at 5,000 g .
The cell pellet was washed and resuspended in 200 l of 50 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) .
Fifteen microliters of 2 sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) loading buffer ( 39 ) was added to 15 l of the suspension ( approximately 2 10 8 cells ) .
This was considered the whole - cell extract .
The original culture supernatant was centrifuged again and then filter sterilized using a 0.2 - m - diameter syringe filter and concentrated to 1 ml using an Amicon - 15 filter .
Proteins were precipitated with ice - cold trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10 % by incubating them on ice for 30 min and collected by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C .
The supernatant was then removed , and the trichloroacetic acid precipitate was washed with 1 ml of ice - cold 95 % ethanol to which 100 l saturated sodium acetate and 50 l 0.2 % phenol red indicator were added .
The samples were then centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 g .
This procedure was repeated until the solution was neutralized ( 66 ) .
The pellet was VOL .

washed a final time in 95 % ethanol and allowed to air dry .
The pellet was then resuspended in 15 l of 50 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) , and 15 l of2 SDS loading buffer was added .
Proteins in both the whole - cell extracts and supernatant samples were separated by electrophoresis in 7.5 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels ( 39 ) and blotted onto nitrocellulose ( BioTrace ; Pall Corporation ) using a Bio - Rad MiniProtean 3 electrophoresis system for 2hat 300 mA .
The blots were blocked with 5 % nonfat dried milk in phosphate - buffered saline containing 0.1 % Tween 20 .
The primary antibody was rabbit anti - SopB antibody .
The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit immunoglobulin G ( Zymed , South San Francisco , CA ) and was detected using 1/10 ,000 ECL substrate and ECL Hyperfilm ( Amersham , Piscataway , NJ ) .
RESULTS Loss of DsbA affects transcription of SPI1 genes .
We previously showed that the SPI1 regulators RtsA , HilC , and HilD activate dsbA from a novel promoter in serovar Typhimurium and that DsbA is required for SPI1 secretion of effector proteins ( 18 ) .
In the dsbA mutant , transcription of invF and genes downstream in the regulatory circuit was significantly reduced .
This led us to propose that misfolding of a machine component ( s ) in the dsbA mutant resulted in feedback regulation of SPI1 gene transcription .
According to our original data , transcription of hilA was unaffected by a dsbA mutation .
This observation suggested that the feedback regulation was acting between HilA and invF transcription .
However , HilA is known to directly activate invF transcription ( 3 ) , and our current understanding of SPI1 regulation could not account for this result .
To further determine where dsbA - mediated feedback regulation fits into the regulatory scheme , we constructed hilA - , invF - , sicA - , prgH - , and sopB - lacZ - transcriptional - fusions and integrated the fusion constructs into the Salmonella chromosome in single copy at the attachment site .
In contrast to strains used in our previous studies , the SPI1 locus is intact in these constructs .
HilA directly activates invF ( and sicA via VOL .

Data in panel C are shown as relative - galactosidase activity where the level of activity of each fusion in a wild - type background is considered 100 % .
This allows direct comparison of the two fusions .

readthrough ) and prgH , while InvF and SicA activate sicA and sopB .
We measured - galactosidase activity from these fusions in both wild - type and dsbA backgrounds .
Consistent with our previous data , deletion of dsbA significantly decreased the expression of invF and sopB ( Fig. 2A ) .
As expected , the dsbA mutation also reduced sicA expression in the same pattern as invF .
However , in contrast to our previous results , loss of DsbA also affected the transcription of hilA .
Consistent with the decreased expression of hilA , prgH transcription was also decreased in the dsbA mutation .
To further clarify this discrepancy , we directly compared the activity produced from our original hilA - lacZ fusion at the chromosomal locus [ ( hilAlac ) 112 ] compared to the newly constructed fusion integrated at the att site ( att : : pDX1 : : hilA - lacZ ) .
- Galactosidase activity was determined after overnight growth of isogenic dsbA and dsbA mutant strains in LB with 2 mM DTT ( see below ) .
As shown in Fig. 2B , only a low level of - galactosidase activity is produced from the original fusion .
The level of activity was slightly decreased ( 2 - fold ) in the dsbA mutant grown in the presence of DTT .
In contrast , the - galactosidase expression from the newly constructed fusion was much higher and loss of dsbA caused a significant ( 10 - fold ) decrease in expression .
The original hilA - lacZ fusion is a hilA null construct .
To ensure that HilA was not required for the observed phenotype , we deleted hilA in the newly constructed fusion background .
Consistent with recent reports ( 14 ) , deletion of hilA increased expression from the hilA promoter , but loss of DsbA led to a significant decrease in this background .
Thus , the low level of - galactosidase activity produced from our original fusion and the conditions ( see below ) under which we performed the experiment in our original report led us to conclude incorrectly that hilA transcription was unaffected in the dsbA background .
Taken together , our current data confirm that loss of DsbA leads to decreased transcription of the SPI1 genes but suggest that this potential feedback regulation feeds into the circuit upstream of HilA .
SPI1 responds to the disulfide bond status in the periplasm .
DsbA catalyzes disulfide bond formation in the periplasm and thereby facilitates protein folding .
To better understand the signals giving rise to the SPI1 regulatory phenotype , we examined the effects of environment and the roles of additional periplasmic proteins that control disulfide bond formation or general protein folding .
A phenotype similar to loss of DsbA could be achieved by the addition of 10 mM DTT to cell cultures ( data not shown ) , consistent with the hypothesis that loss of DsbA confers a phenotype due to a failure to form disulfide bonds .
Indeed , the addition of 2 mM DTT to LB medium significantly enhanced the dsbA phenotype while having only a minor effect on hilA transcription in a wild - type background ( data not shown ) .
It is known that free cystine in rich media can partially compensate for loss of DsbA ( 4 ) .
Based on these observations , we added 2 mM DTT to the cultures throughout our studies .
We asked if SrgA , an additional periplasmic disulfide bond oxidase encoded on the Salmonella virulence plasmid ( 6 ) , also affected SPI1 .
Deletion of srgA had no effect on expression of hilA or sopB , but a dsbA srgA double mutation had a stronger effect than the dsbA single mutation did ( Fig. 2C ) , suggesting that SrgA is additive to DsbA with respect to expression of SPI1 genes .
The cytoplasmic membrane protein DsbB reoxidizes DsbA ( 4 ) , whereas DsbC is a periplasmic protein disulfide bond isomerase that can reshuffle disulfide bonds ( 56 ) .
We tested whether these proteins also affected SPI1 regulation .
In the presence of 2 mM DTT , deletion of dsbB decreased transcription of the hilA - lacZ fusion to approximately the same extent as seen in a dsbA mutant background , consistent with the known role of DsbB .
In contrast , loss of DsbC led to a slight increase in hilA gene expression ( data not shown ) .
Thus , initial formation of disulfide bonds is apparently more important than isomerization of preexisting disulfide bonds in the SPI1 phenotype .
In E. coli , DsbA is primarily under the control of the twocomponent regulatory system CpxRA , which is activated by a variety of envelope stresses that cause protein misfolding in the periplasm ( 11 ) .
In serovar Typhimurium , dsbA is controlled by the hilA regulators RtsA , HilD , and HilC , and expression of DsbA under SPI1 - inducing conditions is independent of CpxRA ( 18 ) .
We asked if the Cpx regulon had any role in the SPI1 phenotype conferred by loss of DsbA .
As shown in Fig. 2D , deletion of CpxRA only slightly affected hilA expression .
Moreover , the dsbA phenotype was evident in this background .
These results are consistent with the expression of dsbA being independent of CpxRA under these conditions .

Differential effects of dsbA and invG mutations on transcription of SPI1 genes .
Strains contained the promoter - lac fusions indicated below the graph and were otherwise wild type or contained a deletion of dsbA , invG , orinvG dsbA .
Data are shown as relative - galactosidase activities where the level of activity of each fusion in a wild - type background is considered 100 % .
This allows direct comparison of the fusions .
The strains used were JS749 to JS752 , JS754 to JS757 , and JS767 to JS774 .
The dsbA effect on hilA expression is dependent on both rcsBC and fliZ .
Strains contained the hilA - lacZ fusion with the indicated mutations .
The strains used were JS749 , JS754 , and JS775 to JS784 .
tion of OmpX , which can induce periplasmic stress by increasing activity of Sigma E ( 47 ) , also did not affect hilA expression ( data not shown ) .
The lack of a significant phenotype in the cpx mutant or under conditions that induce the Sigma E regulon suggests that the observed defect in the dsbA mutant is due directly to a lack of disulfide bond formation , rather than general protein misfolding in the periplasm .
Feedback inhibition is not dependent on the SPI1 secretion machine .
Our original hypothesis was that , in the absence of DsbA , the SPI1 apparatus was not assembled appropriately and this led to feedback inhibition at the transcriptional level ( 18 ) .
If true , then mutations that disrupt the secretion machinery should confer a phenotype similar to that conferred by a dsbA deletion .
It is not clear what , if any , defect in the secretion machinery is caused by loss of DsbA ( 48 ) .
Therefore , we constructed a series of in - frame deletions removing genes encoding various parts of the needle complex , all of which are required for secretion by the SPI1 apparatus ( 23 , 37 ) .
These included deletion of prgH through orgA , removing the inner membrane , periplasmic , and needle components of the apparatus ; deletion of invG , encoding the outer membrane secretin component of the machine ; deletion of invJ , whose homolog in the Shigella secretion apparatus , Spa32 , is a primary target of DsbA in that system ( 64 ) ; and deletion of invH , which encodes an outer membrane lipoprotein required for proper assembly of the InvG secretin ( 8 , 9 ) .
All of these deletions conferred essentially identical phenotypes .
The results for the invG deletion are detailed below .
The in - frame deletion of invG was introduced into strains containing hilA - , invF - , sicA - , or sopB - lacZ - fusions .
Deletion of invG had no significant effect on the transcription of hilA and invF ( Fig. 3 ) .
There was a slight decrease in sicA and sopB transcription in the invG mutant that could be due to SicAmediated secretion - dependent transcriptional regulation ( 12 ) .
However , introduction of the dsbA mutation into the invG mutant background resulted in the expected decrease in expression of hilA , invF , sicA , and sopB .
These results show that the feedback regulation conferred by loss of DsbA is not simply a result of either the physical absence or the dysfunction of the secretion machinery .
The DsbA effect is partially dependent on the RcsCDB system .
The inability to form disulfide bonds in the periplasm appears to activate the RcsCDB system ( 45 ) , which has been shown to repress expression of SPI1 ( 50 ) .
Indeed , dsbA srgA double mutants are mucoid ( data not shown ) , indicating that capsule synthesis genes , controlled by RcsCDB , are being transcribed .
We determined if the DsbA effect on SPI1 is mediated through the RcsCDB system .
As shown in Fig. 4 , in the wildtype background , hilA expression was reduced 8 - fold by loss of DsbA and 34 - fold by loss of both DsbA and SrgA .
Deletion of RcsBC caused an increase in hilA expression in an otherwise wild - type background .
Moreover , in the rcsBC background , deletion of dsbA reduced hilA expression only 3 - fold , while deletion of both dsbA and srgA showed a 15 - fold reduction .
These data suggest that the DsbA effect is partially dependent on the RcsCDB system but that additional factors also lead to decreased SPI1 expression in the dsbA mutant .
The DsbA effect is partially dependent on FliZ .
The interaction between the flagellar and SPI1 secretion systems is complex ( see Discussion ) .
An important link is FliZ , an enigmatic regulator expressed in an operon with fliA , encoding the class III - specific sigma factor .
Genetically , FliZ activates expression of hilA ( 33 , 44 ) and enhances class II flagellar gene expression ( 40 ) .
The DsbAB system is required for proper flagellar assembly in Escherichia coli ( 10 ) .
Figure 5 shows that FIG. 5 .

( C ) The hilA - lacZ fusion strains contained pWKS30 or pFliZ in the indicated backgrounds .
The strains used were JS800 , JS804 , and JS816 to JS825 .
loss of DsbA and SrgA in serovar Typhimurium leads to a severe motility defect .
We reasoned that the loss of DsbA leads to defective assembly of the flagellar apparatus and this could result in decreased expression of fliZ and , consequently , decreased expression of hilA .
This led us to test the role of FliZ in the DsbA effect .
Deletion of fliZ caused a slight motility phenotype ( Fig. 5 ) , consistent with its reported role in transcriptional activation of class II promoters ( 32 , 40 ) .
As shown in Fig. 4 , the fliZ deletion also reduced hilA expression 7 - fold .
However , in the absence of FliZ , hilA expression was reduced only 2 - fold in the dsbA mutant or dsbA srgA double mutant .
These data are highly reproducible and suggest that , like RcsCDB , FliZ is partially responsible for the DsbA effect on hilA expression .
We then asked if these two systems account for the entire effect on hilA expression by deleting both rcsBC and fliZ in the hilA - lac fusion strain .
In the double deletion background , expression of hilA was no longer affected by loss of DsbA and SrgA ( Fig. 4 ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that the DsbA effect on hilA expression is dependent on both the RcsCDB system and FliZ .
The fliZ gene is regulated in response to periplasmic disulfide bond status by both RcsCDB - dependent and - independent mechanisms .
Although the data in Fig. 4 suggest that RcsCDB and FliZ independently affect SPI1 expression in the dsbA mutant , this interpretation is complicated by the fact that RcsB and cofactor RcsA can negatively regulate the flagellar regulon ( including FliZ ) by binding directly to the flhDC promoter region ( 21 ) .
Indeed , the rcsBC mutation confers a phenotype in a motility assay , particularly if the cells are incubated for a relatively long time ( Fig. 5 ) .
We wanted to determine whether the RcsCDB repression of SPI1 in the dsbA mutant is partially mediated by FliZ .
As shown in Fig. 6A , we tested the effect of the dsbA mutation on expression of a fliZ - lac fusion .
Deletion of dsbA decreased fliZ expression 13 - fold .
Deletion of rcsBC caused a slight increase in fliZ transcription in the dsbA background and partially relieved the repression of fliZ in the dsbA deletion background .
However , a decrease in fliZ transcription caused by deletion of dsbA was still observed in the rcsBC background .
Thus , the regulatory effect on fliZ is partially dependent on the RcsCDB system , but additional factors also lead to decreased fliZ transcription in the dsbA mutant .
Regulation of hilA mirrors regulation of fliZ .
What is the mechanism of decreased fliZ transcription caused by loss of DsbA in the rcsBC background ?
Based on published data , we propose the following model .
The fliAZ operon is controlled by both class II and class III promoters ( 40 ) .
Loss of DsbA prevents proper assembly of the flagellar apparatus , at least affecting FlgI assembly and stability ( 10 , 30 ) .
Under these conditions , the anti - sigma factor FlgM should not be exported and should block class III transcription ( 36 , 51 ) and decrease FliZ expression .
If true , then disabling the flagellar apparatus should confer a phenotype similar to that conferred by a dsbA mutation .
To test this model , we deleted flgI .
Figure 5 shows that , as expected , the flgI mutant of serovar Typhimurium is completely nonmotile .
To distinguish phenotypes resulting from the loss of the flagellar apparatus from phenotypes resulting from other effects of dsbA , we specifically tested the effect of the flgI mutation on expression of fliZ - lacZ and hilA - lacZ - fusions .
Deletion of flgI decreased both fliZ and hilA expression , consistent with the above model , but not to the extent seen in the dsbA mutant ( Fig. 6B ) .
Knocking out both dsbA and flgI conferred a phenotype almost identical to that seen in the dsbA mutant .
We then asked if this additional effect of the dsbA mutation was dependent on RcsCDB .
As seen above , deletion of rcsBC caused an increase in fliZ expression , presumably from the class II promoter .
In the rcsBC background , however , the flgI mutation had little effect on fliZ - orhilA - lacZ transcription .
This result suggests that the increase in fliZ expression caused by loss of RcsCDB largely compensates for the decrease in expression caused by loss of the functional flagellar apparatus .
The data above suggest that , although loss of the flagellar apparatus can affect FliZ expression , it does not explain the 94 LIN ET AL. .
decrease in transcription observed in the rcsBC background when dsbA is also mutated .
Indeed , deletion of dsbA in the flgI rcsBC background led to a decrease in fliZ expression , albeit 2 - fold , and a slightly greater decrease in hilA transcription ( Fig. 6B ) .
It seems unlikely that the loss of DsbA confers a defect in the flagellar apparatus that is more severe than that conferred by deletion of flgI ( Fig. 5 ) .
Therefore , this result suggests that some regulatory circuit , in addition to RcsCDB , has a minor effect on expression of the flagellar regulon in response to disulfide bond formation .
Taken together , these results show that transcriptional regulation of fliZ in response to disulfide bond status in the periplasm is multifactorial and complex .
However , it is striking that hilA transcription closely mirrors fliZ expression , suggesting that the DsbA effect on SPI1 is largely mediated through FliZ .
DsbA can affect hilA expression independently of RcsCDB and the flagellar system .
Figure 6B shows that loss of DsbA led to a decrease in hilA expression in the flgI rcsBC mutant background that was slightly greater than the decrease in fliZ expression in this background .
It is possible that DsbA can affect the SPI1 regulatory circuit independently of RcsBDC and FliZ .
Note that this hypothesis is in apparent conflict with the results shown in Fig. 4 .
In the rcsBC fliZ mutant , loss of DsbA has no significant effect on hilA expression .
However , expression of hilA is low in this background and subtle effects on expression might be difficult to discern .
To test this idea , we introduced plasmid pWKS30 ( vector control ) and pFliZ into strains containing the hilA - lacZ fusion .
In the latter plasmid , fliZ is expressed from the lac promoter and should no longer be affected by DsbA .
As shown in Fig. 6C , production of FliZ from the plasmid increased expression of hilA approximately 6.7 - fold .
In this background , loss of DsbA decreased the expression of hilA 2.5 - fold ; expression was decreased 5.2 - fold in the dsbA srgA double mutant .
To test if this effect is solely dependent on RcsCDB , we tested the loss of dsbA srgA in an rcsBC strain containing the pFliZ plasmid .
Under these conditions , loss of DsbA and SrgA still led to a modest , yet obvious , twofold decrease in expression .
Quantitative PCR analysis showed that fliZ mRNA production from the plasmid was identical in the dsbA and dsbA mutant strains ( data not shown ) .
These results are consistent with those shown in Fig. 4 and show that the RcsCDB system can affect hilA expression independently of fliZ expression .
But these results also show that loss of DsbA and SrgA can slightly affect hilA expression independently of both FliZ and the RcsCDB system .
FliZ and RcsCDB function through HilD .
Our results prove that the transcriptional effect mediated by loss of DsbA is independent of the SPI1 secretion apparatus .
It follows that loss of DsbA must be affecting hilA transcription via the known SPI1 regulatory system .
We have recently shown that HilD , HilC , and RtsA act in a complex regulatory loop to control the transcription of the hilA gene .
Moreover , in every case where it has been explicitly tested , all known regulatory systems that affect SPI1 regulation do so through HilD ( 15 , 20 ) .
We asked if FliZ and RcsCDB also function through HilD to control SPI1 .
First , we introduced pFliZ or the vector control ( pWKS30 ) into hilA - lacZ fusion strains in which the chromosomal fliZ , hilD , hilC , orrtsA gene was deleted .
As shown in Fig. 7A , production of FliZ from the plasmid was fully able to complement the effect of a fliZ mutation on hilA expression FIG. 7 .
FliZ and RcsBC affect hilA expression through HilD .
( A ) The hilA - lacZ fusion strains with mutations indicated below the graph contained pWKS30 or pFliZ .
The strains used were JS798 to JS807 .
( B ) The hilA - lacZ fusion strains contained deletions of genes indicated below the graph .
The strains used were JS749 , JS778 , JS782 , JS792 , JS808 , and JS809 .
and induced transcription of hilA fivefold in an otherwise wildtype background .
Introduction of a hilD deletion into the hilAlacZ fusion strain resulted in the expected decrease in hilA expression .
Moreover , the presence of a hilD mutation blocked FliZ induction of hilA .
In contrast , neither RtsA nor HilC was required for FliZ induction of hilA expression , although the absolute level of expression was reduced in both mutant backgrounds , consistent with our model of SPI1 regulation ( 15 ) .
Thus , FliZ - mediated induction of hilA expression is through HilD , while RtsA and HilC act as amplifiers of the signal .
We then asked if the inhibition of hilA expression by RcsCDB also works through HilD .
As shown in Fig. 7B ( and above ) , deletion of rcsBC in the wild - type background caused an increase in hilA expression .
However , this effect was not evident in either the hilD or the fliZ background .
These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the RcsCDB effect on hilA expression also works through HilD , at least partially by affecting expression of fliZ .
DsbA is required for function of the SPI1 secretion apparatus .
Given that the DsbA effect is mediated through the SPI1 regulatory system and is apparently independent of the SPI1 T3SS apparatus itself , we considered the possibility that loss of DsbA has no effect on the apparatus per se but rather that the VOL .

Effect of a dsbA mutation on secretion of SopB into the culture supernatant .
Western blot analyses of whole - cell extracts ( top panels ) or culture supernatants ( bottom panels ) with anti - SopB antibody .
( A ) The strains were wild type ( WT ) or contained deletions of dsbA , invG , ordsbA invG as indicated above the lanes .
The strains used were 14028 ( wild type ) , JS326 , JS740 , and JS810 .
( B ) The strains are pLacY ( A177C ) araBAD araE araFGH and contain the pHilA plasmid and mutations indicated above the lanes .
The strains used were JS811 to JS813 .
Culture supernatants and whole - cell extracts were prepared as described in Materials and Methods .
Equivalent amounts of culture supernatant or whole - cell extract from each strain were separated by 7.5 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .
The resulting gels were blotted , and proteins were detected by using anti- SopB and horseradish peroxidase - labeled rabbit anti - mouse secondary antibody .
The bar graph shows the - galactosidase activity produced from a sopB - lacZ fusion in each of the strains assayed from an aliquot of each culture .
defect in SPI1 - mediated secretion observed in a dsbA mutant is solely due to a decrease in the synthesis of the machine components .
In order to test if loss of DsbA had a direct effect on the assembly or function of the apparatus , we contrived a situation in which the synthesis of the machine was independent of the normal signal transduction pathway .
To accomplish this , we first cloned hilA onto a pBAD vector under the control of an arabinose - dependent promoter .
To avoid the problem of nonuniform induction inherent in the arabinose system ( 49 , 59 ) , we constructed a Salmonella strain that had deletions of arabinose transporters ( araE araFGH ) and catabolic genes ( araBAD ) and contained a plasmid encoding a mutant LacY ( A177C ) that transports arabinose proportionally to the external concentration ( 49 ) .
Our background strain also contained a sopB - lac fusion integrated at the attachment site .
We could then delete hilD to disconnect SPI1 gene expression from the regulatory effects of removing DsbA or any other known regulatory system .
With the introduction of the pBADhilA plasmid , we titrated the arabinose concentration to achieve expression of the SPI1 system approximately equivalent to that observed in a wild - type strain under our normal inducing conditions , as monitored by expression of the sopBlac fusion ( Fig. 8 ) .
We monitored SPI1 - mediated secretion by Western blotting , using antibodies directed against the SopB effector protein .
In control experiments , we assayed the production and secretion of SopB from the wild - type strain , as well as dsbA , invG , and dsbA invG strains .
As expected , deletion of dsbA in the wild - type background decreased production of SopB and the protein was not secreted into the culture supernatant at detectable levels ( Fig. 8A ) .
The invG mutation completely blocked secretion of SopB into the supernatant while slightly affecting expression of SopB .
In the pBAD - hilA background described above , SodB was expressed and secreted normally .
Although there was some variability in the level of arabinose induction , deletion of hilD , as predicted , did not affect expression or secretion , given that hilA is controlled by arabinose .
Deletion of dsbA in this background now had no effect on production of SopB in whole - cell extracts .
However , secretion of SopB into the supernatant was significantly decreased in the dsbA strain ( Fig. 8B ) .
These data show that , independently of the transcriptional effect on the SPI1 regulatory circuit , loss of DsbA affects either the assembly or the function of the SPI1 secretion apparatus .
DISCUSSION The inability to form disulfide bonds in the periplasm affects the assembly of complex machinery in the cell envelope .
Indeed , loss of DsbA , the primary disulfide bond oxidase in the periplasm , has been shown to block type III secretion in serovar Typhimurium , S. flexneri , P. aeruginosa , and Y. pestis and motility in E. coli and serovar Typhimurium ( 10 , 18 , 28 , 34 , 48 , 64 ) ( Fig. 5 ) .
But does loss of function indicate a simple defect in assembly ?
Here we have shown that , in addition to a structural or functional defect conferred by mutations in dsbA , there is a distinct regulatory response .
The SPI1 T3SS regulatory circuit responds to the state of disulfide bonds in the periplasm and adjusts expression of the machine components .
Our results suggest that loss of DsbA affects SPI1 through four distinct yet overlapping pathways ( Fig. 1 ) .
First , DsbA inhibits activation of the RcsCDB system ( 45 ) .
Activation of RcsCDB in a dsbA mutant inhibits hilA expression ( 50 ) through HilD .
Activated RcsCDB also represses flhDC , encoding the master regulators of the flagellar regulon ( 21 ) .
This leads to decreased production of FliZ , which activates SPI1 ( 33 , 44 ) , also through HilD .
Thus , under conditions where disulfide bonds are not properly formed in the periplasm , activation of RcsCDB leads to decreased production of at least two complex machines , the flagellar apparatus and the SPI1 T3SS , that require assembly in the cell envelope .
Second , DsbA is required for proper assembly of the flagellar apparatus ; FlgI has been identified as at least one specific target ( 10 ) .
In the absence of a functional flagellar apparatus , the anti - sigma factor FlgM is not exported but rather binds the FliA sigma factor , preventing expression of class III flagellar genes ( 36 , 51 ) .
The fliAZ operon is controlled by both class II and class III flagellar promoters , and expression of this operon is significantly decreased in both dsbA and flgI mutant backgrounds .
Thus , in the dsbA background , fliZ expression from both the class II ( via RcsCDB ) and class III ( via FlgM ) promoters is decreased , resulting in decreased expression of the invasion genes .
Third , loss of DsbA leads to a slight decrease in fliZ expression independent of RcsCDB or the known flagellar feedback regulation , but this pathway seems relatively minor .
We presume that this regulation is through flhDC , which is subject to a variety of environmental inputs ( 55 ) .
Fourth , loss of DsbA causes a slight decrease in SPI1 expression that is independent of RcsBCD or FliZ , but again this effect is minor .
Indeed , our data point to FliZ as a primary link between expression of SPI1 and flagella .
A large number of regulatory systems and environmental signals have been implicated in SPI1 ( reviewed in reference 1 ) .
The results presented here are consistent with our current model in which HilD , HilC , and RtsA act in a complex regulatory loop to control the transcription of the hilA gene ( 15 ) .
Although in every case where it has been tested , the identified regulatory systems feed into SPI1 through HilD , the actual mechanism of regulation is understood in only a few instances and involves posttranslational blocking of HilD function ( 20 ) .
Our data ( not shown ) suggest that FliZ also acts posttranslationally to affect HilD function .
We do not mean to imply that FliZ is directly affecting HilD ; the actual mechanism will require further investigation .
The flhDC operon is also controlled by a number of other regulators including H - NS , cyclic AMP receptor protein , EnvZ/OmpR , QseBC , LrhA , and RcsCDB ( 55 ) .
Given our data , it seems likely that some of the signals that affect regulation of SPI1 could function , at least partially , by affecting FliZ production .
Similarly , RcsCDB responds to a number of stimuli , and it is not clear which of , and under what conditions , these various signals are most important ( reviewed in reference 45 ) .
However , our data are consistent with disulfide bond status being an important physiological signal for RcsCDB .
In conjunction with FliZ , RcsCDB could be the intermediate in the SPI1 response to a variety of environmental conditions .
We have shown that , in addition to regulatory feedback on transcription , DsbA is required for appropriate assembly or function of SPI1 .
However , the molecular requirement for DsbA is unclear .
None of the protein components of purified SPI1 needle complexes contain more than one cysteine residue ( 37 , 39 ) .
However , the mature InvH , which acts as the pilot protein for the secretin InvG ( 8 , 9 , 41 ) , does have two cysteine residues and is a likely candidate for the primary defect in the dsbA mutant .
All indications are that , under the conditions that we are examining , dsbA is primarily controlled by RtsA , HilC , and HilD ( 18 ) ; CpxRA , which controls dsbA in E. coli , seems irrelevant to either expression of dsbA or assembly and function of the SPI1 T3SS or flagella in serovar Typhimurium ( Fig. 2C ) .
Thus , coregulation of dsbA with hilA apparently ensures that periplasmic disulfide bond formation is not an issue when SPI1 is being expressed and assembled .
Our data suggest that FliZ plays a major role in the regulation of SPI1 in response to periplasmic disulfide bond status .
However , this is only one aspect of the complex regulatory interaction between the flagellar regulon and the invasion genes , and a number of regulators have been implicated in controlling both systems .
RcsCDB negatively regulates both systems ( 21 , 50 ) .
Likewise , FimZY , the regulator of type I fimbriae , has also been shown to negatively coregulate flagella and SPI1 ( 5 ) .
HilA negatively regulates itself ( 14 ) , although the mechanism is not clear .
A recent study suggests that HilA might also repress flhDC ( 62 ) .
In contrast , other systems differentially regulate the two machines .
RtsA activates hilA , whereas the coregulated protein , RtsB , represses flhDC ( 19 ) .
SirA ( indirectly via the CsrABC system [ 2 ] ) also activates SPI1 but represses flhDC ( 26 , 61 ) .
It is not clear why this relationship exists between flagellar and invasion systems , nor is it known under which natural conditions these various regulatory schemes become important .
In particular , we do not know the state of these various regulatory networks during Salmonella colonization of the intestine when SPI1 expression is necessary .
More studies are required to fully understand the physiological role of this complex relationship .
