Kim * and Stanley Falkow Microbiology and Immunology , Stanford University Medical Center , Stanford , California 94305 Survival and replication in the intracellular environment are critical components of the ability of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to establish systemic infection in the murine host .
Intracellular survival is mediated by a number of genetic loci , including Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) .
SPI2 is a 40 - kb locus encoding a type III secretion system that secretes effector molecules , which permits bacterial survival and replication in the intracellular environment of host cells .
A two - component regulatory system , ssrAB , is also encoded in SPI2 and controls expression of the secretion system and effectors .
While the environmental signals to which SPI2 responds in - vivo are not known , activation of expression is dependent on OmpR and can be stimulated in - vitro by chelation of cations or by a shift from rich to acidic minimal - medium .
In this work , we demonstrated that SPI2 activation is associated with OmpR in the phosphorylated form ( OmpR - P ) .
Mutations in envZ and ackA - pta , which disrupted two distinct sources of OmpR phosphorylation , indicated that SPI2 activation by chelators or a shift from rich to acidic minimal - medium is largely dependent on functional EnvZ .
In contrast , the PhoPQ pathway is not required for SPI2 activation in the presence of OmpR - P .
As in the case of in - vitro stimulation , SPI2 expression in macrophages correlates with the presence of OmpR - P .
Additionally , EnvZ , but not acetyl phosphate , is required for maximal expression of SPI2 in the intracellular environment , suggesting that the in - vitro SPI2 activation pathway is the same as that used in - vivo .

Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI2 ) is a 40 - kb locus required for systemic salmonellosis in mice ( 18 , 36 , 38 ) .
SPI2 encodes a two - component regulatory system ( SsrAB ) , structural components of a type III secretion system , secreted effector proteins which manipulate the intracellular host environment to allow bacterial persistence and replication , and chaperones which mediate secretion of the effectors .
Disruption of the SPI2 regulatory or secretory apparatus results in a dramatic decline in the ability of salmonellae to survive in the intracellular environment of host phagocytes ( 6 , 36 ) , which is a prerequisite for systemic infection ( 13 , 27 ) .
Accordingly , SPI2 deficiency leads to diminished virulence during systemic disease in a variety of hosts , including mice , chickens , and cows ( 4 , 18 , 21 , 36 , 38 , 47 ) , but not during noninvasive gastrointestinal colonization of cows ( 42 ) .
Whereas the role of SPI2 in pathogenesis is clear , the molecular mechanisms by which it enhances intracellular survival largely remain elusive .
A number of effector proteins , encoded both within and outside SPI2 , are secreted through the SPI2 secretion apparatus into the host cell during intracellular infection ( 46 ) , but their precise functions remain undefined .
SPI2 has been implicated in disruption of host processes , including modification of phagosomal trafficking , evasion of host - derived oxidative - stress , and induction of late - stage host cell cytotoxicity ( recently reviewed by Waterman and Holden [ 46 ] ) , but descriptions of molecular interactions of effectors with host proteins and/or molecular activities are limited .
Our understanding of the environmental signals and regulatory pathways that lead to SPI2 expression is likewise rudimentary .
SPI2 is known to be expressed by intracellular Salmonella but not by extracellular bacteria ( 6 , 12 , 16 , 45 ) , and in vitro conditions that promote expression have also been described .
Shifting bacteria from Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium to M9 pH 5 acidic minimal - medium is known to result in activation of several SPI2 promoters ( 25 ) and an increase in transcription of some SPI2 genes ( 9 ) .
Low osmolarity and an acidic pH have therefore been proposed to be the signals that activate SPI2 expression under these conditions .
Several groups have also reported upregulation of SPI2 in response to cation chelation when a variety of promoter - reporter fusions ( 51 ) , Western blots ( 8 ) , and transcript measurement ( 23 ) were used .
Magnesium has been proposed to regulate SPI2 ( 8 ) , although other workers have reported that SPI2 expression is independent of the magnesium concentration ( 16 , 25 , 32 ) .
Studies of pH as a signal suggest that acidic pH activates SPI2 ( 25 ) and alkaline - pH represses SPI2 ( 32 ) .
Bafilomycin , which inhibits acidification of the phagosome , also prevents intracellular SPI2 expression , but interpretation of these results is confounded by possible pleiotropic effects on other molecules , such as the divalent cation transporter Nramp1 ( 19 ) .
In addition , SPI2 expression has also been reported to be independent of an acidic pH in - vitro ( 2 ) , indicating that further examination of pH as a signal is necessary .
Other proposed signals include phosphate limitation ( 8 ) , a decrease in osmolarity ( 25 ) , iron limitation ( 51 ) , and calcium limitation ( 16 ) .
Upstream signals which activate SPI2 expression are known to be dependent on a functional OmpR protein in both intracellular and in - vitro medium shift conditions ( 25 ) .
OmpR is the response regulator in a two - component regulatory system in which the EnvZ sensor kinase and other molecules are used to detect and respond to the extracellular environment .
186 , 2004 SPI2 REGULATION 4695 phosphorylated in response to extracellular osmolarity , and the OmpC and OmpF porins are reciprocally regulated in response to the proportion of OmpR in the phosphorylated state ( 34 ) .
The cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ has been well characterized as a phosphodonor to OmpR in - vitro , and the location of the envZ gene in the same operon with ompR suggests that this phosphorelay interacts in - vivo .
However , some reports indicate that EnvZ is not required for OmpR phosphorylation in response to high - osmolarity ( 15 , 26 , 37 ) , suggesting that OmpR can be phosphorylated by sources other than EnvZ .
One known alternative phosphodonor for a number of response regulators , including OmpR , is the small metabolite acetyl phosphate .
Acetyl phosphate serves as an intermediate molecule in the intracellular balance between acetate and acetyl coenzyme A , which are substrates for the reactions catalyzed by acetate kinase ( ackA ) and phosphotransacetylase ( pta ) , respectively .
Acetyl phosphate can directly phosphorylate OmpR in - vitro ( 22 , 30 ) , and its ability to control expression of the OmpC and OmpF porins suggests that this phosphotransfer occurs in - vivo ( 30 ) .
EnvZ was previously reported to be required for intracellular expression of SPI2 ( 12 ) , but the role of acetyl phosphate in intracellular induction of SPI2 and the contributions of EnvZ and acetyl phosphate to in - vitro expression have not yet been examined .
In addition to being required for expression of SPI2 , OmpR has been shown to bind directly to the ssrA and ssrB promoters ( 12 , 25 ) , demonstrating that there is a direct role for OmpR in SPI2 regulation .
OmpR and OmpR - P exhibit different binding affinities for the ssrA promoter , as measured by fluorescence anisotropy ( 12 ) , suggesting that one form may be more active in activating transcription than the other .
Mutation of envZ eliminates SPI2 promoter activity ( 12 ) , suggesting that OmpR - P is the form which activates SPI2 expression , but high osmolarity ( which results in OmpR phosphorylation ) has also been reported to repress SPI2 expression ( 25 ) .
The phosphorylation state of OmpR during SPI2 activation therefore remains unclear .
Many tools have been developed during two decades of characterization of the EnvZ - OmpR phosphorelay , which is among the most extensively characterized bacterial two - component systems .
We employed a number of existing and newly developed genetic tools in order to elucidate upstream events in the SPI2 signaling cascade during in - vitro and in - vivo activating conditions .
We observed that SPI2 expression requires EnvZ but is independent of acetyl phosphate and PhoPQ under all activating conditions .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and media .
Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
LB , M9 pH 7 , and M9 pH 5 media were prepared as previously described ( 9 , 25 ) .
Publicly available data were downloaded from the Stanford Microarray Database ( 17 , 39 ) with a 60 % good data filter and a channel 1 signal intensity greater than 150 .
The data were analyzed with Significance Analysis for Microarrays ( SAM ) ( 43 ) , version 1.21 , as a Microsoft Excel plug - in .
Significant genes were retrieved from SAM by using SAMster ( 33 ) .
Lexical analysis was performed on the significant gene list by using LACK as previously described ( 23 ) .
Correction of the pFMI10 ( mig - 10 ) sequence .
In order to determine the promoter region contained in pFMI10 ( 45 ) for cloning into the lacZ reporter vector pCK52 , we performed sequencing on the insert region of pFMI10 .
The sequence obtained corresponds to coordinates 1488910 to 1489707 of the sequenced LT2 chromosome ( 31 ) .
These coordinates represent the beginning - middle of sseG to the middle - end of ssaG .
The insert in pFMI10 was previously reported to be the ssaH promoter ( 9 , 24 , 25 , 45 ) , but given the location of the sequenced region , it is more likely an ssaG promoter fusion .
The construct is referred to as such below .
Green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) assay of SPI2 induction .
Increased expression of the ssaG - gfp promoter fusion was induced by a shift from LB - medium to M9 pH 5 medium as previously described ( 25 ) .
Briefly , overnight LB - medium cultures were diluted 1:50 into LB - medium with appropriate antibiotics .
The bacteria were grown with agitation for 2.5 h and washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline before resuspension in M9 pH 5 medium for 4 h. Chelator inductions were conducted in an identical fashion except that resuspension was in LB - medium or M9 medium with a chelator .
2,2 - Dipyridyl ( DP ) ( Sigma D7505 ) , EDTA , trans - 1,2 - diaminocyclohexane - N , N , N , N - tetraacetic acid ( CDTA ) ( Sigma D1383 ) , diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ( DTPA ) ( Sigma D6518 ) , triethylenetetraminhexaacetic acid ( TTHA ) ( Sigma T7633 ) , N - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) ethylenediaminetriacetic acid ( HEDTA ) ( Sigma H8126 ) , and nitriloacetic acid ( NTA ) ( Sigma N7642 ) were used at the concentrations indicated below .
For tissue culture infections , 2.5 10 5 RAW264 .7 cells were seeded into 24 - well tissue culture dishes and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 .
Extracellular bacteria were removed by washing after 1hofinfection , and the medium was replaced every hour to limit replication of extracellular bacteria as previously described ( 24 ) .
The host cells were lysed at 4 h postinfection , and the collected bacteria were analyzed for levels of GFP expression .
GFP was measured as previously described ( 25 ) .
SPI2 was induced as described above , and GFP was quantitated with a FACS - calibur flow cytometer ( Becton Dickenson ) and CellQuest software .
Averages of the median fluorescence intensities of the replicates are reported below .
Cation rank score calculation .
SL1344/pFMI10 was treated as described above with CDTA , EDTA , DTPA , TTHA , HEDTA , and NTA at concentrations of 1.25 , 2.5 , 5 , and 10 mM .
For each concentration , the chelators were ordered with respect to the ability to induce the ssaG - gfp fusion , as measured by flow cytometry .
Pairwise comparisons of the rank of each chelator were compared to a similarly ranked list of the chelators ordered by the association constants ( K a ) for a given cation .
For every comparison in which the induction - based rankings matched the expected order based on Ka , a value of 1 was added to the overall score ( zero for incongruous order ) .
The 15 total possible pairwise comparisons were tallied to give the overall rank score for each cation at each concentration of chelator .
Construction of mutant strains .
Gene knockouts were constructed by using the approach and plasmids of Datsenko and Wanner ( 7 ) .
Deletion primers were generated for the entire genome of LT2 by using a Perl script ( available from us ) and are freely available at http://falkow.stanford.edu .
The primer sequences have also been made available by Robert Edwards in a Red Swap primer database , which is accessible at http://www.salmonella.org .
Deletions were generated in LT2/pKD46 , followed by P22 - mediated transduction to SL1344 .
Detailed protocols for these procedures are available at http://falkow.stanford.edu .
Construction of chromosomally integrated lacZ - fusions .
In order to construct chromosomally integrated promoter fusions which did not disrupt the primary locus , we designed an integration vector , pCK52 , based on the integration technique of Ellermeier et al. ( 11 ) .
Inverse PCR was used to amplify pCE37 ( 11 ) with restriction sites added between the Flp recombination target ( FRT ) site and the ribosome binding site of lacZ .
The rrn terminator of pKD13 ( 7 ) was PCR amplified and cloned into the introduced KpnI site between the FRT site and lacZ to obtain pCK52 .
Promoter regions of ssrA , ssaG , ompC , and ompF were PCR amplified and cloned into the BamHI - NheI sites of pCK52 .
CK5 was constructed by the gene knockout procedure of Datsenko and Wanner by using a pKD13 template .
The Kan r marker was removed by transformation with pCP20 ( 7 ) and antibiotic resistance screening to obtain CK500/pCP20 .
The promoter - lacZ constructs were integrated into the hisG : : FRT site of CK500 by using FLP recombinase - mediated integration as described by Ellermeier et al. ( 11 ) .
Taz expression and chemiluminescent LacZ activity measurement .
All experiments in which the Taz construct was used were conducted in M9 pH 7 medium .
Bacteria were grown for 4hinthepresence of 1 mM aspartate as indicated below .
LacZ activity was determined by using the Gal - Screen chemiluminescent substrate as previously described ( 24 ) .
At the time of harvest , the optical density at 630 nm was measured by using a Bio - Tek EL 311SX microplate reader , and this was followed by permeabilization with 5 l of chloroform and 5 l of 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate with vortexing .
Fifty microliters of the permeabilized solution was added to 50 l of freshly prepared Gal - Screen reagent ( Applied Biosystems ) in white 96 - well plates and incubated for 60 min at room temperature .
Luminescence was measured by using a Tropix TR717 microplate lumi - 4696 KIM AND FALKOW J. BACTERIOL .
All experiments were performed in triplicate , and means and standard errors are reported below .
RESULTS SPI2 expression increases in response to cation chelation .
We observed during studies of iron regulation in Salmonella that SPI2 mRNA abundance increases upon treatment with DP , a cation chelator which preferentially chelates iron ( 23 ) .
We previously reported that 8 of the top 256 genes induced by DP were SPI2 - related genes , and a lexical analysis with LACK determined that the genes were overrepresented with high significance ( 23 ) .
We reanalyzed these data using an updated version of SAM ( 43 ) and found three additional significantly upregulated genes ( ssaQ , ssaP , and ssaD ) in addition to the eight previously observed upregulated genes ( sseA , ssrB , ssrA , sscA , srfB , ssaQ , ssaB , and ssaC ) .
Moreover , the significance of overrepresentation of SPI2 genes in our data set was an order of magnitude greater when the updated software was used ( P 0.00038 versus the previously reported P 0.004 ) .
We confirmed the observed upregulation using previously characterized GFP reporter fusions to the promoter regions of ssrA , a SPI2 regulatory gene ( 6 ) , and ssaG , a SPI2 secretion system structural gene ( 45 ) previously reported to be ssaH ( see VOL .
Repression of SPI2 expression correlates with chelatormetal ion complex stability .
Salmonella containing an ssaG - gfp fusion was grown for 4hinM9glucose minimal - medium ( SPI2 repressing conditions ) , and this was followed by 4hoftreatment with 10 mM CDTA in the presence of different concentrations of metal salts .
Log K a values are indicated beneath the metals on the x axis .
We found that the anion did not appear to have an effect on ssaG expression [ chloride versus sulfate for Mg ( II ) and Mn ( II ) ] .
DP induces SPI2 promoter - gfp fusions .
GFP fusions to the ssrA ( A ) and ssaG ( B ) promoters showed increased activity upon treatment with 500 M DP in LB - medium ( light line ) compared to the activity in an untreated LB - medium control ( dark line ) .
( C ) Activities of the ssrA and ssaG promoters increase with increasing DP concentration .
We observed that treatment with DP increased GFP expression from these promoter fusions and that the response increased with chelation ( Fig. 1 ) .
The fusions were induced by chelators in both rich - medium ( LB - medium ) ( Fig. 1 ) and minimal - medium ( M9 medium ) ( data not shown ) , suggesting that cation chelation alone is sufficient for SPI2 expression in - vitro .
These results are in accord with reports that the cation chelators DP , EDTA , and EGTA induce SPI2 expression ( 8 , 23 , 51 ) .
Nature of the regulatory cation .
The specific cation ( s ) which regulates SPI2 has not been identified .
We initially employed the add - back experimental design ( 51 ) , in which specific metal salts are added to chelator - treated medium .
The rationale behind this design is that specific cations negate the effects of chelator treatment ( in our case SPI2 induction ) but that nonspecific cations do not .
We used a panel of metal salts to observe their abilities to repress ssaG - gfp expression during treatment of the bacteria with the chelator CDTA .
We observed that increasing concentrations of all metals tested repressed CDTA - induced ssaG expression ( Fig. 2 ) but that different metals repressed to different degrees [ Mg ( II ) was the weakest , and Pb ( II ) and Cu ( II ) were the strongest ] .
However , the degree of ssaG repression which we observed correlated strongly with the association constants of different repressing ions for the chelator ; ions with stronger affinities for CDTA repressed ssaG more strongly than ions with lower affinities .
This suggests that the degree of ssaG repression is more likely to reflect the stability of the cation - chelator complex than specific regulation by a particular cation .
Because of this limitation in the add - back experimental design , we employed a different approach to identify cations which regulate SPI2 .
The family of complexane - type chelators contains a number of chemically similar members , including the commonly used molecules EDTA and EGTA , with slightly different affinity profiles for different cations ( 5 ) .
In general , the difference in affinity between members of a given pair of complexanes for a cation is smaller than the difference in affinity of a single complexane for two different ions .
Because different complexanes generally have similar association constants for a given cation , nonspecific binding of metals to che - 4698 KIM AND FALKOW J. BACTERIOL .

The results for chelator concentrations of 2.5 , 5 , and 10 mM were identical and thus are reported together .
Regulation of porin and SPI2 genes in Salmonella by the hybrid sensor kinase Taz .
( A ) Taz regulation of porin genes behaves in Salmonella as it does in E. coli .
Treatment of wild - type Taz ( Taz wt ) with 1 mM aspartate increased ompC promoter activity , and there was a concomitant decrease in ompF promoter activity .
The reciprocal responses of the promoters were amplified upon regulation by the constitutively active superkinase T247R mutant of Taz ( Taz c ) .
( B ) Taz regulation of SPI2 .
The ssrA promoter was upregulated in the presence of aspartate or the superkinase , but these conditions were not sufficient for activation of expression from the ssaG promoter .
The error bars indicate standard errors ( n 3 ) , and the P values are the result of unpaired t tests assuming unequal variances .
lators should occur to similar degrees in comparisons of any given pair of complexanes , minimizing the affinity measurement problem of the add - back design .
In order to identify the cations that regulate SPI2 , we measured ssaG - gfp expression in response to a panel of complexanes at concentrations of 1.25 , 2.5 , 5 , and 10 mM .
We observed that EDTA , EGTA , and particularly CDTA showed strong induction of SPI2 , while HEDTA , TTHA , DTPA , and NTA showed little or no induction ( data not shown ) .
To identify the cations with the most dramatic SPI2 regulatory effects , we constructed a pairwise comparison matrix to compare observed induction of ssaG - gfp by different concentrations of chelators with previously measured K a values of the chelators for different cations ( 5 ) .
Based on the tabulated scores from the pairwise comparisons ( see Materials and Methods ) , we predicted that Ca ( II ) , Mg ( II ) , Co ( II ) , Mn ( II ) , and Ni ( II ) are the best candidates for SPI2 regulatory cations .
Cd ( II ) , Cu ( II ) , Fe ( III ) , Zn ( II ) , Ag ( I ) , Hg ( II ) , and Fe ( II ) are less likely to be involved in SPI2 regulation but had moderately high scores in our comparison , and Pb ( II ) is highly unlikely to be the cation to which SPI2 responds .
Because we expect that Pb ( II ) is unlikely to play a role in SPI2 regulation due to its relative absence in biological systems , these results support the biological relevance of our approach and also our assertion that the add - back design is not appropriate for identification of specific regulatory cations .
SPI2 expression correlates with OmpR in the phosphorylated state .
Previous work indicated that SPI2 was upregulated when bacteria were shifted from LB - medium to M9 pH 5 medium and that this upregulation was dependent on OmpR ( 25 ) .
Recently , Feng et al. reported that unphosphorylated OmpR and phosphorylated OmpR exhibit different binding affinities for the ssrA promoter region ( 12 ) , but the phosphorylation state of OmpR during SPI2 activation was not determined .
We employed the sensor kinase Taz in order to examine the role of OmpR phosphorylation in SPI2 regulation .
Taz is a hybrid molecule constructed from the periplasmic domain of the aspartate - responsive sensor kinase Tar and the cytoplasmic signaling domain of the sensor kinase EnvZ of E. coli .
Taz regulates its kinase activity in response to extracellular aspartate levels , which in turn modulate phosphorylation levels of OmpR ( 20 , 44 ) .
In order to confirm that the system behaves in Salmonella as it does in E. coli , we tested regulation of the ompC and ompF porin gene promoters of Salmonella by Taz of E. coli .
We observed that Taz activation reciprocally regulates expression of ompC and ompF as it does in E. coli ( 10 , 20 , 44 ) : addition of aspartate upregulates expression from the ompC promoter and downregulates expression from the ompF promoter ( Fig. 3A ) .
Moreover , the Taz ( T247R ) superkinase , which constitutively phosphorylates OmpR ( 10 , 20 ) , exhibits further elevated levels of ompC and repressed levels of ompF promoter activity but is unresponsive to aspartate , indicating that the system behaves in Salmonella as it does in E. coli .
We next used the Taz system to examine regulation of the VOL .
( A ) EnvZ is required for SPI2 induction by EDTA .
An envZ mutant exhibited basal levels of ssaG expression upon treatment with EDTA , in contrast to the wild type and an ackA - pta mutant , in which ssaG expression was increased upon treatment with EDTA .
( B ) EnvZ is required for medium shift control of ssaG .
Shifting wildtype Salmonella from a rich - medium ( LB - medium ) to an acidic minimal medium ( M9 pH 5 medium ) resulted in ssaG - gfp expression in wild - type and ackA - pta backgrounds but not in an envZ mutant .
SPI2 ssrA and ssaG promoters in response to different phosphorylation levels of OmpR .
We constructed fusions of the ssrA and ssaG promoters to lacZ and integrated them at the hisG locus of CK500 , a derivative of SL1344 .
Addition of aspartate increased expression of ssrA ( Fig. 3B ) , and the Taz ( T247R ) superkinase further increased expression of ssrA , indicating that ssrA was upregulated in the presence of OmpR - P .
In contrast , the ssaG promoter was not upregulated in response to aspartate or the superkinase .
This result indicates that OmpR - P is not sufficient for expression of ssaG under our assay conditions ( M9 pH 7 medium ) .
Additionally , because phosphorylated OmpR increased expression of ssrA , we inferred that ssrA expression alone is not sufficient for activation of the ssaG promoter .
Together with the observation that the SsrAB two - component system is required for activation of the ssaG promoter ( Fig. 4A ) ( 25 , 45 ) , these results suggest that SsrA may respond to pH at the posttranscriptional level in order to activate ssaG gene expression .
Expression of SPI2 in - vitro requires envZ but not ackA - pta .
SPI2 expression requires functional OmpR ( 12 , 16 , 25 ) .
OmpR is known to receive signals from at least three sources : the sensor kinase EnvZ ( 49 , 50 ) , the sensor kinase ArcB ( under anaerobic conditions ) ( 28 ) , and the metabolite acetyl phosphate ( 22 , 29 ) .
We were interested in determining if EnvZ and/or acetyl phosphate could serve as a phosphodonor to OmpR during chelator activation of SPI2 expression .
Deletion of the ackA and pta genes eliminates the pathways for generation of acetyl phosphate from acetate and acetyl coenzyme A , respectively , and thereby prevents synthesis of acetyl phosphate ( 30 ) .
We used mutants with deletions in envZ and the ackA - pta operon in order to eliminate EnvZ and acetyl phosphate phosphodonation to OmpR , respectively , and examined regulation of the SPI2 GFP fusions in these mutant backgrounds .
We observed that induction of an ssaG - gfp fusion by EDTA was greatly reduced in the envZ mutant ( Fig. 4A ) , indicating that EnvZ is necessary for induction of SPI2 expression by chelators .
This deficiency was not due to the mutant having increased susceptibility to EDTA because expression of a constitutive rpsM - gfp fusion in the envZ background was not affected by EDTA treatment ( data not shown ) .
In contrast to the envZ mutant , the ackA - pta mutant was not defective in ssaGgfp expression , indicating that acetyl phosphate is not required for SPI2 expression in the presence of EnvZ .
A double mutant having mutations in envZ and ackA - pta had induction properties similar to those of the envZ mutant , further demonstrating the importance of envZ in SPI2 activation .
As in medium shift ( 25 ) and macrophage induction ( 45 ) experiments , expression of ssaG in response to cation chelation is also dependent on a functional ssrAB ( Fig. 4A ) .
The ssrA - gfp fusion displayed a similar pattern of activity : induction by chelators was abolished in the envZ and envZ ackA - pta mutants but was not compromised in the ackA - pta mutant ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that EnvZ , but not acetyl phosphate , is required for SPI2 induction by chelator treatment .
SPI2 promoter fusions to GFP are upregulated ( 25 ) , and the abundance of SPI2 mRNA transcripts increases ( 9 ) , in response to a shift from LB - medium to M9 pH 5 medium .
We examined the role of EnvZ and acetyl phosphate in SPI2 expression under these inducing conditions .
As in the case of EDTA induction , we observed that EnvZ is required for induction of ssaG - gfp by medium shift ( Fig. 4B ) .
We again observed that the ssaG - gfp reporter exhibited no defect in activation in the ackA - pta background , demonstrating that the absence of acetyl phosphate does not have a significant effect on SPI2 induction by medium shift .
The envZ ackA - pta double mutant behaved like the envZ single mutant .
The ssrA - gfp fusion exhibited an expression pattern similar to that of the ssaG - gfp fusion ( data not shown ) .
These results confirm that EnvZ is required for activation of SPI2 by medium shift and that acetyl phosphate is not required .
PhoP is not required for activation of SPI2 in the presence of OmpR - P .
There have been conflicting reports regarding the role of PhoP in regulation of SPI2 ( 8 , 25 , 32 ) .
We observed that treatment with 12.5 mM EDTA induced ssaG - gfp expression in wild - type and fur mutant strains but not in ompR and phoP mutant strains ( data not shown ) .
However , phoP mutants were highly sensitive to treatment with EDTA compared to wild - 4700 KIM AND FALKOW J. BACTERIOL .
PhoP is not required for SPI2 induction in the presence of OmpR - P .
Taz regulation of a ssrA - lacZ fusion was identical in wildtype and phoP backgrounds .

type , fur , and ompR mutants ( data not shown ) and could therefore have been unresponsive due to toxicity rather than to genuine regulatory effects .
Because the Taz system can be used under conditions that do not cause any toxicity to a phoP mutant ( growth in M9 - minimal - medium at pH 7 ) , we utilized this system with the chromosomal ssrA - lacZ - fusions to examine the role of phoP in SPI2 regulation .
As previously observed , the ssrA - lacZ fusion exhibited increased expression in response to addition of aspartate and in the Taz ( T247R ) superkinase strain ( Fig. 3B and 5 ) .
An isogenic strain with a mutation in phoP was constructed and observed for Taz - dependent regulation of the ssrA promoter .
We observed almost identical behaviors with the wild - type and phoP mutant backgrounds with regard to aspartate and superkinase responsiveness ( Fig. 5 ) ( the Pearson correlation value was 0.994 for the four expression values for each strain ) , indicating that PhoP is not required for OmpR - dependent induction of ssrA expression .
Intracellular SPI2 expression correlates with phosphorylated OmpR and requires envZ .
SPI2 expression is essential for replication of Salmonella within mammalian macrophages ( 6 , 36 ) .
We therefore wished to determine the phosphorylation state of OmpR during persistence of Salmonella in the intracellular environment .
Feng et al. suggested that OmpR is phosphorylated intracellularly based on the observation that EnvZ mutants do not express SPI2 in the intracellular environment ( 12 ) .
Based on our evidence that SPI2 is activated primarily in response to phosphorylated OmpR in - vitro and numerous reports that SPI2 is expressed intracellularly , we expected that OmpR - P would be present during intracellular life .
We observed that in addition to the ssrA and ssaG promoters , the ompC promoter was active in the phagosomal environment ( Fig. 6A ) .
In contrast , the ompF promoter did not show a significant change in activity .
These data are consistent with increased levels of OmpR in the phosphorylated form during life in the intracellular environment .
Induction of SPI2 in the intracellular environment .
( A ) RAW264 .7 macrophage - like cells were infected for 4 h , and this was followed by lysis and a LacZ assay .
The SPI2 and ompC promoters exhibited significantly increased activity , while ompF did not , which correlated with the presence of OmpR - P .
( B ) EnvZ but not acetyl phosphate is required for full expression of ssaG - gfp in the intracellular environment .
The error bars indicate standard errors ( n 3 ) , and the P values are the result of unpaired t tests assuming unequal variances .
We were interested in determining the contributions of EnvZ and acetyl phosphate to the regulation of SPI2 expression in the intracellular environment .
As observed for the in vitro conditions , intracellular bacteria exhibited greater ssaGgfp expression than extracellular bacteria exhibited ( Fig. 6B ) .
An envZ mutant displayed basal levels of GFP in the intracellular environment , indicating that ssaG expression in the intracellular environment is dependent on EnvZ .
The ackA - pta mutant exhibited no defect in expression of ssaG - gfp in the intracellular environment , which is in accord with our in - vitro observations .
The envZ ackA - pta double mutant behaved like an envZ mutant , confirming that envZ is essential for SPI2 expression .
The decrease in intracellular expression in the envZ and envZ ackA - pta mutants was not due to a decrease in viability , as an rpsM - gfp fusion expressed high constitutive lev - VOL .

In addition , the ackA - pta mutant survived at least as well as the wild type in RAW264 .7 cells during the short times used in our assay ( data not shown ) .
These results are also recapitulated by the expression pattern displayed by the ssrA - gfp fusion ( data not shown ) .
We concluded that EnvZ , but not acetyl phosphate , is required for full expression of SPI2 during intracellular life .
DISCUSSION The SPI2 secretion system is known to be a critical component of Salmonella 's ability to survive and replicate within host cells .
Mutations in SPI2 components lead to dramatic decreases in fitness in tissue culture ( 6 , 36 ) and in host models of systemic disease ( 4 , 18 , 21 , 36 , 38 , 47 ) .
While the importance of SPI2 for bacterial survival within the murine host is undeniably clear , the mechanisms by which it leads to enhanced virulence are only beginning to be understood ( 46 ) .
Similarly , the precise signals and pathways through which SPI2 is activated upon entry into the intracellular environment are poorly characterized .
Because transcriptional responses are often linked to the functions of the genes within the regulon , a better understanding of SPI2 upstream and downstream signaling has the potential to provide insights into the mechanisms by which SPI2 manipulates the host environment , as well as the chemistry of the phagosomal environment .
We previously reported that SPI2 is significantly overrepresented in a set of genes that are upregulated in response to treatment with the cation chelator DP , as detected by microarray analysis ( 23 ) .
We confirmed that SPI2 expression is activated by DP treatment using GFP reporter fusions to a regulatory gene promoter ( ssrA ) and a structural gene promoter ( ssaG ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
Additionally , we observed that these responses are not specific to DP but are also induced by other cation chelators , such as EDTA , EGTA , and CDTA ( Table 2 and data not shown ) .
These results are in accord with the reports of Deiwick et al. ( 8 ) and Zaharik et al. ( 51 ) , who described SPI2 responses to 6 mM EGTA and 250 M DP treatment , respectively .
A number of investigators have examined the nature of the signal which regulates SPI2 , but the results have been conflicting .
Deiwick et al. reported dependence of SPI2 expression on Mg ( II ) ( 8 ) , but more recent results contradict the earlier observations ( 16 , 25 , 32 ) .
Zaharik et al. reported that Fe ( II ) was responsible for SPI2 regulation based on its ability to repress SPI2 induction by DP ( 51 ) .
We conducted a similar experiment using the chelator CDTA to induce SPI2 and various metal salts to repress expression .
Our data demonstrate that the degree of repression correlates well with the association constant for the cation - chelator complex , which is strong evidence that this experimental design measures complex stability rather than specific regulation by the cation ( Fig. 2 ) .
This is especially supported by the strong repression of SPI2 expression by Pb ( II ) , which we feel is unlikely to be a specific regulator of SPI2 expression due to the relative absence of Pb ( II ) in biological systems and our observation obtained with the panel of complexane chelators that Pb ( II ) is highly unlikely to regulate SPI2 expression ( Table 2 ) .
The ions tested by Zaharik et al. ( 51 ) also follow this trend ; Fe ( II ) repressed SPI2 expression more strongly than Mg ( II ) or Mn ( II ) repressed SPI2 expression , which is consistent with our expectations from the K a sof these cations with DP [ log K a ( Fe ) 9.55 , log K a ( Mg ) 0.5 , and log K a ( Mn ) 2.62 l ( 5 ) ] .
While it is still possible that iron plays a role in regulating SPI2 expression , our data indicate that there is not enough evidence to draw this conclusion and , moreover , that caution must be exercised in interpreting data obtained with the add - back experimental design .
The add - back experimental design and interpretation are fairly commonly employed .
For example , EGTA is often used as a calcium - specific chelator ( 8 ) , although it has a higher association constant with Fe ( III ) ( log K a 20.5 ) than with Ca ( II ) ( log K a 11.00 ) ( 5 ) .
The source of misinterpretation is presumably an inappropriate extension of the observation that EGTA has a higher affinity for Ca ( II ) than other common chelators , such as EDTA ( log K a 10.96 ) , DTPA ( log K a 10.74 ) , and HEDTA ( log K a 8.14 ) , have and therefore chelates more Ca ( II ) at a given chelator concentration .
At this time it is not possible to eliminate the bioavailability of individual cation species , so better technical and/or creative methods are needed to precisely identify the cation ( s ) to which SPI2 gene expression responds .
We feel that our complexane - based prediction that Ca ( II ) , Mg ( II ) , Co ( II ) , Mn ( II ) , and/or Ni ( II ) regulates SPI2 ( Table 2 ) , while still only approximate , is the most accurate estimate to date .
We note that Garmendia et al. reported upregulation of SPI2 by an absence of Ca ( II ) ( 16 ) , which is consistent with our observations .
In addition to cation chelation , a shift from LB - medium to M9 pH 5 medium can also activate SPI2 promoter activity .
Lee et al. previously demonstrated that OmpR is required for the increase in SPI2 expression and that OmpR binds to the promoter region of ssrA , the regulatory sensor kinase of SPI2 ( 25 ) .
Feng et al. extended these findings by identifying additional OmpR binding sites and demonstrating that OmpR - P binds the ssrA promoter region with higher affinity than OmpR ( 12 ) .
High osmolarity was reported to repress SPI2 expression , suggesting that OmpR - P represses SPI2 expression ( 25 ) , but Feng et al. recently suggested that OmpR - P activates SPI2 expression based on the observation that an EnvZ mutant does not express SPI2 in macrophages ( 12 ) .
In order to examine the role of OmpR phosphorylation in SPI2 regulation , we employed the well - characterized Taz hybrid sensor kinase , which phosphorylates OmpR in response to an increasing extracellular aspartate concentration ( 44 ) , and the Taz ( T247R ) mutant , which possesses constitutive kinase activity ( 10 , 20 ) .
In addition to properly regulating the ompC and ompF porins in Salmonella ( Fig. 3A ) , activating Taz kinase activity with aspartate upregulated expression of a chromosomally integrated ssrAlacZ fusion , suggesting that OmpR - P is the form which is required for SPI2 expression ( Fig. 3B ) .
Moreover , the Taz ( T247R ) superkinase strain further increased ssrA - lacZ expression , which is also consistent with the hypothesis that OmpR - P is the form which activates SPI2 expression .
These results provide positive evidence that is complementary to and in accord with speculation that OmpR - P activates SPI2 expression ( 12 ) .
We did not observe any evidence of SPI2 repression in our Taz experiments , but additional work is needed to resolve this possible regulatory function of OmpR - P .
While OmpR - P did activate ssrA expression , an ssaG - lacZ fusion was not coordinately upregulated with ssrA , indicating 4702 KIM AND FALKOW J. BACTERIOL .
that OmpR phosphorylation and expression of SsrA alone are insufficient for upregulation of downstream SPI2 genes ( Fig. 3B ) .
This observation indicates that an additional signal ( s ) which is not present in the Taz growth - conditions ( M9 pH 7 minimal - medium ) is necessary for the SsrAB phosphorelay to activate expression of downstream SPI2 genes .
Our observation that ssaG - gfp is upregulated in M9 pH 5 medium but not in M9 pH 7 medium suggests that pH may activate SsrAB at the posttranscriptional level .
However , we note that pH can not be the only signal for SsrAB activation because acidified LB medium is not sufficient to induce SPI2 expression ( 25 ; data not shown ) .
One interpretation of these observations is that SsrA regulation of other SPI2 genes requires both cation starvation and an acidic environment .
Other reports also support the hypothesis that there is a role for acid regulation of SPI2 ; bafilomycin treatment of macrophages , which disrupts acidification of the phagosome , is reported to abrogate expression of SPI2 ( 6 , 16 ) , and secretion of a number of effectors is reported to occur upon medium acidification in - vitro ( 2 , 35 ) .
However , other data indicate that acid does not play a role in regulation of SPI2 ; expression of the sseA and sseB SPI2 effectors is not upregulated by acid treatment ( 2 ) , and vacuole acidification is not required for intracellular replication in certain cell lines ( 41 ) .
Moreover , SPI2 expression can be induced in - vitro by cation chelation in the absence of acidification ( Fig. 4A ) .
Further work is clearly needed to determine whether environmental acidification is a relevant activator of SPI2 expression in vivo ( 41 ) .
An alternative possibility is that the signal is not acidification per se , but rather a pleiotropic effect of acidification , such as modulation of a host molecule such as Nramp1 ( 19 ) or alteration of cation solubility or bioavailability .
The host molecule Nramp1 transports cations out of the phagosome in a pH - dependent manner ( 19 ) and has been reported to affect SPI2 expression levels ( 51 ) , suggesting that cation starvation mediated by Nramp1 plays a role in SPI2 regulation during vacuolar life .
However , it is important to note that SPI2 is expressed at high levels and is active in Nramp1 - defective cells , such as the RAW264 .7 macrophage - like cell line ( 25 , 45 ) , and in Nramp1 - defective mice , such as BALB/c mice , indicating that Nramp1 can not be the major factor which regulates SPI2 expression in - vivo .
Finally , we propose the possibility that cation starvation coupled with acidification might lead to generalized activation of multiple two - component systems .
The observations that cations and acidic pH activate EnvZ - OmpR ( Fig. 4 ) , PhoQ - PhoP ( 1 ) , and possibly the SsrA - SsrB phosphorelays are in accord with this proposal .
Careful measurement of the intracellular chemistry of the phagosomal environment and detailed genetic studies are essential to distinguish between these possibilities .
OmpR can receive phosphorylation signals from at least three sources : the EnvZ sensor kinase ( 49 , 50 ) , the ArcB sensor kinase ( 28 ) , and the small molecule acetyl phosphate ( 22 , 29 ) .
We observed that EnvZ is required for full expression of SPI2 by all known activating signals , including chelators ( Fig. 4A ) , medium shift ( Fig. 4B ) , and the intracellular environment ( Fig. 6 ) ; the latter observation is also in accord with results reported by Feng et al. ( 12 ) .
In contrast , a mutant with a mutation in the ackA - pta loci , which results in acetyl phosphate deficiency ( 30 ) , has no defect in SPI2 expression during intracellular life or under in - vitro conditions .
These results indicate that while acetyl phosphate may play a role in porin regulation , it does not regulate SPI2 expression in the host environment , in contrast to EnvZ .
Moreover , our results indicate that the signaling pathways which induce SPI2 expression under the three known activating conditions are identical .
In a number of reports the authors have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the role of the PhoPQ two - component regulatory system in regulation of SPI2 .
Deiwick et al. concluded from an analysis of secreted SPI2 proteins that PhoPQ modulates SPI2 activation ( 8 ) .
Lee et al. observed that PhoPQ seemed to play a role in expression of SPI2 under magnesium limiting conditions but that PhoPQ was not required for SPI2 expression in RAW264 .7 macrophage - like cells ( 25 ) .
Using a luciferase reporter , Miao et al. observed that SPI2 expression was not affected by a constitutively phosphorylated PhoP in vitro or by a PhoP mutant in RAW264 .7 cells ( 32 ) .
On the phenotypic level , PhoPQ and SPI2 appear to contribute to systemic disease independently in mouse disease models ( 3 ) , suggesting that they act independent of one another .
Our results obtained by using the Taz system demonstrate that in the presence of OmpR - P , the PhoPQ regulatory system is not required for SPI2 expression ( Fig. 5 ) .
Although no instances have been reported , it is formally possible that PhoPQ could play a role in SPI2 regulation by modulating events upstream of OmpR .
However , most of the data reported to date indicate that PhoPQ is unlikely to play a direct role in the regulation of SPI2 .
Figure 7 shows a model of our current understanding of the SPI2 regulatory cascade .
The first level of SPI2 regulation involves the EnvZ - OmpR phosphorelay , which is typically described as an osmolarity - responsive two - component regulatory system .
While the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ can phosphorylate OmpR in - vitro ( 14 ) , a number of reports have demonstrated that porin regulation in - vivo occurs independent of the presence of EnvZ ( 15 , 26 , 37 ) , and thus the role of EnvZ in porin regulation by osmolarity , as well as the substrate ( s ) for EnvZ , remain unclear .
The dependence of SPI2 activation on EnvZ in response to the in - vitro and in - vivo conditions described here suggests that pH and cations should be examined as possible EnvZ substrates .
We noted that pH signaling to EnvZ requires at least one additional signal based on the observation that pH and a shift from LB - medium to M9 medium do not induce SPI2 alone but do induce SPI2 in combination .
Acetyl phosphate does not regulate SPI2 expression under our conditions , but its role in regulating porins ( 30 ) suggests that two separate signaling pathways ( acetyl phosphate and EnvZ ) may feed into OmpR as an intermediate and result in regulation of distinct groups of genes ( porins and SPI2 , respectively ) .
The majority of the data available also indicate that the PhoPQ phosphorelay is unlikely to be directly involved in SPI2 activation .
The SsrAB phosphorelay is the second level of regulation in the model ; our data suggest that SsrA expression is distinct from phosphorelay activity that leads to transcriptional activation of downstream genes , such as ssaG , indicating that SsrA requires an environmental signal to activate SsrB .
Because SsrA - based activation of SsrB presumably occurs in the in - vitro conditions which we examined ( based on upregulation of ssaG expression ) , we propose that cations and/or pH is likely to be involved in this step .
Finally , there has been only one study of VOL .
