The enzymes for this pathway are encoded in a small region ( minute 41 ) that includes the pdu operon ( controlling B 12 - dependent degradation of propanediol ) and the divergent cob operon ( controlling synthesis of cobalamin , B 12 ) .
Expression of both operons is induced by propanediol and globally controlled by the ArcA and Crp systems .
The region between the two operons encodes two proteins , PduF , a transporter of propanediol , and PocR , which mediates the induction of the regulon by propanediol .
Insertion mutations between the pdu and cob operons have been characterized , and their exact positions have been correlated with mutant phenotypes .
The region includes five promoters , four of which are controlled by the PocR protein and induced by propanediol .
The cob and pdu operons each have one regulated promoter ; the pduF gene is expressed from two regulated promoters ( P1 and P2 ) .
The P1 and P2 transcripts extend beyond pduF to include the pocR gene ; thus the PocR protein autoregulates its expression from these promoters .
The fifth promoter , P Poc , is adjacent to the pocR gene and associated with a Crp binding site .
We suggest that all global control of the regulon is exerted by regulating the level of PocR protein at the P1 , P2 , and P Poc promoters .
A putative binding site for the PocR protein has been identified by computer analysis .
Eight close matches to this proposed site were found in regions near the four promoters known to be regulated by PocR protein : P Pdu , P1 , P2 , and P Cob .
A three - state model is proposed in which the regulon uses all five of its promoters to control expression .
Salmonella typhimurium can use propanediol as a carbon and energy source via a pathway that requires cobalamin as a cofactor ( 18 , 34 ) .
The ability of salmonellae to use propanediol depends on the presence of oxygen and exogenous cobalamin , vitamin - B 12 .
This B 12 requirement reflects the fact that salmonellae synthesize cobalamin only in the absence - of - oxygen ( 19 ) .
Despite these paradoxical laboratory observations , the genetics and regulatory behavior of the relevant genes suggest that , in nature , salmonellae synthesize cobalamin primarily to support the degradation of propanediol .
The genes for propanediol degradation comprise an operon ( pdu ) which is located near a major cluster of B 12 - synthetic genes , the cob operon ( 20 , 28 ) .
These operons are transcribed divergently , and both are induced by propanediol and the positive regulatory protein PocR ( 6 , 27 ) .
Both operons are subject to global control by the ArcA/ArcB system , which senses anaerobic conditions , and by the Crp/cyclic AMP system which senses a shortage of carbon and energy ( 2 ) .
The region between the divergent pdu and cob operons is likely to include features important in the control of this regulon .
Genetic studies of this region defined the regulatory gene pocR ( 6 , 27 ) .
The nucleotide sequence of this region includes two open reading frames ( 11 ) .
One shows homology to the AraC family of regulatory proteins and is likely to encode the PocR regulatory protein ; the other gene , pduF , appears to encode a diffusion facilitator for propanediol ( 11 , 12 ) .
Here we correlate the phenotypes of insertion mutations lying between the pdu and cob operons with their genetic map positions and exact sites in the published sequence .
We report the mRNA start sites for four promoters : P Pdu , P Poc , and two promoters ( P1 and P2 ) for the pduF gene .
The mRNA start for the cob operon was determined previously ( 26 ) .
Evidence is presented that the two pduF promoters ( like the cob and pdu operons ) are regulated by the PocR protein and initiate transcripts that include the pocR gene .
A putative PocR binding site was identified by aligning promoters known to be controlled by the PocR protein .
These features are discussed in terms of a three - state model for the control of the regulon .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and strain construction .
The genotypes of bacterial strains are given in Table 1 .
All strains were derived from S. typhimurium LT2 .
A transposition - defective derivative of phage Mu ( MudJ ) was used to create lacZ operon fusions ( 8 ) .
The insertion elements Tn10dTc and Tn10dCm are transposition - defective derivatives of transposon Tn10 ( 13 , 35 ) .
For strain construction , transductional crosses were performed with the highfrequency generalized transducing mutant of phage P22 , HT105/1 int - 201 ( 29 ) .
To select drug - resistant transductants ( Tc r , Kn r , Cm r ) , cells and phage were mixed and incubated nonselectively for 30 to 60 min .
To remove phage , transductants were streaked on nonselective green indicator plates ( 9 ) .
Purified transductants were tested for phage sensitivity by cross - streaking with the P22 clearplaque mutant H5 .
Rich medium was Difco nutrient broth with 0.5 % NaCl .
Minimum medium ( NCE ) was E medium without citrate ( 5 ) .
Carbon sources and electron - acceptors were added at the following concentrations : glucose , 0.2 % for aerobic culture and 0.4 % for anaerobic culture ; pyruvate , 0.44 % ; fumarate , 0.32 % ; succinate , 1.0 % ; and propanediol , 0.2 % .
Antibiotics were added at the concentrations described previously ( 6 ) .
The chromogenic - galactosidase substrate X - Gal ( 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - - D - galactopyranoside ) was used at a final concentration of 40 mg/liter .
PCR and cycle sequencing .
Oligonucleotides used are listed in Table 2 .
The primers A - 1 and A - 2 are directed toward each other and flank a region that includes the pdu promoter and its upstream region .
The interval between the convergent primers F - 1 and F - 2 includes the pduF gene and its upstream promoter region .
The convergent R - 1 and R - 2 primer pair flanks the pocR gene .
Since the preceding intervals overlap , insertions at any position in the region can be detected .
The PCR mixtures contained reaction buffer ( Promega ) , deoxynucleoside triphosphates ( 0.2 mM for each nucleotide ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 , two primers ( 0.5 M ) , and Taq polymerase ( Promega ; 0.025 U / l ) ; the total volume was 50 l. Templates were either purified chromosomal DNA or cells taken directly from bacterial colonies .
The PCR was run for 30 cycles ; each cycle was 20 s at 94 C , 5401 5402 CHEN ET AL. .
Strains used in this study Genotype a These zeb numbers are original allele designations assigned to these pdu insertions ( 6 ) ; these mutations were renamed when they proved to affect the newly discovered pduF gene .
20sat55 C , and 2 min at 72 C .
The products of PCR were visualized on agarose gels ( 1 % ) by ethidium bromide staining .
Cycle sequencing was done with the fmol DNA sequencing system from Promega .
Templates were PCR - amplified DNA purified with the GIBCO BRL glass MAX spin cartridge system .
Primers were end labeled with [ - 32 P ] ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase .
The sequencing reaction mixtures were analyzed on 6 % acrylamide sequencing gels within 24 h. For each Tn10 insertion in a given region , four reactions were set up , each with a genomic primer at one side of the region and a Tn10 primer homologous to one end of the element .
Depending on the orientation of the Tn10 element , only two reaction mixtures were expected to yield a product .
As an example , mutant pduF354 gave PCR products in two sets of reactions ( with primer pair T - R and F - 1 and with primer pair T - L and F - 2 ) .
The three other Tn10 insertions in this region are all in an orientation opposite to that of mutant pduF354 since only reactions with oligonucleotide T - R and primer F - 2 and oligonucleotide T - L and primer F - 1 gave PCR products .
The approximate location of the insertions was deduced by the length of the PCR products .
For a Tn10 insertion between primers F - 1 and F - 2 ( separated by 1.5 kb ) , each amplified fragment should be 99 bases longer than the distance between primer F - 1 ( or F - 2 ) and the insertion site , since the 5 end of each Tn10 primer is located 99 bases within the element .
The insertion pduF351 : : MudJ was previously isolated and mapped between the pdu operon and the pocR gene , and its orientation was determined ( 6 ) .
The position of this insertion was identified by PCR with oligonucleotide primers MuL and MuR ( which correspond to the left and right ends of the Mu transposon ) in combination with the primers F - 1 and F - 2 ( Table 2 ) .
The precise position of the insertion was determined by sequencing , performed as described above .
Preparation of RNA for primer - extension .
Total RNA was isolated by the hot - phenol - extraction method ( 1 ) .
Cells were grown on minimal - medium with 1 % succinate and 0.2 % propanediol , sedimented by centrifugation , and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer ( 0.02 M sodium acetate [ pH 5.5 ] , 0.5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , and 1 mM EDTA ) before phenol extraction at 60 C. Primer extension reactions with reverse transcriptase were performed as described previously ( 31 ) .
The oligonucleotide primers used to identify transcriptional starts were 5 - GTT GCATAAAGACCTCGCATG - 3 for the pdu operon ; 5 - CACTATAAAAAGT GCCGCCTG - 3 for the pduF gene ; and 5 - CATGATAAAACCCCTCAGTTA ATT - 3 for the pocR gene .
Total RNA was isolated from S. typhimurium LT2 and from the his - cob deletion mutant CRR299 ( TT11855 ) , which showed no runoff product .
For strain LT2 , the intensity of the reverse transcript signal seen for RNA from a propanediol - induced culture was 8 - to 15 - fold higher than that for RNA from an uninduced culture .
The abundance of the pocR mRNA from cells grown aerobically in glucose was 6 - to 10 - fold higher than that of the other mRNAs of the pdu/cob regulon .
This is consistent with the finding that basal expression of a pocR - lac fusion is higher than that of fusions to the other transcripts studied here .
Assay of - galactosidase activity .
The growth - conditions ( both aerobic and anaerobic ) for cell cultures have been described previously ( 2 , 6 ) .
The assay of - galactosidase was by the method of Miller ( 23 ) , and activities are reported in Miller units .
To identify common sequence patterns that might represent binding sites for the PocR protein , computerized searches were performed with the Consensus program ( 16 , 17 ) .
Gaps were not permitted , but a variety of pattern widths were tested , as well as whether the binding sites were symmetric .
Multiple sites were allowed to occur within each region ( see Results ) .
Once putative sites were identified , they were converted to a specificity matrix ( 32 ) that was used to search the entire region for additional sites with the program PatSer .
The specificity matrix is determined by the following method .
The aligned sites give the frequency at which each base occurs at each position , f -LCB- b , i -RCB- .
The genome has an occurrence of each base of p -LCB- b -RCB- ( for S. typhimurium this is approximately 0.25 for each base ) .
The elements of the specificity matrix are log ( f -LCB- b , i -RCB- / p -LCB- b -RCB- ) .
These values are related to the log - likelihood of observ - Oligonucleotide TABLE 2 .

RESULTS Localization of insertion mutations between the pdu and cob operons ( the control region ) .
Four classes of insertion mutations have been found to affect the pdu/cob regulon ( 6 , 11 ) .
These mutations and their phenotypes are listed below in map order ( counterclockwise in the chromosome ) .
Mutations within the pdu operon cause a simple inability to degrade propanediol , which was scored as a failure to produce acid on MacConkey agar containing propanediol and B 12 ( 6 , 18 ) .
This gene was identified in the sequence of the control region as an open reading frame whose encoded amino acid sequence is 65 % identical to the sequence of the glycerol diffusion facilitator ( glpF ) ( 11 ) .
Mutations shown here to affect this gene have no growth phenotype but were located genetically within the region between the pdu operon and the pocR gene ( 6 ) .
Mutations mapping in this same general region are slightly impaired for the induction of the cob operon by propanediol ( 27 ) .
We designated this region of the sequence pduF in the belief that it encodes a diffusion facilitator for propanediol .
This assignment has been confirmed by direct assay ( 12 ) .
These mutations cause a defect in both cobalamin synthesis and propanediol degradation .
Mutants with this designation show a recessive defect in transcription of both the cob and pdu operons ( 6 , 27 ) .
This region of the sequence encodes a protein homologous to regulatory proteins of the AraC family ( 11 , 28 ) .
Mutations in the cob operon eliminate only the ability to synthesize cobalamin ( 19 , 20 ) .
This sequence of this operon has been reported previously ( 10 , 28 ) .
Some mutations in this region have been sequenced previously ( 3 , 24 ) .
While the phenotypes , general map positions , and DNA sequences have suggested the arrangement listed above , there has been no direct correlation of pdu , pduF , orpocR mutations with exact positions in the sequence .
We have identified such insertion sites .
Each insertion mutation affects the sequence at a position expected from the mutant phenotype .
The exact position of each insertion was determined by sequencing the ends of the PCR fragments as described in Materials and Methods .
Figure 1 shows the exact base - pair positions of Tn10 insertions .
For all Tn10 insertions , there is a 9 - bp direct repeat of the target sequence , with one copy at each end of the inserted material ; these show agreement with the Tn10 consensus target sequence ( 21 ) .
The positions of these insertions vis - à-vis other features of the region are summarized in Fig. 2A .
The four promoter - proximal pdu insertions are all located at the same site in the mRNA leader region 70 bp upstream of the pduA coding sequence and downstream of the mRNA start point ( see below ) .
Both orientations are represented .
This appears to be a hot spot for Tn10 insertion .
The target sequence at this site differs by only one base pair from the Tn10 target consensus ( 21 , 22 ) .
Four Tn10 insertions were localized in the pduF region .
One insertion is between promoters P1 and P2 ( pduF353 : : Tn10d Tc ) ; one insertion is between promoter P2 and the pduF coding sequence ( pduF354 : : Tn10dTc ) .
The remaining two insertions are in the pduF gene ( pduF352 : : Tn10dTc and pduF355 : : Tn10d Tc ) .
The pduF355 insertion was shown by PCR to affect the pduF coding sequence , but its exact nucleotide position was not determined .
The pocR insertion mutations , which cause a defect in the expression of both the cob and pdu operons , all affect the open reading frame whose inferred product is similar to that of the AraC regulatory protein , supporting the idea that these mutations eliminate the production of the positive activator of the cob/pdu regulon .
Determination of transcription start sites for the pdu operon , the pduF gene , and the pocR gene .
The 5 ends of transcripts originating in the control region were determined by primer - extension as described in Materials and Methods .
Results are depicted in Fig. 3 , and start sites are diagrammed in Fig. 2A .
( A ) Exact positions of promoters , insertions , and a putative terminator in the control region .
The letters C , B , and A in the pdu operon designate the first three genes .
Arrows represent transcript start sites .
Triangles marked with T or J are Tn10dTc or MudJ insertions , respectively .
The symbols ( A ) and ( B ) near Tn10 insertions indicate the orientation of the tetA gene in each Tn10 element ( clockwise and counterclockwise , respectively ) .
( B ) Putative binding sites for PocR and global regulatory proteins .
The banded rectangle indicates a putative hybrid Fnr - Crp binding site ; the black rectangle is an IHF binding site ; the white rectangle is the Crp binding site ; and ovals are putative pocR binding sites .
Darkly drawn ovals near the horizontal line are sites with a close match to the consensus ; lighter ovals farther from the line are sites with a weaker match to the consensus .
For the pdu operon , a single transcript start site is initiated with a G residue located 122 bp upstream of the pduA coding sequence .
There are two mRNA start sites for the pduF gene ; the P1 and P2 start sites are located 287 and 180 bp before the start site of the pduF coding sequence .
Only one transcription start site is found near the pocR gene ; this start site is located 50 bp before the start site of the pocR coding sequence .
Induction of the pduF gene by propanediol .
Expression of the pduF gene is induced by propanediol under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions ( Table 3 , line 1 ) .
Data on the behavior of a cob fusion are included for purposes of comparison ( Table 3 , line 2 ) .
The basal level of pduF : : lacZ transcription is higher during aerobic - growth - on - succinate or anaerobic - growth on pyruvate - fumarate than it is during aerobic - growth - on - glucose .
Maximal induction by propanediol was obtained under conditions of anaerobic respiration on pyruvate - fumarate .
This pattern of expression is very similar to that found previously for the cob and pdu operons and the pocR gene ( 2 , 6 ) .

b ND , not done .
c NG , no growth ; crp mutants can not use succinate as a sole carbon source .
With PD tion of the pduF gene by propanediol requires the PocR protein ( Table 3 , compare lines 3 and 4 ) .
The pduF354 : : Tn10dTc mutation ( between the P2 pduF promoter and the pduF coding sequence ) eliminates pduF expression ( Table 3 , line 5 ) .
This suggests that pduF transcription starts to the left of this point and is consistent with the identified P1 and P2 promoters being the biologically relevant promoters for the pduF gene .
The pduF353 : : Tn10dTc mutation ( between the P1 and the P2 pduF promoters ) should block the P1 transcript but allow transcription of the pduF gene from the P2 promoter .
This insertion leaves the pduF gene inducible but reduces the maximal expression level ; the residual induction , presumably from the P2 promoter , requires PocR protein ( Table 3 , lines 6 and 7 ) .
Thus , both the P1 and P2 promoters appear to contribute to pduF expression , and at least P2 is regulated by PocR protein .
Barring other effects of these Tn10dTc insertions , the control of P1 would be seen as the difference between values in Table 3 , line 1 ( with both P1 and P2 ) and those in line 4 ( with P2 alone ) .
These differences are small but suggest that promoter P1 ( like P2 ) may be controlled by the PocR protein .
Effect of the Arc and Crp global regulatory systems on expression of the pduF gene .
Previous studies have shown that two global regulatory systems ( Crp and Arc ) control the cob , pdu , and pocR transcripts ( 2 , 4 ) .
These two global control systems also affect expression of the pduF gene ( Table 3 , lines 8 to 11 ) .
When cells were grown aerobically on pyruvate , the arcA mutation caused a small reduction in the induced level of the pduF transcription , while a crp mutation caused a 15 - fold decrease ; this is expected since Crp is the major activator under aerobic conditions .
During anaerobic - growth - on - glucose , the arcA mutation strongly reduced the maximal induction level and a crp mutation had a smaller effect ( Table 3 , lines 9 and 10 ) ; this is consistent with ArcA acting without Crp under anaerobic conditions on a good carbon source and with both Crp and ArcA acting together during anaerobic - growth on poor carbon sources .
The arcA and crp mutations together essentially eliminate expression under all growth - conditions tested ( Table 3 , line 11 ) .
Thus , the maximal induction of the pduF gene ( like those of the pocR , cob , and pdu transcripts ) requires both the Arc and the Crp global systems .
We found previously that arc and crp mutations had additive effects on the induced expression level of the cob , pdu , and pocR genes during anaerobic respiration ( 2 ) .
This additive quality was not seen for the pduF gene ( described above ) ; the arcA mutation reduced expression fivefold , and the crp mutation decreased expression 45 - fold .
We believe that the behavior of pduF fusions is complex , because the P1 and P2 promoters normally contribute to the expression of PocR , the positive regulator .
This contribution is prevented by the polar effects of the pduF : : MudJ ( lac ) insertion used to monitor pduF transcription .
Thus , in the pduF fusion strains , the pocR gene is expressed only by its own promoter , P poc .
Evidence to support this is described below .
The large effect of the crp mutation seen above may reflect in part the effect of the Crp protein on the P poc promoter .
Evidence for transcription of pocR from pduF promoters ( P1 and P2 ) .
Insertion mutations in the pduF gene have previously been seen to reduce maximal induction of the cob operon ( 27 ) .
This effect could be due to the restricted transport of propanediol ( the lack of the PduF transporter ) .
Alternatively , the reduction could reflect a deficit in PocR protein caused by polar effects of the pduF insertion on the pocR gene .
The latter effect would be expected if some expression of pocR depended on transcripts that originated at the P1 and P2 promoters of the pduF gene .
A complementation test should distinguish between these two possibilities .
A simple transport defect should be corrected by supplying a wild - type copy of the pduF gene in trans .
However , the polar effect of a pduF insertion on the adjacent pocR gene should not be trans - correctable by a pduF allele .
This complementation test was made with strains containing a duplication of the region that includes the pduF , pocR , and cob promoters .
The genotype of the basic strain is diagrammed in Fig. 4 .
This strain carried a cob : : lac fusion at the duplication join point ; this fusion served as a reporter of operon expression ; each copy of the duplicated region included both the pduF gene and the pocR gene .
Starting with this strain , we could place a pduF insertion cis to either a pocR or a pocR mutant allele and we could provide a pduF allele in trans for the complementation test .
The cob operon expression in these strains is shown in Table 4 .
In Table 4 , it can be seen that cob operon induction was 5406 CHEN ET AL. .
The structure of duplication strains used in Table 4 .
The inverted triangle indicates a Mud : : lac insertion at the duplication join point ; this insertion creates a cob - lac operon fusion .
Dotted and dashed triangles indicate the position at which Tn10dTc insertions were placed in some strains .
Straight arrows indicate the direction and start of transcription .
Curved arrows indicate the position at which PocR acts to stimulate the cob operon .
Open rectangles delineate genes .
The PocR protein and propanediol are represented by shaded circles and smaller shaded cylinders , respectively .
Plus signs in circles indicate that PocR protein acts as a positive regulatory protein .
reduced by a pduF : : Tn10 insertion only if that insertion was placed cis to the only functional pocR gene ( Table 4 , last line ) .
Both a pocR insertion ( line 2 ) and a pduF insertion ( line 3 ) are fully recessive when tested individually , but they do not complement each other in the diploid ; this is expected if the pduF insertion caused a defect in the expression of the adjacent pocR allele .
The results suggest that a significant amount of pocR transcription is initiated at the P1 and/or P2 promoters .
Since these promoters are regulated by PocR ( see above ) , it seems likely that they are responsible for the autoinduction of pocR , which has been reported previously ( 6 ) .
Insertions within the P2 transcript eliminate autoinduction of PocR .
The previous results suggest that some transcripts of the pocR gene might originate at the P1 and P2 promoters of the pduF gene .
We tested this possibility in duplication merodiploids with a pocR : : lac fusion at the join point and with a second , wild - type pocR allele .
Insertions of Tn10 were placed downstream of the P1 or P2 promoters , either cis or trans to the pocR : : lac fusion .
The structure of these strains is shown in Fig. 5 , and the ability of the strains to control pocR transcription is shown in Table 5 .
In Table 5 , it can be seen that blocking both P1 and P2 transcripts with a Tn10 insertion , placed cis to the pocR reporter fusion , eliminated autoinduction but left considerable pocR gene expression , presumably from the P Poc promoter .
A smaller effect was seen for the cis Tn10 insertion that blocked only P1 .
The effect of Tn10 insertions placed in trans is probably due to a reduction in total PocR production .
These effects of pduF insertions on pocR expression can not be due to the impairment of propanediol transport , since all of these strains carry a functional pduF gene .
In these assays it should be noted that the uninduced levels of pocR gene expression are quite high , even in strains with a pduF insertion .
This suggests that the P Poc promoter is active but is not autoregulated .
Other results suggest that the P Poc promoter is stimulated by the Crp protein , which might explain the high basal levels of transcription under these growth - conditions .
In any case , the pocR gene is transcribed from three promoters , two of which ( P1 and P2 ) are subject to control by PocR protein .
Efforts to identify possible binding sites for PocR .
The data presented , with previously published data , suggest that four promoters are controlled by the PocR protein , the cob operon promoter , the pdu operon promoter , and the P1 and P2 promoters of the pduF gene ( 2 , 6 , 26 , 27 ) .
To identify potential binding sites for the PocR protein within the regulatory regions of the pdu and cob operons , we used the program Consensus ( 16 , 17 ) .
This program finds sites that , when aligned , have high information content values .
The search procedure is described in Materials and Methods .
Initially , we considered only two fragments of DNA , the intergenic region between the pduA and pduF genes , which includes the P pdu , P1 , and P2 promoters , and the region between the pocR and cbiA genes , which includes the P cob promoter .
We first tested sites in the size range of 15 to 25 bases , which did not require symmetry .
The most significant patterns were , in fact , approximately symmetric .
We then required symmetry and tested a wider range of site widths of up to 32 bases long .
It is common for prokaryotic regulatory proteins , including AraC , a homolog of PocR ( 11 ) , to be dimeric and to bind at long symmetrical sites .
In some analyses , we included the region immediately upstream of the pocR gene , even though there is no evidence that the PocR protein regulates its own synthesis from this closest promoter , P Poc .
In these latter analyses , we did not require that sites from the pocR region contribute to the aligned set of binding sites , but we allowed that to occur if it would increase the information content of the set .

pdu and cob operons .
Figure 2B presents the position of these sites vis - à-vis other features of the region .
Even when the P Poc region ( between the pduF and pocR genes ) was included in the analysis , the program found eight strong sites that occur only in the pduA - pduF and pocR - cbiA regulatory regions .
The former region contains five predicted sites , and the latter region contains three sites .
The most significant site width is 30 bases , with an information content of about 18 bits ( when corrected for the sample size ) .
This amount of information is fairly typical of sites for prokaryotic - positive regulatory proteins ( 30 ) .
The graph of information content versus base position within the site ( Fig. 6 ) indicates that , if these sites are correct , the PocR protein probably binds to three consecutive major grooves of binding site DNA , as was suggested for the homologous AraC protein ( 15 ) .
The scores for the eight strongest sites range from 24.6 to 29.8 .
In the entire 22 kb of known sequence of the cob/pdu regulon ( 11 , 28 ) , only two other sites have a score higher than 18 ; these are both within the pduA - pduF regulatory region and may be significant but weaker binding sites for the protein .
Average scores of random sequences are slightly less than 0 .
It is interesting that the region around the pocR promoter ( not known to be controlled by PocR protein ) has six fairly regularly spaced weak sites , with scores in the range of 13.0 to 15.6 .
The possible significance of these sites is discussed below .
DISCUSSION We have determined the positions of insertion mutations and transcript start points in the region between the pdu and cob operons .
The phenotype of each sequenced insertion mutation allows the assignment of a function to each open reading frame in this region .
The pdu operon , the cob operon and the pocR gene each have one transcriptional start site .
The pduF gene has two promoters .
We can not exclude the possibility that the runoff reverse transcripts seen are due to the processing of a longer mRNA or to secondary structures in mRNA that block reverse transcriptase .
However , we think it likely that the identified sites represent message start sites , since each site is found near sequences with strong similarities to sigma - 70 promoters and because genetic data indicate the existence of a promoter in the general region of each identified site .
Data presented here suggest that significant transcription of pocR is initiated at the sites of the P1 and P2 promoters and extends across the pduF and pocR genes .
This was surprising , since the region immediately downstream of the pduF gene includes a stem - loop structure resembling a Rho - independent message termination site ( 11 ) .
The results presented here suggest that this stem - loop is not a transcription terminator or that it causes only incomplete termination under the growth - conditions tested .
The existence of the pduF gene was first inferred from sequence data ( 11 ) , and its function ( propanediol transport ) was initially assigned on the basis of its close similarity to the GlpF protein , which facilitates the diffusion of glycerol ( 14 , 33 ) .
We have recently shown directly that a pduF mutation reduces but does not eliminate propanediol entry ( 12 ) .
Apparently , these alternative means of uptake are strong enough that pduF mutants show no growth phenotype attributable to the transport deficit .
Some insertions in the general region between the pdu and cob operons were found to reduce the maximum induction of cob - lac or pdu - lac fusions by about twofold ( 27 ) .
Evidence presented here suggests that this defect is due to the impaired expression of the positive regulatory protein PocR .
We conclude that the P1 and P2 transcripts contribute to pocR expression and that pduF insertions reduce the level of PocR protein .
A predicted binding site for PocR protein was identified by the alignment of the regions near each of the promoters known to be controlled by PocR protein .
Eight strong matches to this sequence were found , five between the pduA and pduF genes and three immediately upstream of the cob promoter .
Weaker matches to this sequence were also found , including six closely spaced copies immediately upstream of the pocR gene ( Fig. 2B ) .
While we can not be certain that these sites are all significant , many are in positions appropriate for the activation or repression of transcription .
Computerized searches such as this can not replace direct binding studies , but it should be remembered that direct binding tests are informative only if they give positive results .
Many binding sites can be missed by direct assays if proper test conditions are not known ; binding sites are extremely difficult to identify by genetic analysis .
The computer searches suggest models that can be tested more directly and point out sites that should be scrutinized most carefully .
The site suggested for PocR binding has several features that are consistent with a role in regulation .
The site resembles that recognized by the AraC protein , a homolog of PocR .
Similarities include large size ( 30 bp ) , imperfect matches to the consensus , and three blocks of eight highly informative bases separated by three much less informative bases .
In the case of AraC , these eight - base blocks were suggested to represent regions of the major groove of DNA that are recognized by the protein .
It should be noted that later analyses of the AraC binding site suggest important asymmetrical aspects of this site ( 7 , 25 ) .
The positions of strong binding sites upstream of the cob promoter and near the P1 and P2 promoters of the pduF gene all seem reasonable for use by a transcription activator .

Predicted binding sites for the PocR protein .
The identified strong ( no. 1 through 8 ) and weak ( no. 9 and 10 ) sites are listed at the top with the positions of their 5 bases and their specificity matrix scores .
The binding sites near the P Poc promoter ( no. 11 through 16 ) are also listed .
Underlining of bases indicates matches to the consensus sequence .
In the middle of the figure , alignment of the two halves of the eight strongest sites is used to identify the consensus sequence .
Below is a graph of the information content of sites versus base positions in the proposed PocR binding site .
The height of a bar indicates how heavily this position contributed to an identification of the site .
ing of PocR protein to the two strong sites that flank the pdu message start point seems more likely to prevent transcription .
These sites may serve to allow maximal shutoff .
The IHF and Crp - Fnr sites near this promoter may also hinder the activity of the pdu promoter .
It seems likely that the activation of the pdu promoter is achieved with the weak site ( no. 9 ) and the strong site ( no. 3 ) slightly farther from the pdu promoter ( Fig. 2B ) .
Six weak matches to the predicted binding site for PocR protein were found near the P Poc promoter , which is not known to be controlled by PocR .
These weak sites might be populated , perhaps cooperatively , at a high concentration of PocR protein to limit its synthesis .
Alternatively , the PocR protein may have a slightly different binding site specificity in the absence of propanediol , and these sites could be the preferred binding sites in the absence of an inducer and serve to repress the pocR gene when its product is not needed .
We suggest a three - state model for control of the pdu/cob regulon .
This model provides a framework for thinking about the five promoters , the proposed PocR binding sites , and the available genetic data .
The model ( Fig. 7 ) accounts for most of the available data and makes many testable predictions .
We propose an off condition in which all the promoters are VOL .

inactive , except for a basal level of P Poc promoter activity .
The off condition might exist during aerobic - growth in glucose without inducer .
Under these conditions , the low basal level of the PocR protein may repress the expression of some promoters ( P pdu , P2 , and P Poc ) .
The second state ( standby ) would exist when cells grow without propanediol under global conditions that are appropriate for regulon expression ( e.g. , aerobic - growth on a poor carbon source or anaerobic respiration ) .
Under standby conditions , the P1 promoter is activated by IHF with Fnr or Crp proteins acting alternatively at their nearby binding site ; this binding occludes the pdu promoter .
The Crp protein also stimulates the pocR promoter , P Poc .
In the standby state , the active promoters ( P1 , P Poc ) express genes for the transporter ( PduF ) and positive regulator ( PocR ) , preparing cells to take up and respond to the inducer ( propanediol ) if it should appear .
( The propanediol `` antenna '' is up .
) When propanediol appears , the cell shifts to the on state .
The inducer enters and interacts with PocR protein to stimulate the P1 and P2 promoters , increasing inducer entry and induction capacity .
We propose that in the on state , Arc protein stimulates the P2 promoter and Crp stimulates the P Poc promoter ; thus these global controls would independently stimulate PocR production .
As the level of the PocR - propanediol complex increases , the divergent pdu and cob operons are induced .
Having separate pocR promoters activated by Arc or Crp would account for the additive effects of these global regulatory proteins on induced expression levels of the pdu , cob , and pocR transcripts ( 2 ) .
In the model , global regulators act directly only to increase the PocR level .
We propose that PocR protein ( with bound propanediol ) acts alone to activate the pdu and cob promoters .
