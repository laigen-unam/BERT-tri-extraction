GROISMAN * Department of Molecular Microbiology , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri 63110 The PhoP - PhoQ two - component system is essential for virulence in Salmonella typhimurium .
This system controls expression of some 40 different proteins , yet most PhoP - regulated genes remain unknown .
To identify PhoP - regulated genes , we isolated a library of 50,000 independent lac gene transcriptional - fusion strains and investigated whether production of - galactosidase was regulated by PhoP .
We recovered 47 lac gene fusions that were activated and 7 that were repressed when PhoP was expressed .
Analysis of 40 such fusions defined some 30 loci , including mgtA and mgtCB , which encode two of the three Mg 2 uptake systems of S. typhimurium ; ugd , encoding UDP - glucose dehydrogenase ; phoP , indicative that the phoPQ operon is autoregulated ; and an open reading frame encoding a protein with sequence similarity to VanX , a dipeptidase required for resistance to vancomycin .
Transcription of PhoP - activated genes was regulated by the levels of Mg 2 in a PhoP - dependent manner .
Strains with mutations in phoP or phoQ were defective for growth in low - Mg 2 media .
The mgtA and mgtCB mutants reached lower optical densities than the wild - type strain in low - Mg 2 liquid media but displayed normal growth on low - Mg 2 solid media .

PhoP - PhoQ is a two - component regulatory system that controls expression of several virulence properties in the gramnegative bacterium Salmonella typhimurium ( 13 , 31 , 32 ) .
The PhoQ protein is a sensor kinase that responds to changes in environmental magnesium concentration by modifying the ability of the PhoP protein to transcribe several genes ( 18 ) .
Virulence properties governed by the PhoP - PhoQ system include the ability to survive inside macrophages ( 14 ) , to resist killing by host defense antimicrobial peptides ( 13 , 22 , 23 ) , to withstand an acid - pH ( 15 ) , to invade epithelial cells ( 5 ) , to form spacious vacuoles ( 1 ) , and to alter antigen presentation ( 48 ) .
It has been estimated that PhoP controls expression of some 40 different proteins ( 32 ) .
However , only four PhoP - regulated loci have been characterized at the molecular level : phoN , which encodes a nonspecific acid phosphatase that localizes to the periplasmic space ( 24 , 28 ) ; pagC , which encodes an outer membrane protein necessary for intramacrophage survival ( 35 ) ; pagD , encoding an envelope protein with no apparent role in virulence ( 25 ) ; and prgHIJK , a PhoP - repressed operon encoding components of a secretion apparatus required for invasion of epithelial cells ( 5 , 34 ) .
While the PhoP - PhoQ system is essential for Salmonella pathogenicity , there are two lines of evidence suggesting that this system is also required in environments encountered outside animal hosts .
First , phoP homologs have been found in Escherichia coli and other bacterial species which are normally nonpathogenic ( 20 , 22 ) .
Second , the majority of PhoP - regulated loci identified to date , including some which are Salmonella specific , are not required to cause a lethal infection in mice ( 17 , 21 ) .
In this paper , we report the identification and characterization of a novel set of PhoP - regulated loci .
We demonstrate that magnesium is the signal that controls transcription of the PhoP regulon , and we establish that different sets of PhoP - activated genes are required for growth in solid and liquid magnesiumlimiting environments .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth - conditions .
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Bacteria were grown at 37 C in Luria broth ( LB ) ( 30 ) or in N - minimal - medium containing 0.1 % Casamino Acids , 38 mM glycerol , and 10 M or 10 mM MgCl 2 ( 41 ) .
N - minimal - medium -- agarose plates were prepared as indicated previously ( 18 ) .
Ampicillin and kanamycin were each used at 50 g/ml .
5 - Bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - - D - galactopyranoside ( X - Gal ) and isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) were used at final concentrations of 70 g/ml and 0.1 mM , respectively .
The ability of cells to grow in low - Mg 2 liquid media was evaluated as follows .
Overnight cultures grown in N - minimal - medium supplemented with 10 mM MgCl 2 were washed three times with Mg 2 - free medium and diluted to an optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of 0.010 in their respective culture media .
The OD 600 was determine at different times postinoculation .
To determine the number of CFU , cells diluted in cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) were spread on LB agar plates .

RESULTS Identification of PhoP - regulated genes .
The environmental signal controlling the PhoP - PhoQ system was unknown when we started our experiments .
Therefore , we searched for PhoPregulated genes by using a strategy based solely on the differential transcriptional activities of individual genes in the presence and absence of PhoP .
First , we constructed a strain ( MS7953s/pEG9014 ) harboring a Tn10 transposon insertion in the chromosomal copy of phoP and a plasmid with the wildtype phoP gene under control of the lac promoter .
Then , we mutagenized strain MS7953s/pEG9014 with MudJ , a derivative of bacteriophage Mu that harbors a gene conferring resistance to kanamycin and a promoterless lac operon for the generation of transcriptional - fusions ( 7 ) .
MudJ was delivered to MS7953s / pEG9014 by phage P22 - mediated transduction ( 26 ) , and kanamycin - resistant transductants were isolated on LB agar plates containing kanamycin and ampicillin .
Purified colonies were patched onto two LB agar plates containing kanamycin and X - Gal .
One of these plates also contained IPTG to promote phoP transcription from the lac promoter .
Clones displaying differences in - galactosidase activity between the two plates were candidates for harboring MudJ insertions in PhoPregulated genes .
We tested 50,000 mutants and found 54 that exhibited PhoPregulated expression of - galactosidase .
Forty - seven mutants displayed higher levels of - galactosidase when PhoP was induced and thus harbored insertions in PhoP - activated genes .
Seven mutants expressed lower levels of - galactosidase upon PhoP induction , indicating that they carried MudJ insertions in PhoP - repressed loci .
Phage P22 lysates were prepared in each of the 54 mutants , and MudJ was transduced into wild - type and phoP : : Tn10 strains .
We investigated the Lac phenotypes of the resulting isogenic strains by streaking them side by side on LB X - Gal plates ; in all mutants but one , Lac expression was PhoP regulated .
This experiment confirmed that the MudJ insertions were indeed in PhoP - regulated loci : PhoP had a regulatory effect not only when expressed from the lac promoter in plasmid pEG9014 but also when expressed from its own promoter in the chromosome .
The mutant that exhibited PhoP - regulated expression only when phoP was expressed from the plasmid harbored a MudJ insertion in the promoter region of the phoPQ operon , indicating that this locus is transcriptionally autoregulated ( 43 ) .

posed by Miller et al. [ 31 ] , who referred to PhoP - activated and - repressed genes as pag and prg , respectively .
We have used the prefixes pbg and pcg for PhoP - activated gene fusions and psg for PhoP - repressed fusions to prevent designation of different genes with the same name .
) Molecular characterization of PhoP - regulated loci .
To establish the identity of the PhoP - regulated loci , we cloned the DNA fragments harboring the junction between the left end of MudJ and the Salmonella chromosome for 40 mutants .
Then , we determined the nucleotide sequence of the region adjacent to the MudJ and used that sequence to search the sequence databases for related genes or proteins .
Eleven mutants harbored MudJ insertions in the mgtA gene , and one harbored MudJ insertions in the mgtCB locus ( Table 2 ) .
The mgtA and mgtB genes encode two of the three Mg 2 uptake systems of S. typhimurium ( 42 , 45 ) .
The mgtC gene , which precedes mgtB in the mgtCB operon , encodes a protein of unknown function that is not required for Mg 2 uptake ( 45 ) .
The discovery that two Mg 2 transporters are transcriptionally controlled by PhoP led to the identification of Mg 2 as the signal sensed by the PhoQ protein ( 18 ) .
One mutant harbored a MudJ insertion in an open reading frame encoding a protein homologous to the UDP - glucose dehydrogenase of Streptococcus pneumoniae ( 11 , 12 ) .
This gene , which we have designated ugd , is located 143 bp upstream of cld in the rfb gene cluster at the 44.9 - min region of the S. typhimurium chromosome .
We recovered a MudJ in a region that exhibits 85 % sequence identity with the E. coli mar locus ( 8 ) .
This locus comprises 27 putative genes and controls resistance to several antibiotics ( 19 ) .
However , the MudJ inserted between two open reading frames ( ORF180 and ORF66 in reference 8 ) whose role in antibiotic resistance has not been investigated .
We localized a MudJ insertion to an open reading frame encoding a protein with sequence similarity to VanX ( 36 ) .
The vanX gene , which is part of the enterococcal transposon Tn1546 , encodes a dipeptidase that is necessary for resistance to vancomycin .
Finally , two mutants harbored MudJ insertions at different positions of an open reading frame located 284 bp upstream of the nhoA gene of S. typhimurium .
Whereas nhoA encodes an N - hydroxyarylamine O - acetyltransferase ( 47 ) , the function of the PhoP - regulated open reading frame remains unknown .
Expression of PhoP - regulated genes in LB media .
To determine the magnitude of the PhoP regulatory effect , we examined the transcriptional activity of 30 different lac gene fusions to PhoP - regulated loci in isogenic wild - type and phoP strains .
We chose these 30 fusions because they represent different loci as determined by sequence analysis and/or map location in the chromosome .
The - galactosidase activity expressed by PhoPregulated genes ranged from 7 to 524 Miller units for PhoPactivated genes ( Fig. 1A ) and from 5 to 81 Miller units for PhoP - repressed loci ( Fig. 1B ) .
The ratio of - galactosidase activities between isogenic wild - type and phoP strains ranged from 4 to 100 ( median value of 19 ) for PhoP - activated genes ( Fig. 1A ) but was only 1.5 to 7 for PhoP - repressed loci ( Fig. 1B ) .
These experiments establish that the PhoP protein can regulate transcription over a wide range .
Mg 2 governs expression of the PhoP regulon .
We investigated whether the PhoP - regulated genes identified in our screening displayed the same regulatory behavior as mgtA and mgtCB , which are known to be transcriptionally activated under Mg 2 - limiting conditions ( 18 , 41 ) .
Except for pcgJ , all PhoP - activated genes were transcriptionally regulated by the concentration of Mg 2 in the medium ( Fig. 2 ) .
The ratio of - galactosidase activity for cells grown in defined medium with 10 M Mg 2 versus 10 mM Mg 2 ranged from 4 to 287 ( mean value of 81 ) .
The activation that results from Mg 2 limitation is PhoP dependent because it was not observed in isogenic FIG. 1 .
Transcriptional activities of PhoP - regulated genes .
- Galactosidase activities ( Miller units ) expressed by strains grown in LB broth were determined in mutants harboring a lac transcriptional - fusion to PhoP - activated genes ( A ) or to PhoP - repressed genes ( B ) .
Transcriptional activity was investigated in two different backgrounds , wild type and phoP .
The data correspond to mean values of at least three independent experiments done in duplicate .

Mg 2 controls expression of PhoP - activated genes .
- Galactosidase activity expressed by cells grown in N - minimal - medium with the addition of 10 M or 10 mM MgCl 2 was determined in strains harboring a lac transcriptional - fusion to PhoP - activated genes .
The transcriptional activity was investigated in two different backgrounds , wild type ( w - t ) and phoP .
Assays were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 .
Moreover , the - galactosidase activity displayed by isogenic phoP mutants ( grown in either 10 M or10 mM Mg 2 ) is similar to that exhibited by phoP cells grown in 10 mM Mg 2 .
These results demonstrate that Mg 2 limitation is the signal that induces transcription of PhoP - activated genes .
The psgB and psgD genes were chosen to investigate the regulatory effects of Mg 2 on PhoP - repressed loci because they displayed the highest ratio of expression between phoP and wild - type cells grown in LB broth ( Fig. 1B ) .
By definition , PhoP - repressed genes should be maximally expressed under conditions that result in minimal expression of PhoP - activated genes : either in the absence of PhoP or in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg 2 .
However , we did not find significant derepression of psgB or psgD when these mutants were grown in millimolar Mg 2 concentrations ( data not shown ) .
Different PhoP - activated genes are required for normal growth in solid and liquid low - Mg 2 media .
We have previously demonstrated that neither phoP nor phoQ mutants can form colonies on N - minimal - medium -- agarose plates containing 40 M Mg 2 ( 18 ) .
To identify the PhoP - regulated gene ( s ) responsible for this phenotype , we streaked individual mutants onto N - minimal - medium -- agarose plates containing different concentrations of Mg 2 .
Surprisingly , strains with mutations in either mgtA or mgtCB exhibited wild - type growth on low - Mg 2 media despite these genes encoding high - affinity magnesium transporters , and even a mutant with transposon insertions in both mgtA and mgtCB grew like the wild - type strain in low - Mg 2 media ( data not shown ) .
On the other hand , strains harboring mutations in either of six other PhoPactivated loci ( ugd , pbgE , pbgM , pbgN , pcgD , and pcgP ) could not form colonies on media containing 40 M Mg 2 .
However , these mutants grew better than the phoP strain when tested at higher Mg 2 concentrations ( Fig. 3 ) .
We noticed that phoP mutants reached a lower optical density than the wild - type strain when grown in micromolar concentrations of Mg 2 liquid media .
We investigated the behavior of the phoP mutant and established that its growth - rate was indistinguishable from that of the wild - type strain during logarithmic growth ( Fig. 4A ) .
However , at 10 h postinoculation , the OD 600 of the wild - type strain continued to increase but that of the phoP mutant reached a plateau and then decreased from a maximal value of 0.25 to 0.18 .
This defect was due to the low concentration of Mg 2 in the media because wild - type and phoP strains had identical growth phenotypes in 10 mM Mg 2 media ( Fig. 4B ) .
The growth defect displayed by the phoP mutant was not entirely surprising since we had previously shown that it could not form colonies in low - Mg 2 solid media .
However , all six PhoP - regulated genes that were essential to form colonies in low - Mg 2 solid media were dispensable for growth in low - Mg 2 liquid media ( Fig. 4A and data not shown ) .
On the other hand , strains with mutations in the mgtA or mgtCB locus ex - FIG. 3 .
Growth properties of mutants harboring insertions in PhoP - activated genes on low - Mg 2 solid media .
Bacterial strains ( wild type [ w - t ; 14028s ] , phoP [ MS7953s ] , ugd [ EG9524 ] , pbgE [ EG9230 ] , pbgM [ EG9238 ] , pbgP [ EG9241 ] , pcgD [ EG9277 ] , and pcgP [ EG9339 ] ) were streaked onto N - minimal - medium -- agarose plates , with the addition of MgCl 2 to a final concentration of 20 , 40 , 80 , 200 , or 400 M , and incubated at 37 C for 36 h before photography .
with mutations in either phoP , mgtA , ormgtCB were 10 to 20 times larger , with an average length between poles of 4.2 m ( ranging from 2.15 to 7.2 m for 59 cells examined ) .
A small percentage of the cells in the cultures of mgtA and mgtCB strains were very elongated , with lengths of up to 120 m ( data not shown ) .
These results show that the inability to express the Mg 2 transporters not only impairs growth in low - Mg 2 media but also affects the morphology of the cell .

The data correspond to a representative experiment performed in duplicate .
hibited a defective growth phenotype that was similar to that of the phoP mutant ( Fig. 4A ) .
( Because the MudJ insertion in mgtC is predicted to be polar on mgtB , the growth defect of the mgtC : : MudJ strain could be due to the absence of MgtC and/or MgtB .
) Taken together these results indicate that different subsets of PhoP - activated genes are required for growth in solid and liquid low - Mg 2 environments .
Mutants defective in phoP , mgtA , ormgtCB adopt an altered cell morphology in low - Mg 2 media .
We examined the viability of the phoP , mgtA , and mgtCB mutants when these cells reached stationary - phase in low ( 10 M ) - Mg 2 media .
At 15 h postinoculation , there was a significant decrease in the number of CFU for these mutants which was not reflected in the optical density of the cultures ( Table 3 ) .
At that time , the mutants lost the ability to form colonies but were still alive , as determined by a fluorescence - based cell viability assay .
The inability to give rise to colonies was associated with an altered cell morphology ( Fig. 5 ) .
Whereas the wild - type strain retained its characteristic rod shape with an average length between poles of 1.6 m ( ranging from 1.35 to 2.25 m for 42 cells examined ) , strains DISCUSSION The PhoP - PhoQ system was originally identified as necessary for expression of a nonspecific acid phosphatase ( 29 ) and was later shown to be essential for virulence in S. typhimurium ( 13 , 14 , 31 ) .
We have now established that PhoP - PhoQ governs expression of a large set of genes that are essential for growth in Mg 2 - limiting environments .
This conclusion is based on the following findings : ( i ) the concerted transcriptional regulation of 25 PhoP - activated genes by the Mg 2 levels in the growth media ; ( ii ) the identification of the Mg 2 transporter genes mgtA and mgtCB as PhoP regulated ; ( iii ) and the requirement for eight PhoP - activated loci for growth in low - Mg 2 media .
We have now established that transcription of 18 PhoPactivated genes is induced in micromolar Mg 2 concentrations and repressed in millimolar concentrations of this ion ( Fig. 2A ) .
These genes are in addition to the seven PhoP - activated genes that were previously shown to be transcriptionally regulated by the levels of extracellular Mg 2 ( 18 ) .
Several environmental conditions ( i.e. , oxygen levels , phosphate - starvation , and acid - pH ) had been shown to modulate expression of particular PhoP - regulated genes ( 2 , 5 , 6 , 20 ) .
However , none of these conditions controlled expression of the PhoP regulon in a concerted manner , like Mg 2 does .
For example , lowering the pH from 7.4 to 6.1 induces transcription of the psiD gene ( 18 ) but not that of the mgtA gene ( our unpublished results ) .
Likewise , growth in anaerobic conditions has opposite effects on different PhoP - repressed genes : it stimulates transcription of prgB but represses expression of prgH ( 5 ) .
Magnesium limitation induced transcription of PhoP - activated genes to different extents ( Fig. 2A ) , which could reflect differences in the PhoP - binding sites among PhoP - activated genes .
For example , the dissimilar expression of five PrfAregulated genes of Listeria monocytogenes has been attributed to the relative affinity of PrfA for its binding sites ( 39 ) .
Alternatively or in addition , expression of certain PhoP - activated genes may require a regulatory factor ( s ) besides PhoP .

Morphologies of Salmonella strains harboring mutations in the PhoP - controlled Mg 2 uptake systems .
Electron micrographs show negative - stained strains ( wild type [ 14028s ] , phoP [ MS7953s ] , mgtA [ EG9521 ] , and mgtCB [ EG9527 ] ) grown for 36 h in N - minimal liquid medium containing 10 M MgCl 2 at 37 C. Bars , 3 m .
The figure shows differences in size and morphology between the wild - type strain and strains with mutations in the genes encoding the transcriptional regulator PhoP or the Mg 2 transporter MgtA or MgtCB .
factor ( s ) could mediate the response to environmental conditions ( other than Mg 2 ) which are known to modulate transcription of particular PhoP - regulated genes .
Expression of the PhoP - activated pcgJ and of the PhoPrepressed psgB and psgD genes provided an interesting exception to the profile of most PhoP - activated loci : transcription of these genes was not regulated by the levels of Mg 2 in the media ( Fig. 2 ) .
PhoP was necessary for pcgJ transcription in LB broth ( Fig. 1 ) , and no pcgJ expression was detected in defined media , even in phoP cells ( Fig. 2A ) .
These results suggest that , in addition to PhoP , a component of LB ( or that is produced in LB ) is required for pcgJ expression .
On the other hand , transcription of the PhoP - repressed psgB and psgD genes could not be induced by growth at millimolar concentrations of Mg 2 .
This could be accounted for if this condition produced levels of PhoP that were sufficient to prevent transcription of PhoP - repressed loci but not to induce expression of PhoPactivated genes .
Consistent with Mg 2 deprivation being the signal that activates the PhoP - PhoQ system , the phoP and phoQ mutants are impaired for growth in low - Mg 2 media ( 18 ) .
We have now demonstrated that different subsets of PhoP - activated genes are required for growth in liquid and solid media .
Strains with mutations in either mgtA or mgtCB mimicked the behavior of phoP mutants in low - Mg 2 liquid media : normal logarithmic growth followed by an early onset of stationary - phase .
All three mutants lost the ability to form colonies once they reached stationary - phase ( Fig. 4 and Table 3 ) and adopted an altered cell morphology with single - cell sizes that were 10 to 20 times that of the wild - type strain ( Fig. 5 ) .
MgtA and MgtB are P - type ATPases that display 50 % amino - acid sequence identity ( 75 % similarity ) to each other ( 45 ) .
Given the ability of MgtA and MgtB to independently take up Mg 2 , it is not clear why mutations in just one of these transporters would result in a growth defect .
One possibility is that both MgtA and MgtB are necessary to maintain physiological levels of Mg 2 in the cytoplasm .
Alternatively , the growth defect may be due to the inability of these transporters to take up or export a ligand ( s ) that is cotransported along with Mg 2 .
Growth in low - Mg 2 solid media did not require mgtA or mgtCB but required a different subset of six PhoP - activated genes .
That these genes are dispensable for growth in low - Mg 2 liquid media suggests that they encode products that are likely to modify the surface ( rather than the cytoplasm ) of the microbial cell .
Indeed , one of these genes , ugd , encodes a protein that is homologous to the UDP - glucose dehydrogenase of Streptococcus pneumoniae , in which it is necessary for capsule biosynthesis ( 11 , 12 ) .
The ugd gene maps to one of the gene clusters required for lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) biosynthesis in S. typhimurium , E. coli , and Shigella flexneri ( 3 , 4 , 33 ) .
While ugd lies upstream of the cld gene , which controls the length of the O - antigen side chain , no differences have been detected between the LPS profiles of wild - type and phoP S. typhimurium ( 16 ) .
Thus , the nature of the surface modifica - 5098 SONCINI ET AL. .
tion ( s ) mediated by ugd gene product that allows growth in low - Mg 2 solid media is yet to be determined .
The remaining five genes which are essential for growth on low - Mg 2 solid media showed no sequence similarity to known genes .
While their nucleotide sequences and map positions indicate that they correspond to different loci , it is possible that they encode products that are part of the same complex or metabolic pathway that allows S. typhimurium to form colonies on low - Mg 2 environments .
Magnesium is necessary to stabilize the bacterial outer membrane by interacting with the phosphate groups in the LPS ( 9 ) .
In low - Mg 2 environments , charge repulsion between LPS molecules within a cell and between cells are predicted to increase ; thus , the PhoP - activated genes ugd , pbgE , pbgM , pbgN , pcgD , and pcgP may encode products that reduce these repulsive forces and allow the formation of bacterial colonies .
Examples of changes in the surface charge that modify cell - cell interaction have been found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( 40 ) .
The ability of S. cerevisiae to flocculate at the end of the fermentation process is due to an increase in both the cell surface hydrophobicity and the Ca 2 - mediated lectin - sugar binding sites ( 40 ) .
Another example of modification in cell - cell interaction has been found in neutrophils .
In these cells , repulsive forces driven by a negatively charged sialoprotein ( CD43 ) maintain neutrophils at a certain distance from each other in the blood flow .
The elimination of this charged protein from the surface of the cell , triggered by inflammatory signals , allows them to interact with each other resulting in adhesion to and migration through endothelial cells ( 36 ) .
The widespread phylogenetic distribution of the phoPQ genes in enteric bacteria ( 20 ) , including species which are normally nonpathogenic , suggests that the primary role of PhoP - PhoQ system is to mediate the adaptation to low - Mg 2 environments rather than virulence per se .
Indeed , the PhoPactivated genes mgtA and ugd , which are required for growth in low Mg 2 , are also present in the E. coli K - 12 genome .
