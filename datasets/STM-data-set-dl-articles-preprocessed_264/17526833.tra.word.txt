Microbiology ( 2007 ) , 153 , 1756 -- 1771 NsrR : a key regulator circumventing Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium oxidative and nitrosative - stress in - vitro and in IFN - c-stimulated J774 .2 macrophages Nicola J. Gilberthorpe , 1 Margaret E. Lee , 2 Tania M. Stevanin , 2 Robert C. Read 2 and Robert K. Poole 1 Correspondence Robert K. Poole r.poole@sheffield.ac.uk 1 Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology , University of Sheffield , Sheffield S10 2TN , UK 2 Academic Unit of Infection and Immunity , University of Sheffield Medical School , Royal Hallamshire Hospital , Sheffield S10 2RX , UK Revised 31 January 2007 Over the past decade , the flavohaemoglobin Hmp has emerged as the most significant nitric - oxide ( NO ) - detoxifying protein in many diverse micro - organisms , particularly pathogenic bacteria .
Its expression in enterobacteria is dramatically increased on exposure to NO and other agents of nitrosative - stress as a result of transcriptional regulation of hmp gene expression , mediated by ( at least ) four regulators .
One such regulator , NsrR , has recently been shown to be responsible for repression of hmp transcription in the absence of NO in Escherichia coli and Salmonella , but the roles of other members of this regulon in Salmonella , particularly in surviving nitrosative stresses in - vitro and in - vivo , have not been elucidated .
This paper demonstrates that an nsrR mutant of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium expresses high levels of Hmp both aerobically and anaerobically , exceeding those that can be elicited in - vitro by supplementing media with S - nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO ) .
Elevated transcription of ytfE , ygbA , hcp and hcp is also observed , but no evidence was obtained for tehAB upregulation .
The hyper - resistance to GSNO of an nsrR mutant is attributable solely to Hmp , since an nsrR hmp double mutant has a wild - type phenotype .
However , overexpression of NsrR - regulated genes other than hmp confers some resistance of respiratory oxygen consumption to NO .
The ability to enhance , by mutating NsrR , Hmp levels without recourse to exposure to nitrosative - stress was used to test the hypothesis that control of Hmp levels is required to avoid oxidative - stress , Hmp being a potent generator of superoxide .
Within IFN - c-stimulated J774 .2 macrophages , in which high levels of nitrite accumulated ( indicative of NO production ) an hmp mutant was severely compromised in survival .
Surprisingly , under these conditions , an nsrR mutant ( as well as an nsrR hmp double mutant ) was also disadvantaged relative to the wild - type bacteria , attributable to the combined oxidative effect of the macrophage oxidative burst and Hmp - generated superoxide .
This explanation is supported by the sensitivity in - vitro of an nsrR mutant to superoxide and peroxide .
Fur has recently been confirmed as a weak repressor of hmp transcription , and a fur mutant was also compromised for survival within macrophages even in the absence of elevated NO levels in non - stimulated macrophages .
The results indicate the critical role of Hmp in protection of Salmonella from nitrosative - stress within and outside macrophages , but also the key role of transcriptional regulation in tuning Hmp levels to prevent exacerbation of the oxidative - stress encountered in macrophages .

INTRODUCTION The ability of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) to survive and proliferate within innate immune cells such as macrophages is central to its capacity to cause disease .
The S. typhimurium genome encodes many mechanisms that allow resistance to the stressful 1756 - 2006/0037 31 G 2007 SGM Printed in Great Britain The NsrR regulon of Salmonella environment encountered within the macrophage .
Such stresses include the production by NAD ( P ) H oxidase ( Phox ) of superoxide anion ( O -LCB- : 2 ) and other reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , and by inducible nitric - oxide ( NO ) synthase ( iNOS ) of NO and other reactive - nitrogen - species ( RNS ) ( Vazquez - Torres & Fang , 2001a ; Fang , 2004 ) .
The production of ROS , particularly O -LCB- : 2 , in the univalent reduction of O 2 by Phox is often referred to as the oxidative burst , and is thought to be activated around 1 h after infection ( Tsolis et al. , 1995 ) .
On activation of the phagocyte by uptake of Salmonella , the membrane and cytosolic components assemble in the cytoplasmic membrane in a process involving phosphorylation and cytoskeletal elements ( Vazquez - Torres & Fang , 2001a ; Forman & Torres , 2002 ) .
The O -LCB- : 2 produced damages iron -- sulfur [ Fe -- S ] clusters and other targets ( Imlay , 2002 ) , whilst the hydrogen - peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) arising from O -LCB- : 2 dismutation oxidizes protein thiols and [ Fe -- S ] clusters and can create carbonyl and methionine - sulfoxide adducts in proteins , thiols and membranes ( Imlay , 2002 ) .
Furthermore , Fe ( II ) ( formed , for example , by the reduction of Fe ( III ) by O -LCB- : 2 anion ) reacts with H 2 O 2 to generate the hydroxyl radical , which is a sufficiently powerful oxidant to react with virtually all organic - molecules , including nucleic acids .
To protect against oxidative - stress , S. typhimurium possesses several antioxidant mechanisms ( Farr & Kogoma , 1991 ; Vazquez - Torres & Fang , 2001b ) that include not only superoxide dismutases ( SODs ) and hydroperoxidases , but also a type III secretory system that interferes with the trafficking of vesicles containing Phox to the phagosome ( Fang & Vazquez - Torres , 2002 ) .
The production of RNS by macrophages is mediated by iNOS ( Vazquez - Torres et al. , 2000 ) .
Nitric oxide synthases ( NOS ) produce NO by the oxidation of a nitrogen atom of L - arginine to NO , using O 2 and reducing equivalents provided by NAD ( P ) H as substrates .
iNOS , the form of NOS most associated with antimicrobial activity , is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level and can be stimulated by the presence of microbial products and cytokines such as TNFa , IL - 1 and IFN - c ( Vazquez - Torres et al. , 2000 ; Kalupahana et al. , 2005 ) .
Work by Chakravortty et al. ( 2002 ) demonstrated that the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI - 2 ) secretion system is able to interfere with the localization of iNOS and therefore aid avoidance of RNS .
The extensive increase in production of RNS by macrophages following infection , often called the nitrosative burst , is thought to begin at around 8 h after infection in mouse macrophages ( Eriksson et al. , 2003 ) , but may begin much earlier in human macrophages ( Stevanin et al. , 2002 ) .
The protein considered most important in the detoxification of NO by S. typhimurium in aerobic conditions is the flavohaemoglobin Hmp .
Flavohaemoglobins are the bestcharacterized class of microbial globin .
They comprise two domains , a globin domain with a non - covalently bound haem B and a flavin domain with recognizable binding sites for FAD and NAD ( P ) H ( Wu et al. , 2003 ) .
Hmp was first identified in Escherichia coli ( Vasudevan et al. , 1991 ) and now has a clearly defined role in NO biology in that organism : its synthesis is markedly upregulated by NO ( Poole et al. , 1996 ) , and hmp knockout mutants of E. coli and S. typhimurium are severely compromised for survival in the presence of NO in - vitro ( Crawford & Goldberg , 1998b ; Membrillo - Hernandez et al. , 1999 ) .
Salmonella Hmp has also been implicated in response to NO in human macrophages ( Stevanin et al. , 2002 ) .
In the presence of molecular O 2 , Hmp catalyses an oxygenase ( Gardner et al. , 1998 ) or denitrosylase ( Hausladen et al. , 1998 ) reaction in which NO is stoichiometrically converted to NO 3 ( Gardner et al. , 1998 ) , which is relatively innocuous .
Extensive studies of the purified protein ( e.g. Mills et al. , 2001 ) have revealed some details of the reaction mechanism .
Regulation of Hmp levels in response to NO and related species in E. coli is complex .
Control occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level and was shown in earlier studies to involve Fnr ( Poole et al. , 1996 ; Cruz - Ramos et al. , 2002 ) and MetR ( Membrillo - Hernandez et al. , 1998 ) .
Recent computational and experimental studies have also implicated NsrR [ product of the yjeB ( nsrR ) gene ] in hmp regulation ( Rodionov et al. , 2005 ; Bodenmiller & Spiro , 2006 ) .
NsrR is an NO - sensitive transcriptional regulator of hmp and other genes known to be involved in nitrosative stress tolerance .
It is a member of the Rrf2 family of transcriptional regulators , which also includes the IscR regulator that is involved in regulation of genes involved in [ Fe -- S ] cluster biogenesis ( Schwartz et al. , 2001 ) .
Based on the similarity of NsrR to IscR , which contains an [ Fe -- S ] cluster ( Schwartz et al. , 2001 ) , and other members of the Rrf2 family ( discussed in Rodionov et al. , 2005 ) , it has been suggested ( Bodenmiller & Spiro , 2006 ) that NsrR contains an NO - sensitive [ Fe -- S ] cluster .
Very recently , a similar conclusion has been reached for NsrR in Bacillus subtilis ( Nakano et al. , 2006 ) and a role for NsrR in S. typhimurium hmp regulation has been proposed ( Bang et al. , 2006 ) .
In Salmonella , the response of hmp transcription to O -LCB- : 2 ( generated by addition to cells of paraquat ) is mediated by a further regulator , RamA ( Hernandez - Urzua et al. , 2007 ) .
There has been some confusion over the possible role of the ferric uptake regulation ( Fur ) protein in hmp regulation .
Crawford & Goldberg ( 1998a ) proposed that the ironresponsive regulator , Fur , represses hmp transcription and that this repression is lifted by NO on inactivation of Fur .
Although these results have been retracted ( Crawford & Goldberg , 2006 ) , and others have suggested that Fur is not involved in Salmonella hmp expression ( Bang et al. , 2006 ) , other promoters including hmp are controlled by nitrosylation of the Fur iron ( D'Autreaux et al. , 2002 ) .
Furthermore , we have recently published evidence based on newly constructed hmp -- lacZ - fusions and immunoblotting that Fur is a repressor of hmp transcription in both E. coli and Salmonella , albeit a weak one ( Hernandez - Urzua et al. , 2007 ) .
Given the global importance of Fur in intracellular http://mic.sgmjournals.org 1757 N. J. Gilberthorpe and others iron management , a fur mutant of S. typhimurium might be compromised in its ability to resist killing within macrophages ; conversely the modest upregulation of Hmp in the absence of Fur might confer a selective advantage .
The main aim of this study was to investigate the roles of members of the NsrR regulon , including Hmp , in surviving nitrosative - stresses in - vitro and in - vivo .
The ability to enhance , by mutating NsrR , Hmp intrabacterial levels without recourse to exposure to nitrosative - stress also allowed us to test the hypothesis that NsrR plays a key role in tuning Hmp levels , since we have previously demonstrated that , in - vitro , Hmp is a potent generator of the products of partial oxygen reduction ( Membrillo - Hernandez et al. , 1996 ; Wu et al. , 2004 ) .
In this paper , we report roles in - vitro and in - vivo for components of the NsrR regulon in S. typhimurium determined by studying the phenotypes of nsrR and hmp mutants , and of an nsrR hmp double mutant in which all regulon components other than Hmp are upregulated .
We also re - examine the role of Fur and demonstrate that a fur mutant is compromised for survival within macrophages even in the absence of elevated NO levels in non - stimulated macrophages .
METHODS Bacterial strains , media and growth - conditions .
All studies were performed using wild - type Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028s or SL1344 and their isogenic derivatives ( Table 1 ) .
Bacteria were cultured at 37 uC , with cultures shaking at 220 r.p.m. , in LB broth ( Sambrook et al. , 1989 ) containing kanamycin ( final concentration , 50 mg ml 21 ) or chloramphenicol ( Cm ) ( final concentration , 25 mg ml 21 ) where appropriate .
Media were inoculated at 1 % ( v/v ) with an overnight culture unless stated otherwise .
For assessing the sensitivity of strains to methyl viologen ( paraquat ) , H 2 O 2 ( both from Sigma ) and S - nitrosoglutathione ( GSNO ) , antibiotics were omitted from media .
For assessing viability , cultures were spotted on nutrient agar ( Sigma ) containing the appropriate antibiotics .
GSNO was synthesized according to the method of Hart ( 1985 ) and kindly donated by M. N. Hughes , University College London , UK .
NO was synthesized according to the method in Poole et al. ( 1996 ) .
To assess sensitivity to GSNO ( 3 mM ) and paraquat ( 500 mM ) , growth curves were determined for cells grown in the absence or presence of the compounds in 10 ml LB in 250 ml flasks with side arms .
Growth was measured by culture turbidity using a Klett -- Summerson photoelectric colorimeter ( Klett Manufacturing Co. ) equipped with a no. 66 ( red ) filter .
For H 2 O 2 sensitivity assays , cultures were grown in 25 ml LB in 100 ml conical flasks for 3 h prior to addition of 5 mM H 2 O 2 .
Sensitivity to H 2 O 2 was determined by comparison of viable cell counts immediately prior to H 2 O 2 addition with those at 10 and 25 min following addition .
Viable counts were determined by conventional methods .
For Western blots , cells were grown as follows : anaerobic cultures were grown in six 8 ml glass tubes , filled to the brim with LB and sealed with Suba seals ( Fisher ) ; a glass ball in each tube facilitated resuspension of cells that had settled during static incubation .
Aerobically grown cells were grown in six 10 ml LB batches in 250 ml flasks with side - arm for each strain .
When the cultures reached midexponential phase ( 5 h anaerobic - growth and 3 h aerobic - growth , corresponding to Klett ~ 40 and ~ 80 , respectively ) , 1 mM GSNO ( final concentration ) was added to three of the tubes/flasks for each strain .
Anaerobic additions were made through the Suba seal using a Hamilton syringe .
Cells were incubated for a further 2 h before being pooled and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min , 4 uC .
Cells were stored as pellets at 220 uC .
Pelleted cells were washed in 1 ml 50 mM Tris / HCl ( pH 7.5 ) , centrifuged at 13 800 g for 3 min and resuspended in 1 ml 50 mM Tris/HCl ( pH 7.5 ) .
Over ice , each suspension was sonicated for 3630 s with 1 min rests , at an amplitude of 10 mm .
The disrupted cell suspension was centrifuged at 13 800 g and then the supernatant fractions were assayed for protein with the Bio - Rad protein assay kit and BSA as the standard .
A sample ( 10 mg protein ) of each sample was subjected to SDS - PAGE .
Anti - Hmp antibody ( Stevanin et al. , 2000 ) was diluted 2000 - fold for use with a 2000 - fold Table 1 .

Western blots were carried out as described by Renart & Sandoval ( 1984 ) ; detection was done by using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham Biosciences ) .
The l Red system was used to promote replacement ( first described in E. coli ; Murphy , 1998 ) of a large portion of the nsrR gene with a Cm resistance ( cat ) gene .
The cat gene from pACYC184 was PCR - amplified with primers having 40 bp of 59 and 39 flanking homology to the S. typhimurium nsrR gene .
The linear DNA fragment was electroporated into wild - type S. typhimurium carrying pTP223 and transformants selected on nutrient agar containing Cm ( final concentration 25 mg ml 21 ) .
Putative mutants were picked the following day and verified by PCR amplification of the nsrR region .
The mutation was transduced into a clean wild - type background using P22 ( Maloy et al. , 1996 ) , selecting for Cm R .
The wild - type nsrR gene was amplified with primers engineered with terminal cut sites for EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes ( at the 59 and 39 ends respectively ) .
The PCR product was digested with the enzymes overnight at room temperature .
pBR322 was simultaneously digested with the same enzymes at 4 uC .
The restricted fragment and plasmid were then ligated with T4 DNA ligase ( Promega ) , overnight at 4 uC .
Ligation mixture ( 10 ng DNA ) was used to transform competent DH5a cells ( Invitrogen ) and transformants were selected on nutrient agar containing 200 mg ampicillin ml 21 .
The recombinant plasmid was then reisolated using the Qiagen Qiaquick miniprep spin kit , and used to electroporate the mutant strain .
J774 .2 macrophage culture and infection .
Macrophages for infection with Salmonella were cultured for 3 days in 24 - well flatbottom plates ( 2610 5 cells per well ) in Dulbecco 's Modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) ( D5796 , Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , at 37 uC in a humidified atmosphere containing 95 % air/5 % CO 2 .
Where indicated , DMEM was supplemented with murine IFN - c ( RD Systems ; 1000 U ml 21 , final concentration ) approximately 9 h prior to infection .
For fluorescence microscopy , macrophages were cultured on sterile glass coverslips ( BDH ) .
Prior to infection , 12 ml LB was inoculated at 2 % with an overnight culture and cells incubated at 37 uC , shaking at 220 r.p.m. , for ~ 1.5 h or to an OD 600 of ~ 0.4 , measured using a Jenway 6100 spectrophotometer , in cuvettes with a pathlength of 1 cm .
Immediately prior to infection , bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 3 min at 13 800 g and washed in phosphate - buffered saline , pH 7.4 ( PBS ) .
Bacteria were finally resuspended in DMEM +10 % FCS to give the appropriate c.f.u. ml 21 , as determined by conventional methods .
Fluorescence microscopy was performed as described in Read et al. ( 1996 ) .
In brief , cells were fixed with 100 ml 2 % paraformaldehyde and stained using the nucleic acid stain 4,6 - diamidino - 2-phenylindole ( DAPI ) , followed by a solution containing rabbit anti - Salmonella O antibody ( Difco ) diluted 1 : 50 in PBS .
Cells were counterstained with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG antibody ( Difco ) , diluted 1 : 20 in PBS .
Coverslips were finally removed , dried , mounted in Vectashield ( Molecular Probes ) , and viewed at a magnification of 61000 in a DMRB 1000 fluorescence microscope ( Leica ) .
Internalization of bacteria was determined by subtracting the number of extracellular bacteria , identified by their co - localization with FITCconjugated antibody , from the total number of bacteria exhibiting the DAPI stain .
Assay of intracellular Salmonella viability .
Macrophages were infected with Salmonella at an m.o.i. of 11.25 or 7.5 , and incubated for 30 min at 37 uC in a humidified atmosphere ( 95 % air/5 % CO 2 ) to allow internalization .
Following incubation , wells were washed twice with PBS .
At the time of sampling , J774 .2 cells were lysed with 250 ml of 2 % sterile saponin for 20 min at 37 uC .
Lysates were collected and wells washed with PBS ( 750 ml ) to achieve maximum recovery of bacteria .
The first samples were taken 30 min after infection , including three uninfected wells , after which the DMEM in the remaining wells was replaced with fresh DMEM containing gentamicin ( 100 mg ml 21 ) and incubated for a further 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria .
The minimum bactericidal concentration for gentamicin of each strain was determined by conventional methods and was shown to be identical for all strains used .
Subsequently , the media containing gentamicin at 100 mg ml 21 were replaced with media containing gentamicin at 25 mg ml 21 and incubated until lysis with saponin as described above .
The cells were lysed at 30 min after initial infection , prior to gentamicin treatment , and at 4 , 15 and 21 h after initial infection .
All samples were taken in triplicate .
Bacterial viability was determined using standard dilution techniques .
Supernatants removed at 4 , 15 and 21 h were stored at 221 uC for later nitrite and nitrate analyses .
Minimum bactericidal concentration test .
Cells were grown and washed exactly as they would be prior to macrophage infection , except that resuspension was in DMEM that contained various concentrations of gentamicin , up to 200 mg ml 21 .
Cells were incubated for 30 min before harvest , resuspended in 1 ml PBS and finally plated ( 10 ml spots ) on nutrient agar and incubated overnight .
Assays of nitrite and nitrate accumulation in tissue culture supernatants .
Macrophage production of NO was measured by assaying NO 2 and NO 3 accumulation in culture supernatants as described in Stevanin et al. ( 2005 ) using a model 280i NO Analyser ( Sievers ) .
Quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) .
RNA was extracted from 1 ml of a mid - exponential - phase aerobic culture of wild - type and nsrR strains using Qiagen RNAprotect and RNeasy kits as described by the manufacturer .
Briefly , for each extraction , 1 ml culture was transferred into 2 ml RNAprotect reagent , followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min .
The samples were centrifuged at 6000 g for 10 min ; the supernatant was discarded , and pellets frozen at 280 uC until use .
The cell pellets were lysed after addition of 100 ml Tris - EDTA buffer containing lysozyme ( Sigma ) at a final concentration of 1 mg ml 21 .
RNA was purified as recommended by Qiagen and an on - column DNase digest was carried out using the RNase - free DNase set ( Qiagen ) .
RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an Eppendorf Biophotometer .
For cDNA synthesis , 4 mg RNA was added to 3 ml of a solution of random hexamer primers ( Amersham Biosciences , 3 mg ml 21 ) and annealing was achieved by incubation at 65 uC for 10 min , 22 uC for 10 min and 2 min on ice .
Reaction mixes ( 20 ml ) containing 0.5 mM dATP , dTTP , dGTP and dCTP were incubated for 1 h at 42 uC with 200 units of Superscript II RNase - H Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen Superscript II kit ) .
Following synthesis , cDNA was purified using a PCR purification kit ( Qiagen ) and eluted in 200 ml RNase - free water .
Gene - specific primers were designed to amplify 50 - to 150 - nucleotide fragments of target genes using PRIMER3 software ( Rozen & Skaletsky , 2000 ) .
Each reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25 ml on a 96 - well optical reaction plate ( Applied Biosystems ) .
Each well contained 0.5 ml 506 SYBR Green solution , 12.5 ml 26 Sensimix solution ( Quantace ) , 3.25 pmol of each of the two primers and 5 ml cDNA sample .
PCR amplification was carried out in an ABI 7700 thermocycler ( PE Applied Biosystems ) with the following thermal cycling conditions : 50 uC for 2 min ; 95 uC for 10 min ; 40 cycles of 95 uC for 15 s ; 60 uC for 1 min .
No - template reactions were included http://mic.sgmjournals.org 1759 N. J. Gilberthorpe and others as negative controls .
The data were analysed as described before ( Flatley et al. , 2005 ) .
Reverse transcriptase PCR ( RT - PCR ) .
cDNA was synthesized as described above ; 1 ml of this was used as the template in a standard PCR reaction mixture using Accuzyme Polymerase ( Bioline ) to amplify .
Determination of inhibition of respiration by NO .
The method was adapted from Stevanin et al. ( 2000 ) .
Cultures ( 25 ml ) were grown for 5.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 ml PBS .
The buffer was saturated with air in a Clark - type polarographic oxygen electrode system ( Rank Bros ) , comprising a water - jacketed ( 37 uC ) Perspex chamber stirred magnetically ; the membrane - covered electrode was situated at the bottom of the chamber below the stirrer .
Cell suspension ( 300 ml ) was added , a close - fitting lid applied to the chamber , and an ISO - NOP NO sensor ( 2 mm diameter ) ( WPI ) was inserted through a custom - made capillary hole in the lid .
Oxygen levels in the chamber were allowed to fall by 50 -- 60 % through respiration before 100 ml of anoxic , NOsaturated solution was injected into the chamber using a Hamilton microsyringe .
Oxygen consumption and NO levels were measured until the chamber contents became anaerobic .
Parametric data were analysed for significance using the t - test and data plotted at means with error bars representing standard deviations ( SD ) or standard errors ( SEM ) where stated .
Nonparametric data were analysed for significance using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and data plotted as medians with error bars representing the 25th and 75th percentiles .
Statistical significance was established at a P value of ,0.05 .
RESULTS A S. typhimurium nsrR mutant constitutively synthesizes Hmp , aerobically and anaerobically An nsrR mutant was created by the insertion of a Cm resistance cassette in S. typhimurium using the l - red recombination system ( Poteete & Fenton , 1984 ) .
The mutation was transduced into a wild - type background using phage P22 and confirmed by PCR amplification of the nsrR region .
Immediately downstream of nsrR is a gene encoding riboendonuclease R , rnr , formerly vacB .
coli , nsrR and rnr are co - transcribed ( Cairrao et al. , 2003 ) and Rnr has been implicated in expression of virulence genes in Shigella and enteroinvasive E. coli ( Tobe et al. , 1992 ) .
Since there is a possibility that this is also the case in Salmonella , a complementation test was conducted as follows .
pBR322 was engineered to carry the wild - type allele of nsrR ( pBR322nsrR + ) and the plasmid used to transform nsrR mutant by electroporation .
To verify that the nsrR phenotype described is due to mutation of nsrR and not due to polar effects on the rnr gene , PCR was carried out on rnr cDNA from both wild - type and nsrR strains .
The expression of rnr and of the gene encoding carbomoyl phosphatase , carA ( as control ) , were indistinguishable in the wild - type strain and nsrR mutant ( Fig. 1a ) .
Wild - type , nsrR and hmp strains were grown to midexponential phase , both aerobically and anaerobically , in LB - medium in the presence or absence of 1 mM GSNO .
Western blots were performed using rabbit anti - E .
coli - Hmp polyclonal antibodies as a probe ( Fig. 1b , c ) and clearly indicate the role of NsrR in the negative regulation of hmp in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .
An hmp mutant did not display a band corresponding to Hmp under any conditions .
In the wild - type strain , a band corresponding to Hmp was detected only after cells were exposed to GSNO , whereas in the nsrR mutant strain a strong band corresponding to Hmp was observed in both the presence and absence of GSNO , illustrating loss of negative regulation in the mutant .
Even in the presence of 1 mM GSNO , hmp was not maximally expressed in the wild - type strain , as demonstrated by comparison of the Hmp band intensity with that of the nsrR mutant .
Our findings are in agreement with Rodionov et al. ( 2005 ) , who used bioinformatics to predict that NsrR negatively regulates hmp and several other genes in a small regulon .
Recently Bang et al. ( 2006 ) also identified NsrR as a regulator of Hmp in S. typhimurium using qRT - PCR .
Western blots identical to those described above were also carried out on the nsrR strains carrying pBR322 and pBR322nsrR + ( Fig. 1c ) and show that Hmp is expressed as in the nsrR mutant in nsrR carrying pBR322 and as in the wild - type in nsrR carrying pBR322nsrR + ; this expression of nsrR + in trans restores its function as a repressor of hmp under non - nitrosating conditions .
The S. typhimurium NsrR regulon contains at least four other genes Rodionov et al. ( 2005 ) identified the following S. typhimurium genes as being potentially under the regulation of NsrR : the hcp - hcr ( nipAB ) operon , hmp , ytfE ( nipC ) and tehB .
In addition they suggested that E. coli ygbA is also regulated by NsrR .
We tested the influence of the nsrR mutation on the expression of these genes using qRT - PCR .
In addition , we looked at the expression of tehA , which is located just upstream of tehB , and with which it may be cotranscribed .
The upregulation of mRNA levels in the nsrR mutant strain in comparison to wild - type was as follows : ytfE , 544 ; hcp , 284 ; ygbA , 31.8 ; hcr , 4.1 ; tehA , 1.1 ; tehB , 1.1 .
Data presented here are representative of a single RT - PCR experiment using cDNA from wild - type and nsrR strains in technical triplicates .
A biological repeat of this was carried out giving a similar trend in gene expression levels .
carA was again used as the control gene .
The function of ytfE is unclear , although several global transcriptional analyses in E. coli have shown it to be highly induced under conditions of nitrosative - stress ( Mukhopadhyay et al. , 2004 ; Justino et al. , 2005 ; Pullan et al. , 2007 ) .
The ygbA gene also has no known function .
hcp and hcr are both upregulated in our nsrR mutant .
In E. coli , they are considered to be co - transcribed ( van den Berg et al. , 2000 ) , yet levels of hcr mRNA levels were only 4.1 - fold greater in the mutant strain .
This might be explained by differential stability of the mRNA transcript leading to faster degradation of the hcr portion of the transcript .

Cells were exposed where indicated ( + ) to 1 mM GSNO in LB for 2 h during exponential phase , prior to harvesting .
Cell - free extracts were resolved by SDS - PAGE and Western blots performed using antibody raised to E. coli purified Hmp .
Similar protein loadings ( 10 mg ) were used for each gel lane .
The hmp gene is the NsrR regulon member conferring GSNO resistance On finding that hmp is constitutively expressed in an nsrR mutant ( Fig. 1b ) , we tested resistance of the mutant to nitrosative - stress by growth in LB - medium in the presence or absence of 3 mM GSNO .
Fig. 2 ( a ) shows that the aerobic growth characteristics of nsrR and wild - type strains are indistinguishable .
In the presence of 3 mM GSNO , however , growth of the wild - type strain was more severely affected than that of the nsrR strain , presumably because enhanced expression of hmp in the nsrR strain affords more protection from GSNO .
However , to establish if other members of the NsrR regulon protect against GSNO , an nsrR hmp double mutant was created by P22 transduction of the hmp mutation into the nsrR mutant , and the construct verified by Western blot analysis ( not shown ) .
Growth curves in the absence or presence of 3 mM GSNO ( Fig. 2b ) show that removal of Hmp from the nsrR mutant abrogates the enhanced GSNO resistance of the nsrR mutant .
Fig. 2 ( c ) shows that a single hmp mutant has the same growth profile as the nsrR hmp double mutant in the presence of 3 mM GSNO .
Mutants in ytfE and hcp hcr were also tested for their sensitivity to GSNO and were found to display growth profiles similar to that of wild - type ( data not shown ) .
Thus , no other members of the NsrR regulon are directly involved in conferring the ability to grow in the presence of GSNO .
Overexpression of genes other than hmp can protect S. typhimurium respiration from inhibition by NO To test the effect of NO on respiration , mid - exponentialphase cells were allowed to respire aerobically in PBS until dissolved oxygen tension reached approximately 40 % of air saturation , at which point 100 ml NO - saturated solution was added to the cells .
Fig. 3 ( a ) shows that respiration of wild - type cells was totally but temporarily inhibited .
NO addition was visualized by a rapid upward excursion of the NO electrode output while oxygen uptake was abruptly http://mic.sgmjournals.org 1761 N. J.

arrested for less than 2 min .
After NO concentration fell , reaching negligible amounts approximately 1.5 min post - NO addition , oxygen uptake resumed at a rate similar to that before NO addition .
The slight upwards deflection in the oxygen electrode traces seen after inhibition of respiration ( and also in Fig. 3b and d ) presumably reflects polarographic drift or the back - diffusion of oxygen into the chamber through the capillary used for NO addition .
A trace similar to that of wild - type can be seen in Fig. 3 ( f ) , where the nsrR mutant is complemented by pBR322nsrR + .
A slightly prolonged inhibition of oxygen uptake can be seen in this trace , presumably attributed to multiple copies of the nsrR gene exerting higher repression on hmp than the single copy of nsrR in the wild - type genome .
In the hmp strain ( Fig. 3b ) , although NO addition was evident by a similar spike to that seen in the wild - type experiment , the Fig. 3 .
Hmp is the most significant member of the NsrR regulon conferring resistance of aerobic respiration to NO .

Data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments .
Note that the recovery of respiration after NO inhibition in ( a ) , ( d ) and ( f ) is spontaneous .
1762 Microbiology 153 The NsrR regulon of Salmonella disappearance of NO was slower , and even after 6 min a significant amount of NO could be measured by the NO electrode .
Oxygen uptake by the hmp mutant was severely affected by addition of NO and did not resume within 5 min of NO addition .
Thus Hmp protects S. typhimurium from the effects of NO on aerobic respiration .
Conversely , the nsrR mutant and the nsrR strain carrying pBR322 , synthesizing high levels of Hmp , were unaffected by NO ( Fig. 3c , e ) ; indeed , NO was consumed so quickly in each case that added NO was virtually undetectable by the electrode .
Furthermore , directly following NO addition , a transient increase in oxygen uptake occurred , attributable to the Hmp - catalysed oxygenase mechanism ( Gardner et al. , 1998 ) .
To assess the possible roles of other members of the NsrR regulon , the polarographic analyses were extended to the nsrR hmp mutant ( Fig. 3d ) .
In this strain , despite the lack of Hmp - catalysed NO removal , NO was consumed more rapidly than for the hmp mutant ( Fig. 3b ) and respiration resumed within 2 min of NO addition .
We conclude that other gene ( s ) in the nsrR regulon , expressed to high levels in the nsrR hmp mutant , exert protective effects on respiration in the presence of NO .
To try to establish which NsrR - regulated genes were responsible for protection in the nsrR hmp double mutants , mutants in ytfE and hcp hcr along with mutants in nsrR ytfE and nsrR hcp hcr were all tested for their ability to withstand NO inhibition of respiration .
The ytfE and hcp hcr mutants showed profiles similar to that of wild - type ( data not shown ) , and nsrR ytfE and nsrR hcp hcr mutants showed profiles similar to that of the nsrR mutant ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that ytfE and hcp hcr do not have a role in protection of respiration from NO , when a functional hmp gene is still present .
Several attempts were made throughout this study to construct an ygbA mutant to investigate its role in the above but were unsuccessful .
nsrR , hmp and fur mutations attenuate survival in J774 .2 macrophages In this study we used the mouse macrophage cell line J774 .2 .
Prior to investigation of intracellular survival , each Salmonella strain was examined for the extent of association ( defined here as the total number of bacteria either bound or internalized per macrophage ) , binding and internalization with J774 .2 , via fluorescence microscopy .
After 30 min incubation , all bacterial strains associated similarly with the macrophages ( data not shown ) so that subsequent viable counts reflect intracellular survival and not differences in internalization .
We also carried out gentamicin sensitivity tests to demonstrate that all strains were affected equally by the antibiotic used to kill extracellular bacteria following 30 min infection : all strains were equally sensitive to gentamicin ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , the effects of bacterial infection on survival of J774 .2 cells over 21 h were also examined ; a trypan blue assay revealed insignificant effects on cytotoxicity ( data not shown ) .
Following infection ( mean m.o.i. of 11.25 ) , macrophages were lysed after 0.5 , 4 , 15 and 21 h and viable counts were carried out on the lysates to enumerate surviving intracellular bacteria .
Fig. 4 ( a ) shows that , in the absence of prior IFN - c stimulation , there was no significant difference in the intracellular survival of wild - type and hmp mutant strains .
However , mutation in the global iron response regulator , Fur , significantly affected the intracellular survival and proliferation of bacteria ; resulting in significantly lower bacterial numbers being recovered , even after the initial 0.5 h infection period , indicating that the fur strain is unable to survive even the initial exposure to the intracellular macrophage environment .
After 4 h infection , the number of recovered wild - type cells was over threefold higher than fur cells , and after 15 and 21 h wild - type counts were over double that of fur mutant counts ( Fig. 4a ) .
These data suggest that the null fur mutant is severely attenuated in naïve macrophages , but that mutation in the NO - detoxifying globin gene , hmp , does not significantly affect the ability of S. typhimurium to survive under the same conditions .
The data also suggest that fur is attenuated in these macrophages by an antimicrobial mechanism other than the nitrosative burst .
In subsequent experiments , macrophages were incubated with IFN - c ( 1000 U ml 21 ) for approximately 9 h prior to infection .
IFN - c enhances a nitrosative - stress response in macrophages upon infection with S. typhimurium ( Kalupahana et al. , 2005 ) .
As expected ( Liu et al. , 1999 ) , the numbers of bacteria recovered from activated J774 .2 cells were lower than those recovered from non - stimulated J774 .2 cells for all three strains ( Fig. 4b ) , with wild - type numbers increasing only fivefold between 4 h and 21 h infection as compared to a 16 - fold increase in nonactivated cells ( Fig. 4a ) .
The enhanced nitrosative - stress associated with activation severely impairs survival and proliferation of the hmp mutant .
The greatest differences between wild - type and both hmp and fur cell counts were seen at 15 and 21 h after infection , with numbers of wildtype reaching approximately two - and fourfold that of the mutant strains , respectively .
These results clearly indicate the requirement for Hmp and Fur in maximal survival and proliferation in activated macrophages .
Since the nsrR mutant is hyper - resistant to GSNO ( Fig. 2a ) and NO ( Fig. 3c ) , we hypothesized that this mutant may display additional resistance to killing by macrophages .
Kim et al. ( 2003 ) reported that , when hcp , hcr and ytfE ( nipABC ) Salmonella mutants were used to infect mice , the ability of animals to clear the infection with these strains was diminished at low doses .
We compared the survival of both the nsrR and nsrR hmp mutants to wild - type bacteria in IFN - c-stimulated macrophages ( Fig. 4c ) using a slightly lower m.o.i. of 7.5 to aid bacterial counting .
Comparison of the wild - type strain in Fig. 4 ( b , c ) indicates that a larger m.o.i. is required for proliferation of S. typhimurium in activated J774 .2 cells over a 21 h period and that a decrease in m.o.i. ( in this case of ~ 33 % ) , does not correspond to an equal fall in c.f.u. ml 21 of wild - type Salmonella at 0.5 h ( in this case it fell to ~ 53 % ) , suggesting that J774 .2 cells are more effective at limiting survival of Salmonella immediately http://mic.sgmjournals.org 1763 N. J. Gilberthorpe and others Fig. 4 .
Intracellular survival of Salmonella is compromised in a fur mutant , but only in the presence of c - IFN in an hmp mutant .
Bacterial cells ( ~ 2.5 3/4 10 6 ) suspended in 250 ml DMEM +10 % FCS were used to infect ~ 2 3/4 10 5 J774 .2 cells ( a ) and J774 .2 cells stimulated with IFN - c ( b ) , giving an m.o.i. of ~ 11 .
Bacterial cells ( ~ 1.5 3/4 10 6 ) similarly suspended were used to infect ~ 2 3/4 10 5 J774 .2 cells ( c ) , giving an m.o.i. of ~ 7.5 .
The intracellular survival and proliferation was followed over time .
At 0.5 h , cell counts include extracellular bacteria together with viable internalized bacteria .
At subsequent time points , extracellular bacteria have been killed using gentamicin , leaving only viable intracellular bacteria .
At each time point , counts for wild - type and for hmp and fur mutant strains are shown by the black , white and hatched bars , respectively in ( a ) and ( b ) .

after infection , and reducing subsequent proliferation , when the initial infection load is smaller .
Our primary concern in this study was not to discern the correlation between infecting m.o.i. and survival of wild - type Salmonella but rather to assess whether there is a difference in the survival of wild - type and mutant strains of Salmonella .
Surprisingly , we observed that both the nsrR and nsrR hmp mutants survived similarly intracellularly ( Fig. 4c ) , with bacterial counts for both strains being twofold lower than wild - type at 15 and 21 h lysis time points .
A possible explanation of these data is that Hmp at high levels exerts toxic effects by the production of O -LCB- : 2 ( Membrillo - Hernandez et al. , 1996 ; Wu et al. , 2004 ) , so that the nsrR mutant , having elevated Hmp levels , is disadvantaged in macrophages due to exacerbated sensitivity to the oxidative response produced by the macrophages .
To clarify that the nsrR mutation was not having polar effects on the downstream gene , rnr , which could have a role in virulence ( Tobe et al. , 1992 ) , intracellular survival of the nsrR mutant carrying pBR322nsrR + was assessed in activated macrophages .
Fig. 4 ( d ) shows that inclusion of wild - type nsrR on a plasmid caused the intracellular survival of the nsrR mutant to return to the same level as the wild - type strain at 21 h. Nitrite and nitrate accumulation in tissue culture supernatants We sought to verify the elevated production of NO in IFNc - stimulated J774 .2 cells by assaying NO 2 levels in tissue culture , as NO produced by iNOS is expected to be oxidized to NO 2 in the presence of oxygen ( Ignarro et al. , 1993 ; Wink et al. , 1993 ; Kharitonov et al. , 1994 ) .
In the presence of Hmp , NO is detoxified to NO 3 ( Gardner et al. , 1998 ; Hausladen et al. , 1998 ) .
Supernatant fractions from non - stimulated macrophages accumulated very little NO 2 1764 Microbiology 153 The NsrR regulon of Salmonella compared to their activated counterparts ( Fig. 5a ii ) .
In non - activated , uninfected cells , NO 2 levels were ~ 0.3 mM throughout the study , whereas in stimulated macrophages , NO 2 increased consistently throughout the experiment to ~ 4 mM after 21 h , confirming activation of iNOS .
NO 2 levels detected in non - activated J774 .2 cells in the presence of wild - type ( Fig. 5a i ) and fur ( Fig. 5a iii ) strains were similar , with accumulations of around 3 mM after 21 h of infection whereas levels of NO 2 were slightly higher in hmp - infected J774 .2 cells ( 5.5 mM ) ( Fig. 5a ii ) .
This could reflect the accumulation of NO in hmp infected cells and its oxidation to NO 2 , whereas in wild - type and fur strains , Hmp converts NO to NO 3 .
We tested this hypothesis by measuring the accumulation of NO 3 in tissue culture media over time .
As with NO 2 , steady increases in NO 3 concentration were detected over the time - course of infection with all strains .
Fig. 5 ( c ) shows the total NO 3 accumulated at 21 h. NO 3 levels reached a mean of 8.7 mM in the supernatants of non - activated , uninfected cells after 21 h. NO 3 accumulation in wild - type - infected cells had a mean of 21.3 mM ( Fig. 5c ) .
Both hmp - and fur - infected J774 .2 tissue culture supernatants showed a similar accumulation of NO 3 , which was significantly lower than that of wild - type bacteria at around 15 mM .
However , IFNc - activated J774 .2 cells infected with Salmonella produced large amounts of NO 3 over 21 h ( ~ 40 mM for the wildtype strain ) , compared to the non - stimulated , infected J774 .2 cells .
The NO 3 concentration in supernatants from stimulated macrophages was somewhat lower , at around 23 mM , for hmp - and fur - infected J774 .2 cells ( Fig. 5c ) .
The lower level of NO 3 in the supernatant of hmp - infected cells could reflect an inability of the hmp mutant to detoxify NO to NO 3 ; however , as the fur infected cells showed similar NO 3 accumulation , it is probably more likely that differences in NO 3 accumulation seen in both nonactivated and activated tissue culture supernatants could be Fig. 5 .

http://mic.sgmjournals.org 1765 N. J. Gilberthorpe and others explained by the fact that iNOS activation may be infection - load dependent ( Witthoft et al. , 1998 ) .
Tissue culture supernatants were also collected from experiments where wild - type , nsrR and nsrR hmp strains were used to infect IFN - c-stimulated macrophages and used to assay NO 2 and NO 3 accumulations ( Fig. 5b and d , respectively ) .
Although nsrR mutant bacteria have elevated levels of Hmp relative to wild - type , no significant differences in NO 2 or NO 3 levels were detected , perhaps as a result of the loss of bacterial viability ( see Fig. 4c ) and therefore lower activity levels of iNOS ( Witthoft et al. , 1998 ) .
Macrophages infected with the nsrR hmp double mutant also showed no significant difference from the wild - type in NO 2 and NO 3 accumulation ( Fig. 5b , d ) , perhaps due to the lack of significant NO - metabolizing activity by the strain and the poor viability of such bacteria ( Fig. 4c ) .
An nsrR mutation enhances sensitivity to oxidative - stress , even in the absence of Hmp We hypothesized that the compromised survival of nsrR mutant bacteria in macrophages is due to intracellular oxidative - stress resulting from excessive Hmp synthesis and its reduction of O 2 to O -LCB- : 2 ( Membrillo - Hernandez et al. , 1996 ; Wu et al. , 2004 ) .
This was tested in - vitro using two different oxidative - stress agents to study the response of wild - type , nsrR , hmp and nsrR hmp strains .
Paraquat produces O -LCB- : 2 and is toxic to bacteria in - vitro ( Liochev & Fridovich , 1993 ; Halliwell & Gutteridge , 1999 ) .
In the absence of paraquat , all three strains grew to similar final densities although growth of the nsrR mutant , but not the double mutant , was significantly slower during most of the growth curve ( Fig. 6a ) .
This is consistent with an inhibitory effect of excess Hmp synthesis in the absence of NO .
Growth of the nsrR mutant in the presence of 200 mM paraquat showed some deficiency when compared to wildtype ( data not shown ) .
However , in the presence of 500 mM paraquat , growth of the nsrR mutant was almost completely inhibited ( Fig. 6a ) , whereas the nsrR hmp strain ( Fig. 6a ) had growth characteristics similar to the wildtype , as did the hmp mutant ( Fig. 6b ) .
These results demonstrate that Hmp , but not other products of the NsrR regulon , exacerbate paraquat sensitivity .
The data also suggest that the poor survival of the nsrR hmp mutant in macrophages ( Fig. 4c ) is due not to oxidative - stress , but to the inability of the mutant to deal with nitrosative - stress , as in the hmp mutant .
O -LCB- : 2 spontaneously dismutates in solution to give peroxide ( Halliwell & Gutteridge , 1999 ; Imlay , 2002 ) .
We therefore also performed sensitivity tests to H 2 O 2 .
Strains were grown for 3 h before addition of 5 mM H 2 O 2 .
Culture samples were taken immediately prior to the addition and then at 10 and 25 min following the addition .
Viable counts were compared to the counts immediately prior to the stress ( Fig. 7 ) .
Approximately 50 % of wild - type cells survived following 10 and 25 min exposure to H 2 O 2 ( Fig. 7a ) .
The hmp strain gave a profile almost identical to that of the wild - type ( Fig. 7a inset ) .
The most severely affected strain was the nsrR mutant , with less than 10 % of cells surviving at 10 and 25 min after H 2 O 2 treatment ( Fig. 7a ) .
To confirm that the H 2 O 2 sensitivity was a trait of the nsrR mutation and therefore overexpression of hmp , nsrR mutants carrying pBR322nsrR + or pBR322 were also tested ( Fig. 7b ) .
The nsrR mutant carrying pBR322 gave a killing profile identical to the nsrR mutation whereas the nsrR mutant carrying pBR322nsrR + behaved like the wild - type .
However , the nsrR hmp mutant also exhibited exacerbated H 2 O 2 sensitivity , compared to wild - type , particularly after 25 min ( Fig. 7a ) .

although it seems possible that overexpression of a member of the NsrR regulon , other than Hmp , contributes to sensitivity to H 2 O 2 .
Interestingly , recent studies in E. coli have shown that mutants in hcp are more sensitive to H 2 O 2 ( Almeida et al. , 2006 ) , implicating Hcp in the oxidative stress response ; thus overexpression of hcp is unlikely to increase oxidative - stress sensitivity of the nsrR hmp mutant .
The Salmonella hcp hcr and ytfE mutants were not increased in their sensitivity to H 2 O 2 in these experiments ( Fig. 7c , d ) , indicating possible differences in the properties of Hcp in E. coli and Salmonella .
DISCUSSION This study has confirmed that NsrR is a major regulator of hmp in S. typhimurium both aerobically and anaerobically ( Fig. 1b , c ) , and mutation in nsrR protects against the effects of GSNO in - vitro .
This protection is shown to be a direct consequence of overexpression of hmp , as removal of hmp in an nsrR mutant abrogates the extra protection and leads to a growth pattern , in the presence of GSNO , that is similar to that of a single hmp mutant ( Fig. 2 ) .
The absence of NsrR , with consequent overexpression of Hmp , also protects respiration from inhibition by NO ( Fig. 3 ) .
However , in contrast to the growth effects , we show that this is due , not only to overexpression of hmp , but also to the overexpression of other gene ( s ) since , in the nsrR hmp double mutant , respiration recovers in a manner similar to the wild - type strain .
In an hmp single mutant , respiration does not recover over the time period of the experiment , presumably due to the failure of Hmp to detoxify NO .
Thus , no other members of the NsrR regulon can protect growth from the adverse effects of nitrosative - stress ( GSNO ) but one or more of the other members of the NsrR regulon ( hcp , hcr , ytfE , ygbA or other unidentified gene ) are involved in protection of the oxidative electrontransport chain from inhibition by NO , at least in the absence of functional hmp .
tehA and tehB expression in the S. typhimurium nsrR mutant was not increased , whereas in E. coli tehA was shown to be weakly regulated by nsrR ( Bodenmiller & Spiro , 2006 ) .
The tehA and tehB gene products are involved in resistance to tellurite and other http://mic.sgmjournals.org 1767 N. J. Gilberthorpe and others toxic compounds ( Turner et al. , 1997 ) but roles for these genes in nitrosative - stress resistance are unknown .
It has been suggested that ytfE may have a role in [ Fe -- S ] cluster biogenesis in E. coli ( Justino et al. , 2006 ) .
In S. typhimurium , ytfE has been identified as having a promoter that is maximally induced by NO 2 in a pH - dependent manner ( Kim et al. , 2003 ) .
Mutants in ytfE are less readily cleared by mice in low - dose infection , the mechanism of which remains unknown ( Kim et al. , 2003 ) .
Hcp contains two [ Fe -- S ] clusters of unusual redox properties , and Hcr has sequence similarity to flavin - containing and [ Fe -- S ] - containing class 1 NADH oxidoreductases and has been shown to reduce Hcp in the presence of NADH ( van den Berg et al. , 2000 ) .
Like ytfE , the hcp hcr genes have also been shown to be optimally expressed in 1 mM NO 2 at pH 5 , induced in NO - producing macrophages and less readily cleared by mice in low - dose infection ( Kim et al. , 2003 ) .
Recently , the E. coli Hcp has been implicated in the oxidative - stress response ( Almeida et al. , 2006 ) .
The ygbA gene has no known function , although it has been shown to be regulated by nsrR in E. coli ( Bodenmiller & Spiro , 2006 ) .
Despite an nsrR mutant being hyper - resistant to GSNO and NO in - vitro ( Figs 2 and 3 ) , we show that tight regulation of hmp expression is of paramount importance for survival in murine macrophages ( Fig. 4 ) , where bacteria will experience a range of stresses .
Preliminary experiments assessing the survival of hmp and fur mutants in naïve macrophages suggested that the nitrosative - stress response in these macrophages is not strong enough to attenuate survival of the hmp mutant ( Fig. 4a ) but other stresses , particularly levels of radical and oxidizing species , have deleterious effects on the intracellular survival of a mutant in the global regulator , Fur ( Fig. 4a ) .
Previous work looking at the intracellular survival of a Salmonella SL1344 fur mutant in macrophages demonstrated that this strain was not severely attenuated in intracellular survival ( Garcia - del Portillo et al. , 1993 ) .
Later experiments by Wilmes - Riesenberg et al. ( 1996 ) also showed that the SL1344 fur mutant was not attenuated in its survival within J774 .2 macrophages but that the degree to which a fur mutation affects virulence depends on the background strain of Salmonella , with the SL1344 fur mutant showing only a small increase in LD 50 in mouse infection .
These results could indicate why the 14028s fur strain used in this study shows an attenuation in J774 .2 cells not seen before .
IFN - c was used to enhance the antimicrobial nitrosative response .
IFN - c is the major macrophage - activating cytokine ( Unanue , 1993 ) .
The resulting activation of iNOS is illustrated by the reduced survival of the hmp mutant ( Fig. 4b ) , which was significantly lower than wildtype in activated cells .
The fall in hmp bacterial counts demonstrates the impaired ability of this strain to withstand nitrosative - stress due to lack of the NOdetoxifying globin .
NO 2 and NO 3 accumulation in tissue culture supernatants of infected cells confirms the enhanced activity of iNOS in the presence of IFN - c ( Fig. 5 ) .
Salmonella are known to interfere with the localization of iNOS ( Chakravortty et al. , 2002 ) , which may be enough to defend against RNS damage in the non - stimulated J774 .2 but , in activated cells , where greater amounts of RNS are produced , Hmp appears to be required .
This is in agreement with Bang et al. ( 2006 ) , who showed a role for Hmp in acute and chronic mouse infection models and also presented data showing that a hmp mutant is not attenuated in infection of mice fed with the iNOS inhibitor L - NIL .
Generally , RNS production by macrophages is thought to cause bacterial cell death via ( in ) activation of enzymes , ion channels and transcription factors , and mutation of DNA by strand breakage ( Szabo et al. , 1996 ) .
However , a mechanism involving the IFN - c-stimulated production of NO causing an inhibition of Salmonella SPI - 2 effector expression has been reported , triggering the Salmonella - containing vacuole to interact more efficiently with compartments of the lysosomal/endosomal system , resulting in increased effectiveness of Salmonella killing by macrophages ( McCollister et al. , 2005 ) .
With enhanced expression of hmp and other genes in the NsrR regulon , it was predicted that the nsrR mutant might have an advantage over wild - type S. typhimurium in survival within IFN - c-activated macrophages .
However , our results suggest quite the opposite , both the nsrR and the nsrR hmp mutants being attenuated in IFN - c-activated macrophages ( Fig. 4c ) .
Furthermore , in - vitro work demonstrated that the nsrR mutant is hyper - sensitive to both paraquat ( Fig. 6a ) and H 2 O 2 and that the nsrR hmp mutant is sensitive to H 2 O 2 ( Fig. 7 ) .
We have previously demonstrated that the presence of haem and FAD in Hmp not only provides a facile electron transfer from NAD ( P ) H to O 2 and NO in the active site where NO 3 formation occurs , but also renders the protein susceptible to participation in additional redox chemistry .
Specifically , reduction of oxygen to O -LCB- : 2 was first proposed by Orii et al. ( 1992 ) , then demonstrated experimentally ( Membrillo - Hernandez et al. , 1996 ; Wu et al. , 2004 ) .
Hmp acts as a reductase of broad specificity , reducing oxygen , cytochrome c and Fe ( III ) - hydroxamate K , apparently without the involvement of the haem , since cytochrome c reduction can be demonstrated in the presence of CO ( Poole et al. , 1997 ) .
Recent work in S. typhimurium ( Bang et al. , 2006 ) has confirmed that the FAD - binding domain of Hmp mediates hyper - susceptibility to oxidative - stress .
Although these authors suggest specifically the reduction of Fe ( III ) to Fe ( II ) as demonstrated before ( Poole et al. , 1997 ) , and subsequent Fenton reaction chemistry ( Woodmansee & Imlay , 2003 ) , the reductive abilities of Hmp might facilitate numerous other reactions .
Fig. 8 illustrates the network of interactions centring on Hmp .
A large corpus of biochemical and physiological data supports the concept that Hmp possesses critical O 2 - dependent NO - detoxifying activity yet also has the potential for generating ROS in the absence of NO .
A multitude of layers of transcriptional regulation provide the fine - tuning of Hmp levels necessary .
1768 Microbiology 153 The NsrR regulon of Salmonella Fig. 8 .
Contributions of NsrR , Hmp and Fur to NO tolerance and intracellular survival in Salmonella .
Entities ( genes , proteins , regulatory events , metabolic products ) that increase on nitrosative - stress are shown in red .
Positive ( + ) and negative ( '' ) gene regulation patterns refer to the effects of regulators in the absence of NO .
Superoxide production from Hmp , which decreases with NO , is shown in blue .
Transcription of hmp is positively regulated by MetR ( in response to NO + - mediated homocysteine deprivation ) and RamA ( on exposure to superoxide ) , but negatively regulated by Fnr , Fur ( weakly ) and NsrR ( strongly ) .
Hmp catalyses the aerobic conversion of NO to nitrate , but ( predominantly at the flavin domain ) also reduces oxygen to superoxide in the absence of NO .
In the presence of NO , repression by NsrR of hcp , hcr , ytfE and ygbA is lifted , and repression by Fur of at least 30 ( Ratledge & Dover , 2000 ) genes is also lifted .
At the right are shown the roles revealed in the present work of Hmp and the NsrR and Fur regulon components .
Furthermore , additional modes of protection from nitrosative stress are clearly indicated by the current results from the nsrR hmp construct .
Further work is required to assess the role of other NsrR regulon members .
It is notable that , within the intracellular environment , the nsrR strain appears unable to withstand the oxidative - stress emanating from both macrophage and Hmp , despite the possession by S. typhimurium of several antioxidant enzymes including four SODs , namely two periplasmic Cu , Zn - SODs ( SodC I and SodC II ) ( Fang et al. , 1999 ) , a Mn - SOD ( SodA ) ( Tsolis et al. , 1995 ) and an Fe - SOD ( SodB ) .
SODs dismutate O -LCB- : 2 to H 2 O 2 , which can then be disproportionated into H 2 O and O 2 by catalases .
S. typhimurium also possesses two catalases , encoded by katG and katE .
KatG and KatE are often referred to as HPI and HPII , respectively ( for a review see Storz & Imlay , 1999 ) .
The results presented here suggest that these mechanisms of protection are overwhelmed by excess O -LCB- : 2 production in the nsrR mutant when Hmp is overexpressed .
In vitro , the nsrR hmp double mutant is not affected by paraquat at the concentration used here but is affected by H 2 O 2 , although to a lesser degree than an nsrR mutation alone .
This suggests that overexpression of a member ( s ) of the NsrR regulon other than hmp also enhances sensitivity to H 2 O 2 .
