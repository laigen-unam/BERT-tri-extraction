176 , No. 12 Stoichiometry of Binding of CysB to the cysJIH , cysK , and cysP Promoter Regions of Salmonella typhimurium MONIKA M. HRYNIEWICZt AND NICHOLAS M. KREDICH * Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry , Duke University Medical Center , Durham , North Carolina 27710 CysB is a member of the LysR family of transcriptional activators and regulates genes of the cysteine regulon in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli .
CysB binds to specific sites just upstream of the -35 regions of the cysJIH , cysK , and cysP promoters , where , in the presence of N - acetyl - L-serine , it stimulates transcription initiation .
The cysK and cysP promoters contain additional binding sites , and we have proposed that CysB bends these promoters by binding to adjacent sites .
N - Acetyl - L-serine is thought to decrease the magnitude of such bending .
Since stoichiometric data bearing on this model have been lacking , we analyzed complexes in gel mobility - shift experiments with 35S - labeled CysB and 32P - labeled promoter fragments .
CysB was found to bind as a tetramer , and N - acetyl - L-serine increased the electrophoretic mobilities of one - protein complexes of the multibinding site cysK and cysP promoters without changing their stoichiometry , indicating that a single CysB tetramer can bend these promoters and that N - acetyl - L-serine diminishes such bending .
Bend angles for both promoters were calculated to be 100 and 50 ° in the absence and presence of N - acetyl - L-serine .
N - Acetyl - L-serine affected neither the stoichiometry nor the electrophoretic mobility of cysJIH promoter complexes , which are not known to contain bent DNA .
DNA bending may be a mechanism for sequestering CysB at certain promoter sites by increasing their affinity for this protein in the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine .
CysB is a homotetrameric transcriptional activator ( 37 , 42 ) that positively regulates genes of the cysteine regulon in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli ( reviewed in references 31 and 32 ) .
CysB belongs to the LysR family , a large group of one - component prokaryotic transcriptional activators which bind to promoter -35 regions , presumably through a predicted helix - turn - helix DNA - binding motif ( 23 , 52 ) .
Binding sites for a number of LysR type proteins have been identified by their footprints , which are typically rather large , i.e. , 36 to 55 bp ( 11 , 33 , 53 , 56 , 61 ) .
In some instances , large footprints together with either ambiguously oriented repeat sequences ( 12 , 20 , 45 , 62 ) , lack of a strong consensus sequence ( 57 ) , or cooperative binding to contiguous sites ( 8 , 16 ) have hindered efforts to characterize relationships between proteinbinding units , i.e. , polypeptides , and DNA target domains .
This problem has been aggravated by the lack of binding stoichiometry for these interactions .
The question of binding stoichiometry has been particularly problematic in our studies of CysB , which also gives large footprints , recognizes multiple binding sites with limited similarities , and in some cases is thought to bend promoter DNA ( 24 , 39 , 45 ) .
In vitro binding to the positively regulated S. typhimurium cysJIH , cysK , and cysP promoters has been demonstrated at 40 - bp sites designated , respectively , CBS - J , CBS - Kl , and CBS - P1 ( Fig. 1 ) , which are located just upstream of their -35 regions ( 24 , 39 ) .
A deletion analysis has shown that CBS - K1 is required for CysB - dependent transcription initiation at the cysK promoter ( 39 ) , and CBS - J and CBS - P1 are thought to serve the same role in their promoters because of similarities in sequence and relative position .

3673 presence of the inducer N - acetyl - L-serine , which also stimulates binding to CBS - J , CBS - K1 , and CBS - P1 .
Increased binding affinity , however , can not be responsible per se for transcription initiation , because full occupancy of these sites in the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine does not activate transcription ( 24 , 39 , 43 , 44 ) .
The cysK promoter contains a second CysB - binding site , CBS - K2 , which is upstream of and contiguous with CBS - K1 ( 39 ) , and the cysP promoter contains two additional sites ( Fig. 1 ) : CBS - P2 , which is downstream of CBS - P1 and separated from it by about 21 bp ; and CBS - P3 , which lies between and overlaps portions of CBS - P1 and CBS - P2 ( 24 ) .
These extra sites are believed to be responsible for the fact that N - acetyl - L - serine increases the electrophoretic mobility of complexes between CysB and the cysK and cysP promoters but has no such effect with the cysJIH promoter or with the individual sites CBS - K1 , CBS - K2 , CBS - P1 , or CBS - P2 ( 24 , 39 , 44 ) .
We have proposed that this phenomenon is caused by the ability of CysB to bind to adjacent sites in the cysK and cysP promoters and bend DNA , which is known to cause anomalously slow electrophoretic mobility ( 63 ) .
N - Acetyl - L-serine is thought to prevent or lessen DNA bending and increase complex mobility by its ability to stimulate binding to CBS - K1 and CBS - P1 and inhibit binding to CBS - K2 and CBS - P3 ( 24 , 39 ) .
In view of the important role attributed to DNA bending in promoter activation ( 46 , 59 ) , we thought it important to document the existence and extent of CysB - induced bending in the cysK and cysP promoters , particularly since similar behavior has been reported for two other LysR family proteins , OccR ( 61 ) and NodD ( 12 ) .
If bending does occur , measurements of binding stoichiometry are essential for determining how many CysB tetramers are involved in this process .
A single CysB tetramer should have the capacity to bind to more than one site , particularly if the DNA is bent or looped in the process .
On the other hand , adjacent binding sites encompass large expanses of DNA ( as much as 77 bp ) , and bending or looping could be the result of interactions between two or 3674 HRYNIEWICZ AND KREDICH Transcription start site -115 - 35 1 +36 + !

Binding sites for CysB in the S. typhimurium cysJIH , cysK , and cysP promoters .
The same sites are presumed to exist in E. coli , which has promoter sequences that are almost identical to those of S. typhimurium ( 32 ) .
Transcription initiation is thought to require CBS - J , CBS - K1 , and CBS - P1 , which are located immediately upstream of promoter -35 regions ; other sites are of unknown function .
N - Acetyl - L - serine stimulates binding to the four shaded sites and inhibits binding to the other two .
more tetramers binding at different sites .
A third possibility is that CysB does not bend DNA at all and that changes in electrophoretic mobility simply reflect binding by different amounts of protein , e.g. , a slowly migrating two - protein complex in the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine and a more rapidly migrating one - protein complex in its presence .
Determinations of binding stoichiometry are not only important to the question whether CysB bends or loops DNA but also essential for a detailed understanding of interactions between CysB and cys promoters .
For instance , binding sites are currently defined only on the basis of their DNase I footprints , but stoichiometric measurements would allow us to determine whether they are composed of smaller domains , each with the capacity to recognize a separate 36 - kDa subunit of the CysB tetramer .
Furthermore , if what we now define as a single binding site were found to bind more than one CysB tetramer , greater attention would have to be directed at the possible role of intermolecular CysB interactions in the regulation of promoter activity .
In this communication we report data indicating that the simplest complexes of CysB with the cysJIH , cysK and cysP promoters contain a single protein tetramer .
Furthermore , one tetramer is sufficient to bend the cysK and cysP promoters , and N - acetyl - L-serine diminishes bending without changing complex stoichiometries .
The significance of these findings to regulation by CysB is discussed .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials .
S - Adenosylmethionine was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. and purified by high - performance liquid chromatography as described previously ( 30 ) .
No attempt was made to separate the ( - ) and ( + ) isomers .
The purified product was standardized spectrophotometrically , assuming an # 260 of 14.6 x 10 - 3 M - 1 cm - ' at pH 2 ( 3 ) .
S - Adenosylmethionine synthetase was partially purified from an E. coli metJ strain by the phenyl - Sepharose step of Markham et al. ( 35 ) and had a specific activity of 0.1 U/mg of protein , where 1 U of enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of 1 , mol of S - adenosylmethionine per min .
O - Acetyl - L-serine was synthesized as described previously ( 51 ) and was used as the free base .
Preparation of radiolabeled CysB .
pMHK14 was created by inserting a 1,357 - bp PstI - SacI fragment containing the S. typhimurium LT2 cysB coding region without its promoter ( 38 , 42 ) into the multicloning site of pUC19 .
The orientation of the insert in pMHK14 was such that cysB could be expressed from J. BACTERIOL .
the lac promoter of the parent vector and was preceded by a termination codon for the lacZ ' open reading frame .
E. coli NM522 [ supE thi - 1 Ahsd5 lA ( lac - proAB ) ( F ' proAB lacIqZAM15 ) ] containing pMHK14 was grown with shaking at 37 °C in a minimal salts medium ( 60 ) supplemented with 0.5 % glucose , 2 , ug of thiamine per ml , and 50 , ug of ampicillin per ml .
MgSO4 was replaced by an equimolar amount of MgCl2 , and sulfur was provided as 97 , uM Na235SO4 with a specific activity of approximately 27 mCi/mmol .
At a density of 2 x 108 cells per ml , 1 mM isopropyl - 3-D - thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce cysB expression .
After an additional 4 h , cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored as a pellet at -70 °C overnight .
CysB was purified as described previously ( 37 ) .
Approximately 0.5 mg of protein was obtained from 2 liters of cell culture .
Small portions were stored at -70 °C at a concentration of 0.13 mg of protein per ml in 50 mM Tris hydrochloride ( pH 8.0 ) - i mM disodium EDTA containing approximately 0.3 M ammonium sulfate .
For the determination of specific radioactivity , a 1 - mg portion of partially purified protein from the ammonium sulfate precipitation step was dialyzed against 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate , lyophilized to dryness , and hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 6 N HCl in a sealed evacuated tube for 16 h at 1 10 °C .
The lyophilized hydrolysate was dissolved in a small amount of water and used as a methionine substrate for the synthesis of S - [ 35S ] adenosylmethionine .
This reaction mixture contained 0.1 M Tris - HCl ( pH 8.5 ) , 0.2 M KCl , 20 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM ATP , 2 mM dithiothreitol , l0 - 4 U of partially purified E. coli S - adenosylmethionine synthetase , and protein hydrolysate containing approximately 2 nmol of [ 35S ] methionine in a final volume of 0.1 ml .
Following incubation at 37 °C for 90 min , the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of ice - cold 1 N perchloric acid , and precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation .
The supernatant was neutralized and analyzed by high - performance liquid chromatography as described previously ( 19 ) .
The specific radioactivity of S - adenosylmethionine was determined by its radiolabel content and A254 compared with those of a highly purified standard ( see above ) .
Since the sulfur moiety of methionine is derived from cysteine in E. coli , the two amino - acids were presumed to have the same specific radioactivity .
From the value obtained for methionine and from an amino - acid content of seven methionines and one cysteine per CysB monomer ( 37 , 42 ) , we calculated a specific radioactivity for CysB of 60 dpm/pmol of S or 480 dpm/pmol of 36 - kDa monomer , extrapolated back to the day of its synthesis .
At this relatively low specific radioactivity , no appreciable loss of total CysB should have occurred through the decay of sulfur atoms per se , because only 1 in approximately 1,700 CysB tetramers contained one or more 3 S atoms .
Over the 2 - month period encompassed by these studies , protein stains and autoradiographs of samples analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS - PAGE ) were virtually identical , except for the expected loss of radiolabel , and the binding activity of our preparation remained almost constant .
Radiolabeled DNA fragments for measurements of stoichiometry .
DNA fragments were synthesized by PCR with specific oligodeoxynucleotide primers , one of which was 5 ' - end labeled with 32p .
Radiolabeled primers were separated from [ 32P ] ATP by chromatography on Sephadex G - 25 , precipitated with ethanol , and dissolved in a small volume of 10 mM Tris hydrochloride ( pH 8.0 ) .
Chemical concentrations of purified radiolabeled primers were estimated spectrophotometrically with extinction coefficients that were calculated by adding the # 260 values of component nucleotides ( 15.4 x 103 , 11.5 X 103 , 7.4 x 103 , and 8.7 x 103 M - 1 cm - ' for A , G , C , and T , respectively ) .
176 , 1994 The radiolabel was measured under the same conditions used to estimate 35S and 32P in DNA - CysB complexes ( see below ) .
PCR - generated [ 32P ] DNA fragments were purified on 6 % polyacrylamide gels , electroeluted , and precipitated with ethanol .
Molar specific radioactivities of DNA fragments were assumed to be identical to those of the primers used for their synthesis , and chemical concentrations were calculated from estimates of radiolabel .
Specific activities ranged from 1,800 to 3,000 dpm/pmol of DNA fragment .
Binding reactions , electrophoresis , and gel processing .
DNA binding was studied by the gel shift method ( 13 , 17 ) .
Standard 20 - , ul binding - reaction mixtures contained 40 mM Tris hydrochloride ( pH 8.0 ) , 0.1 M KCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 100 , ug of bovine serum albumin ml - ' , and variable amounts of DNA and CysB .
Owing to a negative charge , which causes it to migrate away from complexes , N - acetyl - L-serine does not affect the electrophoretic migration of complexes between CysB and the cysK and cysP promoters , unless it is included in the electrophoresis buffer ( 24 , 39 ) .
O - Acetyl - L-serine , however , is a zwitterion and remains at the origin , where it slowly isomerizes and provides a steady stream of N - acetyl - L-serine migrating in the same direction as complexes .
Therefore , O - acetyl - L-serine was used as a source of N - acetyl - L-serine and was included at 10 mM where indicated .
After incubation for S min at 37 °C , a 2 - , lI volume of 50 % glycerol containing 0.1 % bromophenol blue was added with gentle mixing , and samples were immediately loaded onto a horizontal gel for electrophoresis .
For DNA - bending assays , the gel consisted of 5 % polyacrylamide ( acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio , 82:1 ) in 10 mM Tris hydrochloride ( pH 8.0 ) - i mM disodium EDTA and was prerun for 30 min at 3 V/cm .
Following electrophoresis for 60 to 80 min at 10 V/cm , the gel was dried onto filter paper , and radiolabeled bands were visualized by radioautography .
For measurements of stoichiometry , samples were electrophoresed for approximately 2 h in a 0.3 - cm - thick gel of 1.2 % NuSieve GTG low - melting - temperature agarose ( FMC Bio - Products ) in 50 mM Tris - 42 mM boric acid - 0.5 mM disodium EDTA ( pH 8.5 ) at 10 V/cm .
After the gels were stained with ethidium bromide , blocks of about 0.3 g containing DNA bands were cut out , placed in scintillation vials containing 1 ml of 0.2 N HCl , and melted by heating for 15 min at 90 °C .
After the mixture was cooled , 15 ml of Safety - Solve scintillation fluid ( Research Products International Corp. ) was added , and 35S and 32p were measured in a dual - channel scintillation counter an external standard .
Stock with correction for quenching by solutions of radiolabeled CysB and DNA were analyzed in a similar manner by adding a small volume to a vial containing 0.3 g of 1.2 % low - melting - temperature agarose that had been melted in 1 ml of 0.2 N HCl .
BINDING STOICHIOMETRY OF CysB PROTEIN 3675 In several experiments , binding - reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in horizontal gels containing 5 % polyacrylamidebisacrylamide ( 82:1 ) in 10 mM Tris hydrochloride - 1 mM disodium EDTA ( pH 8.0 ) .
DNA bands were visualized with ethidium bromide and cut out , and complexes were electroeluted into dialysis bags for measurements of 35S and 32p .
Promoter fragments for DNA - bending studies .
pCY4 and pCY7 are pBR322 derivatives containing a direct repeat of the 375 - bp region between the EcoRI and BamHI sites .
The two plasmids differ only in the orientation of a 20 - bp polylinker , which separates the repeated segments ( 48 ) .
A 190 - bp Sacl - BamHI fragment containing positions -144 to +31 of the S. typhimurium cysK promoter ( 6 , 39 ) was inserted into the polylinker Sacl and BglII sites of pCY7 to give pMHK9 .
The cysK promoter fragment was obtained from a pUC19 derivative and included 13 bp of pUC19 polylinker DNA on the Sacl end and 2 bp on the BamHI end .
A 187 - bp S. typhimurium cysP promoter fragment extending from positions -122 to +65 was generated by PCR and inserted into the SmaI site of pUC19 .
A recombinant in which the upstream portion of the insert was oriented toward the Sacl site of the vector was digested with Sacl and BamHI to give a 197 - bp fragment , which was then inserted into the Sacl and BglII sites of pCY4 to give pMHK17 .
pMHK9 was singly digested with either EcoRI , HindIII , BstNI , EcoRV , NheI , or BamHI to generate permuted fragments of 580 bp , within which the position of the cysK promoter insert differed by as much 378 bp .
pMHK17 was treated in the same way to generate 592 - bp fragments containing the cysP promoter .
All fragments were purified by electrophoresis in 1.2 % agarose , electroeluted , dephosphorylated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase , and 5 ' - end labeled with 32p .
RESULTS Stoichiometry of binding to the cysJIH promoter .
Our [ 35S ] CysB preparation was estimated to be approximately 85 % pure by SDS - PAGE , and titration with a cysP promoter fragment ( see below ) indicated that about 50 % of the total protein radiolabel was active in binding DNA .
Binding to the cysJIH promoter was studied with a 221 - bp fragment extending from positions -218 to +3 relative to the transcription start site , which was generated by PCR and 5 ' - end labeled with 32p .
Following electrophoresis in 1.2 % low - melting - temperature agarose , gel slices containing complexes were cut out , melted , and assayed for radiolabel to determine protein/DNA ratios .
A total of 13 different binding reactions were analyzed in three separate experiments .
A single complex was noted at 0.09 , uM CysB monomer , and additional slower complexes appeared at higher concentrations ( Fig. 2A ) .
These complexes were designated C - 1 , C - 2 , and C - 3 in order of their mobilities , with the C - 1 complex being the fastest .
As noted previously ( 29 ) , N - acetyl - L-serine ( provided as 10 mM O - acetyl - L-serine [ see Materials and Methods ] ) stimulated the formation of complexes but did not alter their mobilities .
Values for the molar ratio of CysB monomer to DNA in C - 1 complexes ranged from 3.0 to 5.1 with a mean of 4.2 ± 0.8 ( Table 1 ) without N - acetyl - L-serine and from 3.2 to 4.5 with a mean of 3.6 ± 0.4 with N - acetyl - L-serine .
These results indicate that CysB binds to the cysJIH promoter as a tetramer .
The mean values for the C - 2 complex were 8.5 ± 0.7 and 10.3 ± 0.7 monomers per DNA molecule without and with N - acetyl - L-serine , respectively , suggesting a stoichiometry of two CysB tetramers per DNA .
C - 3 complexes contained insufficient radiolabel for calculation of reliable ratios .
Stoichiometry of binding to the cysK promoter .
We measured binding to the cysK promoter with a 5 ' - end - labeled 236 - bp DNA fragment containing both CBS - Kl and CBS - K2 , which included promoter positions -144 to +31 plus a 61 - bp upstream segment consisting of pUC19 vector DNA .
As expected , N - acetyl - L-serine increased the mobility of the fastest - migrating complex , C - 1 , in both 1.2 % agarose ( Fig. 2A ) and 5 % polyacrylamide ( Fig. 2B ) gels , but this effect was very slight in agarose , probably because of the relatively large pore size of agarose gels ( 49 ) .
For 22 different binding reactions in five separate experiments , values for the molar ratio of CysB monomer to DNA in C - 1 complexes ranged between 3.0 and 5.4 with a mean of 4.0 ± 0.8 in the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine and between 3.0 and 4.6 with a mean of 3.7 ± 0.5 in the presence of N - acetyl - L - 3676 HRYNIEWICZ AND KREDICH A Promoter CysB Protein ( jM ) N - Acetylserine C - 3 Complexes - * - C - 2 Complexes - Po C - 1 Complexes - Free DNA - p - ... .

Gel shift binding studies in 1.2 % agarose ( A ) and 5 % polyacrylamide ( B ) .
The cysJIH and cysK promoters were included at 37 and 34 p.M , respectively , in panel A , and the cysK promoter was included at 41 , uM in panel B. Input values for CysB are shown in terms of monomer concentration .
N - acetyl - L-serine was provided as 10 mM O - acetyl - L-serine , which was added to incubation mixtures , and increased the mobilities of cysK promoter C - 1 complexes .
This effect was very slight in the agarose gels but was better appreciated in the polyacrylamide gels .
When analyzed separately , the two experiments in which complexes were electroeluted from polyacrylamide gels gave mean ratios of 4.9 and 4.2 without and with N - acetyl - L-serine , respectively .
These data indicate that the increased electrophoretic mobility of the C - 1 complex in the presence of N - acetyl - L-serine is not caused by binding of fewer CysB monomers and is consistent with a model in which this phenomenon is due to changes in DNA bending .
As in the case of the cysJIH promoter , CysB appears to bind to the cysK promoter as a tetramer .
C - 2 complexes had mean molar ratios of CysB monomer to DNA of 10.2 ± 0.7 and 9.2 + 1.8 without and with N - acetyl - L-serine , respectively , and are presumed to contain two CysB tetramers per DNA molecule .
The mobility of C - 2 complexes of the cysK promoter was not altered by N - acetyl - L-serine in either agarose or polyacrylamide gels .
Stoichiometry of binding to the cysP promoter .
Binding to the cysP promoter was studied by using a 5 ' - end - labeled 238 - bp fragment extending from promoter positions -173 to +65 .
N - Acetyl - L-serine stimulated binding slightly and increased the mobility of the C - 1 complex .
As in the case of the cysK promoter , the effect on mobility was more pronounced in polyacrylamide gels ( not shown ) .
For 23 different reactions in four separate experiments , values for the molar ratio of CysB monomer to DNA in complex C - 1 ranged between 2.9 and 5.1 with a mean of 3.8 ± 0.2 in the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine and between 2.8 and 4.7 with a mean of 3.4 ± 0.2 in the presence of N - acetyl - L-serine ( Table 1 ) .
Thus , CysB appears to bind to the cysP promoter as a tetramer , and N - acetyl - L-serine increases the mobility of the C - 1 complex without changing its stoichiometry .
In the single experiment in which C - 2 complexes could be quantified , ratios of 9.5 and 7.3 were obtained in the absence and presence of N - acetyl - L-serine , respectively , indicating that these complexes contain two CysB tetramers per DNA molecule .
Although it was not evident in gels used for stoichiometric measurements , other gel shift experiments have shown that N - acetyl - L-serine increases the mobility of cysP promoter C - 2 complexes in a manner similar to that found for C - 1 complexes ( not shown ) .
The concentration of active [ 35S ] CysB in our preparation was estimated from its capacity for binding a cysP promoter fragment under conditions of DNA excess with the assumption that the C - 1 and C - 2 complexes contained one and two tetramers , respectively .
Dissociation constants for C - 1 and C - 2 complexes were then calculated from initial DNA and CysB tetramer input values and from measurements of [ 32P ] DNA in free DNA and complexes .
Kd values for C - 1 complexes of the cysJIH promoter were 92 and 10 nM without and with N - acetyl - L-serine , respectively .
Kd values for C - 1 complexes of the cysK and cysP promoters were 16 and 15 nM , respectively , and were decreased to 4 and 5 nM , respectively , by N - acetyl - L-serine ( Table 2 ) .
Kd values for dissociation of C - 2 complexes to C - 1 complexes ranged between 81 and 225 nM for the three promoters .
N - Acetyl - L-serine increased this Kd value twofold for the cysJIH promoter , decreased it twofold for the cysK promoter , and had no significant effect with the cysP promoter .
CysB - induced bending of the cysK and cysP promoters .
The failure of N - acetyl - L-serine to alter significantly the stoichiometry of C - 1 complexes suggests that its effects on complex mobility are due to changes in CysB - induced DNA bending .
Since anomalously slow electrophoretic migration of bent DNA is most pronounced when the bend is located at the center of the fragment , the position of a bend point can be determined by comparing the mobilities of circularly permuted DNA fragments of identical length ( 63 ) .
In previous studies , we postulated bending of the cysK and cysP promoter complexes after comparing only two fragments of approximately equal length from each promoter ( 24 , 39 ) .
For more precise measurements , we constructed a set of six circularly permuted VOL .

The positions of the promoter inserts within a set of fragments varied over a range of 378 bp , i.e. , about 65 % of the total fragment length .
In the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine , complexes between these radiolabeled DNA fragments and nonradiolabeled CysB had electrophoretic mobilities that varied by as much as 35 % , depending on the position of the promoter relative to the midpoint of the fragment ( Fig. 3 ) .
N - Acetyl - L-serine increased complex mobility with each fragment , which we attribute to diminished DNA bending .
With saturating N - acetyl - L-serine ( 10 mM O - acetyl - L-serine ) , complex mobilities were still slightly position dependent , suggesting that the DNA was still bent but to a lesser extent .
Very small position - dependent variations in the mobilities of free DNA fragments were also noted but were not reproducible enough to quantify .
From plots of these data , we estimated bend point positions at -80 in the cysK promoter and -29 in the cysP promoter in the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine and at about -70 and -24 in the presence of N - acetyl - L-serine ( Fig. 3 ) .
These points lie between CBS - K1 and CBS - K2 in the cysK promoter and between CBS - Pt and CBS - P2 in the cysP promoter , i.e. , within CBS - 3 ( Fig. 1 ) .
Thompson and Landry ( 58 ) have estimated DNA bend angles from the relationship I1/R2 = cos ( o/2 ) , where [ is the electrophoretic mobility of a DNA fragment bent at its midpoint , ' 2 is the mobility when bent at the end or not bent at all , and ox is the deviation from linearity .
By assuming that the most rapidly migrating complex in the presence of N - acetyl - L-serine has a mobility that is very close to P2 , we calculated bend angles of 102 and 96 ° with the cysK and cysP promoters , respectively , in the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine and of approximately 50 ° for both promoters in the presence of N - acetyl - Lserine .

The electrophoretic mobilities of complexes ( Rf ) are expressed relative to the migration of free DNA .
The abscissa indicates the promoter position ( relative to the transcription start site ) that is present at the midpoint of a fragment ; e.g. , when position -251 of the cysK promoter was located at the middle of the fragment , the Rf values for complexes were 0.76 and 0.62 without and with N - acetyl - L-serine , respectively .
Bend point positions ( shown with arrows ) were estimated from the nadir of each curve .
DISCUSSION CysB binds as a tetramer .
The reliability of our stoichiometric measurements depends on the accuracy of our estimates of specific activities for CysB and cys promoter fragments .
For CysB , we used highly purified S - adenosylmethionine as a spectrophotometric standard for determining 35S specific activity and a sulfur content that is known precisely from the deduced amino - acid sequence ( 42 ) and from chemically determined peptide sequences that show retention of the aminoterminal methionine ( 37 ) .
DNA specific activities were based on E260 values for oligodeoxynucleotides that were calculated by summing the extinction coefficients for individual nucleotides , which does not take into account hypochromic effects in single - stranded oligonucleotides .
Cantor et al. ( 7 ) have proposed a theoretical method for predicting such hypochromicity but noted that calculated and experimental values can differ considerably .
If applied to our data , this method would lower e260 values by about 10 % and decrease estimates of stoichiometry from a range of 3.4 to 4.2 to a range of 3.1 to 3.8 CysB monomers per promoter in C - 1 complexes .
Although these ratios suggest the possibility of a trimeric binding unit , we believe that CysB most probably binds as a tetramer , which is the form observed in equilibrium sedimentation experiments with the noncomplexed protein ( 37 ) .
Our stoichiometric measurements allow us now to conclude that binding of a single CysB tetramer activates transcription .
With the cysJIH promoter , in - vitro - transcription activation by CysB and N - acetyl - L - serine occurs at low CysB concentrations ( -3 to 10 nM CysB tetramer ) that give only a one - protein complex ( 43 ) , which , J. BACTERIOL .
according to its DNase I footprint ( 39 ) , contains CysB bound to CBS - J .
The same reasoning can be applied to the cysK and cysP promoters , whose transcription activation is also maximal at CysB concentrations that give only one - protein complexes .
DNase I footprints indicate that these species contain CysB bound to either CBS - K1 alone or CBS - P1 alone in the presence of N - acetyl - L-serine ( 24 , 39 ) .
For the cysK promoter this conclusion is also supported by the fact that in - vivo cysK promoter function is unaffected by deletion of CBS - K2 but markedly or totally diminished by the loss of small portions of CBS - K1 ( 39 ) .
In the case of the cysP promoter , one - protein complexes in the presence of N - acetyl - L-serine are most likely to contain CysB at CBS - P1 , which has a sixfold - greater binding affinity than CBS - P2 ( 24 ) .
A model for bending of the cysK and cysP promoters .
The failure of N - acetyl - L-serine to change the stoichiometry of one - protein complexes with the cysK and cysP promoters indicates that it alters complex mobilities by changing DNA bending .
Our gel shift studies with circularly permuted DNA fragments confirm this conclusion and suggest that a single CysB tetramer bends the cysK and cysP promoters by approximately 1000 and that N - acetyl - L-serine decreases this angle to about 500 .
DNase I footprinting experiments have shown that without N - acetyl - L-serine , CysB protects a region of approximately 77 bp that includes CBS - K2 , the bend point , and most of CBS - K1 ( 39 ) .
Binding to this large a region by a single CysB protein is much easier to envision with bent DNA , since the diameter of a 144 - kDa tetramer , if perfectly spherical , is 7 nm , which is equivalent to the length of only 21 bp of B - form DNA .
Our interpretation of these data is summarized in Fig. 4 , which shows a single CysB tetramer binding simultaneously to both CBS - K1 and CBS - K2 in the cysK promoter and bending the DNA at or near the junction between the two binding sites .
CysB induces a similar bend in the cysP promoter by binding to CBS - P3 , which overlaps CBS - P1 and CBS - P2 and includes 21 bp separating these two sites ( Fig. 1 and 4 ) ( 24 ) .
In our model , N - acetyl - L-serine decreases bending by causing CysB to bind only to a single site , either CBS - K1 or CBS - P1 , and these species activate transcription initiation .
In the cysK promoter , the bending that results from binding of a single CysB tetramer to CBS - K1 and CBS - K2 simultaneously can be considered a kind of DNA looping ( 55 ) , albeit with a very small loop of only the few base pairs that separate these sites .
By analogy with araC ( 34 , 54 ) , inducer prevents bending or looping through differential effects on binding affinity , in this case stimulation of binding to CBS - K1 and inhibition of binding to CBS - K2 ( 39 ) .
The basis for these opposite effects of N - acetyl - L-serine is not understood .
In the cysP promoter , N - acetyl - L-serine prevents binding to CBS - P3 while stimulating binding to CBS - P1 .
N - Acetyl - L-serine also stimulates binding to CBS - P2 ( 24 ) , but the topographic relationship between the binding faces occupied at CBS - Pl and CBS - P2 , as revealed by hydroxyl radical footprinting ( 24a ) , probably prevents binding of a single CysB to both simultaneously .
Functional significance of CysB - induced DNA bending .
DNA curvature has been observed or predicted from sequence data in the upstream regions of a number of promoters , where it is believed to play an important role in increasing transcription rates .
Sequences upstream of the -35 regions of such promoters generally contain phased tracts of A , or Tn ( 2 , 4 , 27 , 36 , 47 ) , which are known to favor intrinsic DNA bending ( 29 ) .
In addition , induced DNA bending is thought to be a significant factor in the mechanism of a number of transcriptional activators ( 46 , 59 ) , of which the most extensively studied is the E. coli catabolite gene activator protein ( CAP ) ( reviewed in reference 28 ) .
CAP positively regulates and induces bends in VOL .

BINDING STOICHIOMETRY OF CysB PROTEIN 3679 Two - protein Complexes with N - acetylserine I transcription activation FIG. 4 .
Model for interactions of the cysK and cysP promoters with CysB and N - acetyl - L-serine .
In the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine , a single CysB tetramer binds to both the CBS - K1 and CBS - K2 sites of the cysK promoter or to CBS - P3 in the cysP promoter .
Both promoters are bent by about 1000 to allow contact with CysB over an expanse of about 50 to 80 bp .
N - Acetyl - L-serine alters CysB so that a single tetramer can no longer simultaneously bind to CBS - K1 and CBS - K2 or to CBS - P3 , thereby decreasing the angle of DNA bending to about 50 ° .
The resultant one - protein complexes contain CysB bound at either CBS - KI or CBS - P1 and can activate transcription initiation .
With higher CysB concentrations and N - acetyl - L-serine , a second tetramer can bind to either CBS - K2 or CBS - P2 , giving two - protein complexes in which the shape of the DNA ( shown as slightly bent ) is not known .
Two - protein complexes also occur without N - acetyl - L-serine ( not shown ) .
the lac and gal promoters , and the introduction of artificial intrinsic bends in these promoters can obviate the need for CAP in transcription activation ( 5 , 18 ) .
Interpretation of these findings is complicated , however , by the fact that contacts between CAP and RNA polymerase appear to be essential for transcription activation by CAP at the lac promoter ( 10 , 26 , 64 ) and that certain mutant CAP proteins that are defective in transcription activation can still bend DNA ( 64 ) .
Whether intrinsic or induced , increased DNA curvature is thought to distort the promoter in a manner that facilitates interactions with RNA polymerase .
It is of interest in this regard that Ross et al. ( 50 ) have demonstrated that the RNA polymerase cx subunit , both as part of the holoenzyme and as an isolated dimer , binds to the E. coli rnBpl promoter at an A+T - rich upstream activator element situated in the -60 to -40 region ( 21 , 40 ) .
This element is responsible for a 30 - fold increase in rnBp , core promoter activity , which is not observed with RNA polymerases reconstituted from certain mutant a ( subunits .
Many promoters contain A+T - rich sequences at or near the -44 region ( 15 ) , some of which have been shown directly or indirectly to increase transcription activity ( 1 , 9 , 14 , 21 , 40 ) .
Ross et al. ( 50 ) suggest that either increased DNA curvature or an A+T - rich upstream region may facilitate contact with the ot subunit and thereby stimulate transcription .
For some promoters these attributes are intrinsic , whereas in others DNA bending must be induced by binding of a transcription activator .
In the case of CysB , the significance of induced DNA bending in transcription activation is not clear , since bend points lie outside of the -60 to -40 region , i.e. , at position -80 or -70 in the cysK promoter and at -29 or -24 in the cysP promoter .
Furthermore , bend angles are decreased from about 100 to 50 ° by inducer , and elimination of the 1000 bend through deletion of CBS - K2 does not affect in - vivo expression from the cysK promoter ( 39 ) .
We can not discount , however , the possibility that the residual bending observed with N - acetyl - L-serine is important for transcription activation , either by facilitating contacts with the RNA polymerase at subunit or by some other mechanism , particularly for the cysK promoter , since the rrnBpl upstream activation element has been shown to continue to function when displaced further upstream by a full helical turn , i.e. , to positions -71 to -51 ( 41 ) .
We currently favor the notion that the 1000 bending of the cysK and cysP promoters functions to increase contacts between CysB and promoters , with a resultant increase in binding affinity that helps to sequester CysB at its promoters , particularly when sulfur is replete and N - acetyl - L-serine levels are low .
The Kd values for C - 1 complexes in the absence of N - acetyl - L - serine are virtually identical for the cysK and cysP promoters , which bend and allow contact with adjacent binding sites , and are approximately sixfold higher for the cysJIH promoter ( Table 2 ) .
In contrast , Kd values for all three promoters vary only twofold in the presence of N - acetyl - L-serine , which favors binding to a single site .
Although we did not determine an individual binding constant for CBS - P1 in the experiments reported here , a previous semiquantitative study indicated that the affinity of CysB for the entire cysP promoter region in the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine is about fivefold greater than for a DNA fragment containing CBS - P1 alone ( 24 ) .
Extrapolation of the data reported here gives a Kd of about 75 nM for CBS - P1 alone in the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine , which is close to the value of 92 nM estimated for CBS - J in the cysJIH promoter ( Table 2 ) .
Thus , the higher affinities of CysB for the cysK and cysP promoters may be related more to the presence of secondary binding sites than to differences in affinities between the transcription activator sites CBS - P1 , CBS - K1 , and CBS - J .
We believe that the cysK promoter 3680 HRYNIEWICZ AND KREDICH TABLE 2 .

The Kd values for C - 2 complexes are for dissociation of a two - protein complex to a one - protein complex .
The number of determinations is given as n. Data were obtained from the experiments shown in Table 1 .
b NAS , N - acetyl - L-serine ( provided as 10 mM O - acetyl - L-serine ) .
two - protein complexes noted with and without N - acetyl - Lserine contain CysB proteins bound separately to CBS - K1 and CBS - K2 ( Fig. 4 ) .
Steric hindrance would probably prevent binding of a second CysB to a complex already containing CysB bound to both sites , and if such a complex were formed , we would expect its electrophoretic mobility to increase with N - acetyl - L-serine , which it does not .
N - Acetyl - L-serine could inhibit two - protein complex formation by decreasing the affinity of CysB for CBS - K2 , or it might favor such a complex by causing the first CysB to bind to CBS - K1 alone , thereby freeing CBS - K2 for further occupancy .
Our finding that N - acetyl - Lserine decreases the Kd for the two - protein complex ( Table 2 ) indicates that the stimulatory effect is stronger .
The ability of N - acetyl - L-serine to increase the electrophoretic mobility of the two - protein complex of the cysP promoter suggests that , in the absence of this effector , it contains CysB at CBS - P3 .
The second CysB could be bound to CBS - P2 , which overlaps CBS - P3 by only 6 bp and lies on the opposite face of the DNA helix ( 24a ) .
Since N - acetyl - L-serine inhibits binding to CBS - P3 and stimulates binding to CBS - P1 and CBS - P2 , the two - protein complex noted in the presence of this effector probably contains a separate CysB tetramer at each of the last two sites ( Fig. 4 ) .
The three - protein complexes found with the cysK and cysP promoters may represent nonspecific binding or binding to additional specific sites that we have not identified .
The twoand three - protein complexes noted with the cysJIH promoter may also result from nonspecific binding or from binding to two additional specific sites recently detected in hydroxyl radical footprints ( 24a ) .
Preliminary data indicate that the topography of these cysJIH promoter sites should prohibit a single CysB tetramer from binding to two of them simultaneously .
Significance for other LysR transcriptional activators .
To our knowledge , studies of binding stoichiometry have not been reported for any member of the LysR family , even though several proteins have been purified to homogeneity and their DNA - binding targets have been identified by footprinting .
Our finding that only a single CysB tetramer binds to a 45 - bp site may be indicative of a common attribute of LysR - type proteins in recognizing large binding sites , which have been reported to be between 36 and 55 bp for OxyR ( 56 ) , AmpR ( 33 ) , NodD ( 11 ) , NahR ( 25 , 53 ) , and OccR ( 61 ) .
In addition , OccR , a transcription activator required for octopine metabolism in cells infected by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ( 22 ) , has been shown to bend its DNA target in - vitro , and its coactivator , octopine , reduces the bend angle from about 62 to 460 while shortening the DNase I footprint by 7 to 8 bp ( 61 ) .
NodD has also been reported to bend DNA ( 12 ) .
It will be interesting to see whether DNA bending by these LysR - type proteins is also mediated by a single oligomeric protein .
