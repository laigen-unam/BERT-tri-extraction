174 , No. 2 Regulation of the Salmonella typhimurium metA Gene by the MetR Protein and Homocysteine ROSALEE MARES , MARK L. URBANOWSKI , AND GEORGE V. STAUFFER * Department of Microbiology , University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa 52242 The DNA sequence of the Salmonella typhimurium metA control region is presented .
S1 - nuclease - mapping was used to determine the transcription initiation site .
By measuring 0 - galactosidase levels in Escherichia coli strains lysogenized with phage carrying a metA - lacZ gene fusion , the MetR protein was shown to activate the metA gene .
Homocysteine , an intermediate in methionine biosynthesis , plays a negative role in the MetRmediated activation mechanism .
Gel mobility - shift assays and DNase - I-protection experiments showed that the MetR protein binds to a DNA fragment carrying the metA control region and protects a 26 - bp region beginning 9 bp upstream of the -35 promoter sequence .
In Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , the first step in the biosynthesis of methionine is the conversion of homoserine to O - succinylhomoserine by homoserine succinyltransferase , the metA gene product ( Fig. 1 ) ( for a review , see reference 21 ) .
The metA gene , as well as all of the other methionine biosynthetic genes except metH , is negatively regulated by the MetJ repressor , with S - adenosylmethionine acting as a corepressor .
In addition to MetJ - mediated repression , at least two genes , the metE and metH genes , are activated by MetR , a DNA - binding protein ( 4 , 28 ) .
Although homocysteine is required for the MetR - mediated activation of the metE gene , homocysteine plays an inhibitory role in the MetR - mediated activation of the metH gene ( 5 , 29 ) .
In S. typhmurium metE mutants , the metA gene is not expressed during methionine - limited growth ( 22 ) .
Since homocysteine is expected to accumulate in metE mutants ( Fig. 1 ) and plays a negative role in the MetR - mediated activation of the metH gene , we tested whether homocysteine also plays a negative role in regulation of the S. typhimurium metA gene .
We show here that the metA gene is positively regulated by the MetR protein and that homocysteine plays an inhibitory role in this MetR - mediated activation .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains , bacteriophages , and plasmids .
All bacterial strains used in this study are derivatives of E. coli K - 12 and are described in Table 1 .

Other plasmids and phages were isolated during this investigation .
Luria agar and glucose minimal - medium ( GM ) have been described previously ( 25 ) .
GM was supplemented with vitamin - B1 ( 1 pLg/ml ) and phenylalanine ( 50 p.g / ml ) , since most strains carry the pheA905 and thi mutations .

Procedures for the isolation of DNA , * restriction enzyme digestion , ligation , and bacterial transformation have been described previously ( 14 ) .
Construction of plasmids containing the metA gene .
S. typhimurium chromosomal DNA ( 25 , ug ) was cut with the restriction enzyme EcoRI under partial digestion conditions , the DNA was electrophoresed on a 0.8 % low - melting - temperature agarose gel , and fragments of about 35 to 45 kb were isolated ( 14 ) .
The DNA fragments were ligated into the EcoRI site of the cosmid vector pMF7 ( 1 , ug ) .
The ligated DNA was ethanol precipitated and dissolved in 12 RI of TE buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 ] , 1 mM EDTA ) , and a 4 - p .
l aliquot was packaged with a Gigapack Gold A DNA packaging kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , Calif. ) .
The packaged DNA was used to infect strain GS765 ( hsdR4 hsdM + metA28 ) , and the cells were plated on a GM plate supplemented with - ampicillin .
Plasmid DNA was isolated from one Met ' Apr ( ampicillin - resistant ) transformant and designated pGS233 .
An EcoRI digest of pGS233 showed the presence of several EcoRI fragments .
To reduce the size of the original insert , plasmid pGS233 was digested with EcoRI , and the DNA fragments were ligated into the EcoRI site of plasmid pBR322 .
The ligation mixture was used to transform the metA mutant strain AB1927 , and the transformed cells were plated on a GM plate supplemented with purines , arginine , and tetracycline .
Plasmid DNA was isolated from one Met ' Tcr ( tetracycline - resistant ) transformant and designated pGS234 .
An EcoRI digest showed that plasmid pGS234 carries a single EcoRI insert fragment of about 28 kb .
To further reduce the size of the cloned DNA , a restriction map of this plasmid was determined ( data not shown ) .
Three AseI sites were located within the cloned fragment .
Plasmid pGS234 was digested with EcoRI and AseI , and the fragments were ligated into the AseI and EcoRI sites of plasmid pBR322 .
The ligated mixture was used to transform the metA mutant strain AB1927 , and the transformed cells were plated on a GM plate supplemented with arginine , purines , and tetracycline .

gene was isolated from plasmid pGS235 .
This fragment was ligated into the lac fusion vector pMC1403 , which had been cut with XmaI and whose ends had been filled in with deoxynucleoside triphosphates and the large fragment of DNA polymerase I .
The reading frame of the metA gene and the lacZ gene are maintained in this fusion .

All other strains were constructed in our laboratory .
In addition to the genotypes shown , all strains except AB1927 and GS765 carry the pheA905 , thi , A1acU169 , araD129 , and rpsL mutations .
This phage , designated AAlac , was then used to lysogenize appropriate bacterial strains as described previously ( 26 ) .
Lysogens were tested for a single copy of AAlac phage by infection with phage XcI90c17 ( 24 ) .
P - Galactosidase activity was measured by the chloroform - sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis procedure described by Miller ( 17 ) .
The results are averages of two or more assays in which the values were determined in triplicate for each assay .
The gel mobility - shift assay was based on the methods of Fried and Crothers ( 11 ) and Gamer and Revzin ( 12 ) .
Plasmid pAlac was digested with EcoRI and BamHI , and approximately 0.25 , ug of the digested DNA was added to 20 - , ul reaction mixtures containing DNA - binding buffer ( DBB ; 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7.5 ] , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol , 1 mM dithiothreitol ) plus 125 , ug of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) per ml and , where indicated , 1 mM L - homocysteine .
The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C .
Next , 2 pdl of purified S. typhimurium MetR protein ( 3 ) in 2x DBB plus 125 , ug of BSA per ml in a twofold dilution series ranging from 0.8 to 0.1 pug of protein was added , and incubation was continued for 15 min at 37 °C .
One microliter of dye mix ( 0.1 % xylene cyanol and 50 % glycerol in H20 ) was added to each reaction mixture , and the samples were loaded immediately onto a 5 % polyacrylamide gel ( bisacrylamide - acrylamide [ 1/30 ] buffered with 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7.4 ] , 0.38 M glycine , and 1 mM EDTA ) .
The gel was prerun at 9 V/cm for 1 h prior to loading .
The DNase - I-protection assay is based on the method of Schmitz and Galas ( 23 ) with modifications .
Plasmid pAlac , which carries the metA control region , was digested with BamHI and labeled at the 3 ' ends with [ cX - 32P ] dGTP and T7 DNA polymerase .
The labeled DNA was digested with EcoRI , and a 527 - bp fragment carrying the metA control region was isolated by gel electrophoresis ( 14 ) .
A 114 - pd reaction mixture containing the labeled fragment in DBB plus 125 , g of BSA per ml was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C .
Twelve microliters of MetR protein ( 9.6 , ug ) in 2x DBB plus 125 , ug of BSA per ml or 2x DBB alone was added , and the mixtures were incubated for an additional 15 min at 37 °C .
Six microliters of DNase I ( 1.25 , ug/ml dissolved in 20 mM sodium acetate [ pH 71 - 32 mM CaCl2 ) was added to the reaction mixtures , and incubation was continued for 30 s .
The digestions were stopped with 25 ptl of DNase I stop mix ( 3 M ammonium acetate , 0.25 M EDTA , 15 pug of sonicated calf thymus DNA per ml ) , and the mixtures were precipitated with ethanol .
The DNase I digestion products were resuspended in sequencing dye mix and run alongside the Maxam - Gilbert sequencing reaction mixtures of the DNA probe .
The Si nuclease mapping procedure of Weaver and Weissmann ( 31 ) was used with minor modifications .
Plasmid pAlac was digested with EcoRI and BamHI , and the 527 - bp EcoRI - BamHI DNA fragment containing the metA control region was isolated and labeled at the 5 ' ends with [ y - 32P ] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase ( 14 ) .
The two strands were then separated on an 8 % polyacrylamide gel , and the strand complementary to the metAlacZ transcript was isolated and used as a probe ( 15 ) .
Total cellular RNA was isolated as described previously ( 1 ) .
Twenty micrograms of total cellular RNA was precipitated along with an aliquot of the 32P - labeled single - stranded DNA probe .
The DNA pellets were resuspended in 10 plI of hybridization buffer -LCB- ( 0.4 M NaCl , 0.04 M PIPES [ piperazine - N , N ' - bis ( 2 - ethanesulfonic - acid ) ; pH 6.4 ] , 1 mM EDTA -RCB- , heated to 90 °C for 2 min , and then allowed to hybridize at 65 °C for 1 h .
A 100 - pd portion of cold Si nuclease buffer ( 0.25 M NaCl , 0.06 M sodium acetate [ pH 4.6 ] , 1 mM ZnSO4 , 5 % glycerol ) and 300 U of Si nuclease were added , and digestion was carried out at 20 °C for 1 h .
The Si nuclease - resistant products were then precipitated and electrophoresed on a DNA sequencing gel adjacent to the Maxam and Gilbert G sequencing reaction ladder of the DNA probe .
The optical density of each band from the Si nuclease mapping autoradiogram was measured with a scanning densitometer .
The results from the scanning densitometer were quantified by cutting out and weighing peaks representing each band in photocopies of the tracings .
The percentages were calculated by comparing the ratio of the weight of the band from each lane to the weight of the band from 719XAlac without homocysteine .
Nucleotide sequence accession number .
The nucleotide sequence data reported have been deposited with the Gen - Bank nucleotide sequence data base under accession number M74188 .
Sequence of the metA control region .
The metA gene was initially cloned on an EcoRI DNA fragment in cosmid vector pMF7 and subsequently subcloned on a 3.4 - kb AseI - EcoRI DNA fragment into plasmid pBR322 ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The location and orientation of the metA gene in this fragment was determined as follows .
A physical map of the fragment was prepared and compared with the physical map deduced from the sequence of the E. coli metA gene ( 16 ) .
Several restriction enzyme sites appeared to be common to the E. coli metA gene and the 3.4 - kb AseI - EcoRI fragment carrying the S. typhimurium metA gene .
A 207 - bp sequence near an AlwNI site , deduced to be near the metA promoter , was determined and compared with the E. coli metA sequence .
The sequence showed 90 % homology with the E. coli metA structural gene sequence ( 16 ) .
The DNA sequence was then extended to include the metA control region and the beginning of the metA structural gene ( Fig. 2 ) .
Regulation of a metA - lacZ gene fusion .
To facilitate regulatory studies , we constructed a XAlac phage which carries a metA - lacZ gene fusion ( see Materials and Methods ) .
This fusion encodes a chimeric P - galactosidase whose synthesis is directed by the transcriptional and translational signals of the metA control region .
The XAlac phage was used to lysogenize strains GS162 ( wild type ) , GS718 ( metB ) , and GS597 ( metJ ) .
The metB mutation results in methionine auxotrophy and should cause overexpression of metA during methionine - limited growth .
The lysogens 162XAlac , 718XAlac , and 597XAlac were grown in GM and , where indicated , supplemented with either L - methionine ( repressing condition ) or D - methionine , and , - galactosidase levels were measured ( D - methionine is converted to L - methionine by the cells and serves as a limiting source of methionine [ 13 ] ) .
Expression of the metA - lacZ fusion was derepressed about eight - and sevenfold in the wild - type lysogen 162XAlac grown in GM or GM supplemented with D - methionine , respectively , compared with L - methionine ( Table 2 ) .
Expression of the metA - lacZ fusion was derepressed 44 - fold in the metB lysogen 718XAlac grown in the presence of D - methionine in comparison with L - methionine .
Expression of the metA - lacZ fusion was further elevated in the metJ lysogen 597XAlac , and L - methionine did not significantly repress expression of the fusion .
These results are consistent with the MetJ - mediated repression reported previously for the VOL .

intact S. typhimurium metA gene ( 22 ) , indicating that the XAlac fusion is regulated normally .
Effect of homocysteine on metA - lacZ expression .
Homocysteine has been shown to play a positive role in MetRmediated activation of the metE gene but a negative role in activation of the metH gene ( 29 ) .
To determine whether homocysteine is involved in regulation of metA gene expression , the XAlac phage was used to lysogenize strain GS719 ( metJ metB ) .
This strain does not accumulate high levels of homocysteine because of the metB mutation ( Fig. 1 ) , and it can be used to test the effect of homocysteine supplementation on the expression of the metA - lacZ gene fusion .
However , homocysteine can not be completely eliminated because of the cyclical branch of the methionine pathway ( Fig. 1 ) .
The metJ mutation eliminates changes in P - galactosidase TABLE 2 .

levels being mediated by the MetJ repressor .
Lysogen 719AAlac was grown in GM supplemented with D - methionine or D - methionine plus homocysteine , and 3 - galactosidase levels were determined .
In lysogen 719XAlac , homocysteine supplementation resulted in about a 2.4 - fold decrease in 3 - galactosidase activity ( Table 3 ) .
The XAlac phage was also used to lysogenize strains GS722 ( metJ metB metF ) and GS747 ( metJ metB metE ) .
The metE and metF mutations should result in the accumulation of intracellular levels of homocysteine ( 8 ) through the cyclical regenerative branch of the methionine pathway ( Fig. 1 ) .
When lysogens 722AAlac and 747AAlac were grown in GM plus D - methionine , , - galactosidase levels were significantly reduced compared with lysogen 719AAlac ( Table 3 ) .
The addition of homocysteine to the growth medium resulted in a small but reproducible decrease in , - galactosidase levels .
These results suggest that homocysteine has an inhibitory role in the regulation of the metA - 1acZ gene fusion .
Effect of the MetR protein on metA - lacZ expression .
To determine whether the MetR protein mediates the inhibitory effect of homocysteine on metA - lacZ expression , strains GS719 ( metJ metB ) , GS748 ( metJ metR ) , and GS761 ( metJ metB metR ) were lysogenized with the XAlac phage .
These lysogens were grown in GM supplemented with D - methionine or D - methionine plus homocysteine , and P - galactosidase levels were determined .
In the metR lysogens 748AAlac and 761XAlac grown in GM supplemented with D - methionine , P - galactosidase levels were about 2.9 - and 3.1 - fold lower than in the metR + lysogen 719XAlac ( Table 4 ) .
Homocysteine supplementation still resulted in a small but reproducible decrease in 3 - galactosidase levels in these lysogens .
Expression of the metE gene requires a functional MetR protein ( 30 ) .
Thus , metR mutants are phenotypically like metE mutants .
Since homocysteine would be expected to accumulate to high levels in metR mutants , it is possible that the reduced 3 - galactosidase levels in the metR lysogens TABLE 4 .

Gel mobility - shift assay for binding of MetR protein to the metA control region .
Plasmid pAlac , which contains the metA control region , was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and then incubated with various dilutions of MetR protein to allow specific protein - DNA complexes to form .
The samples were then electrophoresed on a nondenaturing 5 % polyacrylamide gel .
The effect of homocysteine on DNA - MetR complexes was determined by adding 1 mM L - homocysteine to the binding reaction mixtures .
Lanes 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 , twofold dilutions of purified MetR protein from 0.8 to 0.1 , ug ; lanes 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 , twofold dilutions of purified MetR protein from 0.8 to 0.1 , ug and 1 mM L - homocysteine ; lane 9 , no MetR protein ; lane 10 , 1 mM L - homocysteine and no MetR protein .
The arrow indicates the position of the DNA - MetR complex .
748XAlac and 761AAlac are due to high intracellular levels of homocysteine rather than to the absence of a functional MetR protein .
To determine which of these possibilities is most likely , lysogen 761XAlac was transformed with plasmid pGS69 , a multicopy plasmid containing the S. typhimurium metE gene ( 30 ) .
Although the metE gene is expressed at only about 5 % of the wild - type level in metR mutants , the multiple copies of the metE gene in the transformed cells provide sufficient homocysteine transmethylase levels to utilize homocysteine produced by the cyclical pathway .
Thus , if high intracellular homocysteine were responsible for decreased metA - lacZ expression in the metR mutants , , B - galactosidase levels would be expected to increase in lysogen 761XAlac ( pGS69 ) .
As shown in Table 4 , , - galactosidase levels in lysogen 761XAlac ( pGS69 ) were not changed significantly from those in the untransformed cells , suggesting that the MetR protein is required for full metA - lacZ gene expression .
Binding of the MetR protein to the metA control region .
The MetR protein has been shown to activate metE gene expression by binding to metE promoter region DNA ( 4 , 28 ) .
A gel mobility - shift assay was used to determine whether the MetR protein binds to the metA control region and whether homocysteine contributes to the binding of this protein .
Plasmid pAlac was digested with EcoRI and BamHI to generate a 527 - bp EcoRI - BamHI fragment containing the metA control region .
The DNA was incubated with or without MetR protein and with or without 1 mM L - homocysteine ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The protein - DNA complexes were then analyzed on a nondenaturing 5 % polyacrylamide gel .
The addition of the MetR protein shifted the normal mobility of the DNA fragment to a more slowly migrating form ( Fig. 3 , lanes 1 to 8 ) .
As the amount of MetR protein decreased from 0.8 to 0.1 R , g , a decreasing amount of the DNA fragment was shifted .
The addition of 1 mM L - homocysteine did not significantly alter the affinity of binding of the MetR protein to the DNA .
Protection from DNase I digestion of the metA control region by the purified MetR protein .
The 32P - labeled 527 - bp metA DNA probe was incubated with ( lane 2 ) or without ( lane 1 ) 9.6 , ug of purified MetR protein and then subjected to partial DNase I digestion .
The reaction mixtures were run alongside Maxam and Gilbert sequencing reaction mixtures of the same DNA fragment .
The region of the probe protected from DNase I digestion is indicated by the bracket and is shown in Fig. 2 .
Location of the MetR - binding site .
A DNase - I-protection assay was used to locate the binding site for the MetR protein on the 527 - bp EcoRI - BamHI DNA fragment carrying the metA control region ( see Materials and Methods ) .
As shown in Fig. 4 , the MetR protein protected a 26 - bp region from DNase I attack ( lane 2 ) .
This region was not protected in the absence of MetR protein ( lane 1 ) .
The sequence protected by the bound MetR protein is indicated by the bracket in Fig. 2 .
Transcriptional regulation of the metA gene .
To determine whether regulation of the metA - lacZ gene fusion by the MetR protein and homocysteine occurs at the transcriptional level , an Si nuclease assay was used to measure relative levels of metA - lacZ mRNA ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The cellular RNA used was prepared from lysogens 719XAlac and 761XAlac grown in GM supplemented either with D - methionine or with D - methionine plus homocysteine .
The results are shown in Fig. 5 .
The relative amounts of metA - lacZ mRNA were quantitated from the autoradiogram by densitometry ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Transcriptional regulation of the metA - 1acZ gene fusion by the MetR protein and homocysteine .
Lysogens 719XAlac and 761XAlac were grown in GM supplemented with either D - methionine or D - methionine plus homocysteine and were used to prepare total cellular RNA .
Equal amounts of RNA from each culture were hybridized to a 32P - labeled DNA probe containing the S. typhimurium metA control region and then digested with S1 nuclease .
The Si nuclease - resistant products ( arrow ) were run on a DNA sequencing gel adjacent to the G sequencing reaction mixture of Maxam and Gilbert ( 15 ) .
Lane 1 , 719XAlac grown with D - methionine ; lane 2 , 719AAlac grown with D - methionine plus DL - homocysteine ; lane 3 , 761XAlac grown with D - methionine ; lane 4 , 761XAlac grown with D - methionine plus DL - homocysteine .
719XAlac , the addition of homocysteine resulted in about a fourfold decrease in metA - lacZ mRNA ( Fig. 5 ; compare lanes 1 and 2 ) .
For lysogen 761XAlac , grown either with or without homocysteine , there was a 9 - to 10 - fold decrease in metA - lacZ mRNA compared with 719AAlac grown with D - methionine ( Fig. 5 ; compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and 4 ) .
These results suggest that homocysteine and the MetR protein control metA - lacZ gene expression at the level of transcription .
DISCUSSION The S. typhimurium metA gene was cloned , and the nucleotide sequence of the control region and the beginning of the structural gene was determined ( Fig. 2 ) .
The sequence determined is similar to that of the metA control region from E. coli ( 16 ) and allowed us to predict the promoter region and metA REGULATION 395 translation start site .
The -10 and -35 promoter sequence elements are identical in E. coli ( 16 ) and S. typhimurium and show matches of 4 and 5 out of 6 bp with the promoter consensus sequences ( 20 ) , respectively .
From Si nuclease mapping ( Fig. 5 ) , it was deduced that transcription initiates 6 bases downstream from the proposed -10 sequence .
This is the same transcription start site found in E. coli .
A second transcriptional start site reported for the E. coli metA gene ( 16 ) at position -76 was not found in S. typhimurium by Si nuclease mapping .
The translation start codon is preceded by a 48 - base leader transcript .
A AAlac phage carrying a metA - lacZ gene fusion ( AAlac ) was constructed in order to study regulation of the metA gene .
In the wild - type lysogen 162AAlac , methionine repressed metA - lacZ expression about 8 - fold ( Table 2 ) , whereas in the metB lysogen 718Alac , methionine repressed expression 44 - fold .
In the metJ lysogen 597XAlac , methionine - mediated repression was lost ( Table 2 ) .
These results indicate that the metA - lacZ gene fusion is expressed from the normal metA control region .
Homocysteine has been shown to play a positive role in MetR - mediated activation of the metE gene and a negative role in activation of the metH gene ( 29 ) .
In the metJ metB lysogen 719XAlac , which does not accumulate high levels of homocysteine because of the metB mutation , homocysteine supplementation of the medium resulted in a 2.4 - fold decrease in P - galactosidase levels ( Table 3 ) .
In lysogens 722XAlac and 747XAlac , the metF and metE mutations result in the accumulation of intracellular homocysteine produced endogenously from S - adenosylmethionine by the cyclical branch of the methionine pathway ( Fig. 1 ) .
These strains have low , - galactosidase levels without homocysteine supplementation .
The addition of homocysteine , however , still results in a small but reproducible decrease in P - galactosidase levels .
We have no explanation for why this additional decrease occurs .
The results indicate that homocysteine plays an inhibitory role in metA - lacZ expression .
In the metJ metR lysogen 748AAlac and the metJ metB metR lysogen 761AAlac , where the MetR protein is inactivated , metA expression is decreased 2.9 - to 3.1 - fold ( Table 4 ) .
Since metR mutants behave phenotypically like metE mutants and are expected to accumulate high intracellular levels of homocysteine , the decrease in P - galactosidase synthesis in the metR lysogens could be due to an absence of the MetR protein , high homocysteine levels , or both .
However , when the metJ metB metR lysogen 761XAlac was transformed with the multicopy plasmid pGS69 , which carries the S. typhimurium metE gene , P - galactosidase levels were essentially the same as in the untransformed cells grown in GM plus D - methionine ( Table 4 ) .
The multiple copies of metE provide enough homocysteine transmethylase to keep intracellular homocysteine concentrations low .
These results suggest that the MetR protein is a positive activator of the metA gene .
It should be noted that in the metR lysogens , homocysteine addition to the growth medium still results in a small but reproducible decrease in P - galactosidase levels .
It is possible that part of the homocysteine effect occurs via a second mechanism independent of the MetR protein .
Although the MetR protein appears to serve as a positive regulator for the metA gene , its absence does not completely eliminate metA - lacZ expression ( Table 4 ) .
Similar results are also observed for MetR - mediated activation of the E. coli glyA gene ( 19 ) and the S. typhimurium metH gene ( 27 ) .
This is consistent with previous reports that although metR mutants reduce metE gene expression sufficiently to cause 396 MARES ET AL. metE metH metA -61 -35 TTCGATCATGAAAGTCCTTCACTTCGCCATGAACAAATTGCGCTTGAGG -56 -35 TGGCAAGCTGAACATGTCTCATGTTGCCCGTTGTTCTCTTTTCC -57 -35 TGCTGTCGTGAAACTTTCTCACCTTGAACTTGCAGACTCGACA FIG. 6 .
Comparison of the 26 - bp MetR - binding sites from the S. typhimurium metE ( 28 ) , metH ( 27 ) , and metA genes .
The interrupted palindromes are underlined , and the -35 promoter regions are overlined .
The number at the center of each interrupted palindrome is the distance from the respective transcription start site .
methionine auxotrophy , vitamin - B12 supplementation allows slow - growth via the alternate MetH transmethylase , implying that homocysteine is produced by the nonfolate branch at levels high enough to sustain slow - growth ( 30 ) .
Although the Si nuclease mapping results suggest that homocysteine and the MetR protein control metA - lacZ gene expression at the level of transcription , we are not certain why there is not a better correlation between the levels of mRNA and the levels of 3 - galactosidase .
For lysogen 719XAlac , the addition of homocysteine resulted in about a 4 - fold decrease in metA - lacZ mRNA ( Fig. 5 ; compare lanes 1 and 2 ) and about a 2.4 - fold decrease in 3 - galactosidase levels ( Table 3 ) .
For lysogen 761XAlac , grown either with or without homocysteine , there was a 9 - to 10 - fold decrease in metA - lacZ mRNA ( Fig. 5 ; compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and 4 ) , and about a 3.1 - fold decrease in P - galactosidase levels ( Table 4 ) .
It is possible that metA is also regulated posttranscriptionally .
We are constructing appropriate metA - lacZ transcriptional - fusions to test this possibility .
A gel mobility - shift assay showed that the MetR protein binds to a DNA fragment carrying the metA control region ( Fig. 3 ) .
Homocysteine did not significantly alter the DNAbinding affinity of MetR protein .
Similar results have been found for the S. typhimurium metE and metH genes ( 3 , 28 ) .
By using a DNase I footprinting assay with purified MetR protein , a 26 - bp segment beginning 9 bp upstream from the -35 promoter sequence that is protected from DNase I attack was identified ( Fig. 4 ) .
This 26 - bp region was compared with the DNA sequences of the control regions of the S. typhimurium metE ( 28 ) and metH ( 27 ) genes , which are also activated by MetR .
Within the protected region is an interrupted 8 - bp palindrome showing a match of 7 out of 8 bp with the palindrome found in the metE promoter region and a match of 8 out of 8 bp with the palindrome found in the metH promoter region ( Fig. 6 ) .
The interrupted palindrome is conserved in the E. coli metA sequence ( 16 ) , suggesting that MetR plays a role in regulating the metA gene in this organism as well .
The center of the palindrome for the MetR binding site is located 23 bp upstream from the -35 promoter region of the metA gene .
The analogous distances are 24 bp for the metH gene ( 27 ) and 29 bp for the metE gene ( 28 ) .
It is interesting that homocysteine plays a positive role in metE expression ( 29 ) but an inhibitory role in both metH ( 29 ) and metA expression .
The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the 5 - or 6 - bp difference in spacing between the MetR - binding site and the -35 promoter elements plays a role in the opposite effects of homocysteine on expression of the metE gene and on expression of the genes .
