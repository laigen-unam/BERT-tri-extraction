BMC Microbiology 2012 , 12:111 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/12/111 RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access A previously uncharacterized gene stm0551 plays a repressive role in the regulation of type 1 fimbriae in Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium Ke - Chuan Wang 1 , Yuan - Hsun Hsu 1,2 , Yi - Ning Huang 3 and Kuang - Sheng Yeh 3 * Abstract Background : Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium produces surface - associated fimbriae that facilitate adherence of the bacteria to a variety of cells and tissues .
Type 1 fimbriae with binding specificity to mannose residues are the most commonly found fimbrial type .
In vitro , static - broth culture favors the growth of S. Typhimurium with type 1 fimbriae , whereas non - type 1 fimbriate bacteria are obtained by culture on solid - agar media .
Previous studies demonstrated that the phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae is the result of the interaction and cooperation of the regulatory genes fimZ , fimY , fimW , and fimU within the fim gene cluster .
Genome sequencing revealed a novel gene , stm0551 , located between fimY and fimW that encodes an 11.4 - kDa putative phosphodiesterase specific for the bacterial second messenger cyclic - diguanylate monophosphate ( c - di - GMP ) .
The role of stm0551 in the regulation of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium remains unclear .
Results : A stm0551 - deleted stain constructed by allelic exchange constitutively produced type 1 fimbriae in both static - broth and solid - agar medium conditions .
Quantative RT - PCR revealed that expression of the fimbrial major subunit gene , fimA , and one of the regulatory genes , fimZ , were comparably increased in the stm0551 - deleted strain compared with those of the parental strain when grown on the solid - agar medium , a condition that normally inhibits expression of type 1 fimbriae .
Following transformation with a plasmid possessing the coding sequence of stm0551 , expression of fimA and fimZ decreased in the stm0551 mutant strain in both culture conditions , whereas transformation with the control vector pACYC184 relieved this repression .
A purified STM0551 protein exhibited a phosphodiesterase activity in - vitro while a point mutation in the putative EAL domain , substituting glutamic - acid ( E ) with alanine ( A ) , of STM0551 or a FimY protein abolished this activity .
Conclusions : The finding that the stm0551 gene plays a negative regulatory role in the regulation of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium has not been reported previously .
The possibility that degradation of c - di - GMP is a key step in the regulation of type 1 fimbriae warrants further investigation .

BMC Microbiology 2012 , 12:111 Page 2 of 12 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/12/111 Background Salmonella species are some of the most important food - borne pathogens in the world .
Members of the genus Salmonella are gram - negative , facultative anaerobic rods which are composed of more than 2500 serotypes [ 1 ] .
Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) is an important causative agent for gastroenteritis .
For most bacteria , adhesion to host epithelial cells is the first step in establishing an infection .
Adhesion proteins or hair - like appendages called fimbriae on the outer membranes of bacteria have been implicated in adherence [ 2 ] .
Whole - genome sequencing identified 13 separate fimbrial gene clusters that may have the potential to encode fimbria - associated proteins in S. Typhimurium [ 3 ] .
Among these , type - 1 fimbriae are the most commonly found type in S. Typhimurium , as in other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae [ 4 ] .
In addition to adherence , type 1 fimbriae also contribute to virulence and biofilm formation [ 5 - 7 ] .
Phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium involves the interaction and cooperation of genes in the fim gene cluster .
Briefly , FimA , FimI , FimF , and FimH are structural proteins that are incorporated to assemble a fimbrial shaft structure , while FimC and FimD proteins located in the periplasmic space and on the outer membrane respectively , function to transport and anchor the fimbrial proteins .
FimZ , FimY , FimW , and an arginine transfer RNA fimU , regulate fimbrial production by a complicated network [ 8 - 12 ] .
Studies also demonstrated that a global regulator , leucineresponsive regulatory protein ( Lrp ) , and other genes outside the fim gene cluster also take part in the regulatory expression of type - 1 fimbriae [ 13,14 ] .
Bis - ( 3 ′ -- 5 ′ ) - cyclic dimeric GMP ( c - di - GMP ) is a universal second messenger that controls cell surface - associated characters in bacteria [ 15 ] .
Recent studies revealed the importance of c - di - GMP in regulating many physiological process such as adhesion , biofilm formation , exopolysaccharide synthesis , virulence , and motility [ 16,17 ] .
The cellular c - di - GMP concentration is regulated by diguanylate cyclase ( DGC ) and phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) .
DGC catalyzes the formation of c - di - GMP through a linear intermediate , pppGpG , while PDE degrades it into guanosine monophosphate ( GMP ) .
The most prominent conserved protein domains in the PDE are EAL and HD - GYP [ 17 ] .
An open reading frame named stm0551 , located between fimY and fimW , has not previously been investigated to determine its involvement in type - 1 fimbrial regulation in S. Typhimurium ( Figure 1 ) .
The amino - acid sequence of the STM0551 protein could encode a putative PDE .
Multiple alignments of the EAL domain of STM0551 with other known PDE enzymes demonstrated the preservation of several regions throughout the domain sequence > ( Figure 2 ) .
Since STM 3611 influences curli fimbrial expression in S. Typhimurium , and MrkJ controls type 3 fimbriae production and biofilm formation in Klebsiella pneumoniae [ 18,19 ] , we decided to investigate whether stm0551 encodes a functional PDE that plays a role in type 1 fimbrial expression .
In the present study , a stm0551 mutant was constructed by allelic exchange .
Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of this mutant were analyzed .
Purified STM0551 protein was tested for its putative function as a PDE in - vitro .
A possible role of stm0551 in type 1 fimbrial regulation in S. Typhimurium is discussed .
Results Type 1 fimbrial expression by the S. Typhimurium stm0551 mutant strain The bacterial strains and plasmids used were described in Table 1 , while the primers used was indicated in Table 2 .
The S. Typhimurium stm0551 knockout mutant strain was constructed by a one - step gene inactivation method [ 20 ] .
Primers stm0551 - F and stm0551 - R external to stm0551 amplified a 0.5 - kb DNA fragment from S. Typhimurium LB5010 genomic DNA , while the same primer set generated a 1.3 - kb DNA fragment from genomic DNA of the S. Typhimurium stm0551 mutant strain , indicating a kanamycin cassette inserted into the stm0551 gene .
This DNA fragment was also sequenced to determine its identity .
The confirmed stm0551 mutant strain was then designated S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 .
S. Typhimurium LB5010 mediated yeast agglutination and guinea pig erythrocyte when cultured in static LB broth , whereas agglutination was not detected when cells were collected from LB agar ( Table 3 ) .
In contrast , the S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain mediated agglutination when grown on LB agar .
Nonetheless the degree of agglutination was not as strong as the same strain grown in static LB broth .
Transformation of the pSTM0551 plasmid that contains the coding sequence of stm0551 conferred on S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain the ability to inhibit type 1 fimbrial expression in both culture conditions , while the S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain carrying a plasmid that possessed a stm0551 coding sequence with the glutamic - acid ( E ) at position 49 replaced with an alanine ( A ) , or a pACYC184 cloning vector exhibited the same phenotype as the S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain .
The Figure 3 demonstrated the yeast agglutination tests performed on glass slides .
Electron microscopy S. Typhimurium LB5010 prepared in static LB broth culture demonstrated fimbrial appendages on the outermembrane of the cell ( Figure 4 , panel A ) .
On the contrary , S. Typhimurium LB5010 grown on agar medium did not produce type1 fimbriae ( Figure 4 , panel Wang et al. .

FimZ and FimY are both required to activate fimA .
FimW represses fimA expression and FimW interacts with FimZ physically to consume FimZ , diminishing available FimZ to activate fimA .
Leucine - responsive regulatory protein ( Lrp ) activates fimZ .
fimU activate FimY translation .
The function of stm0551 within the fim regulatory circuit needs further characterization .
The S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain prepared from static broth medium ( Figure 4 , panel C ) or agar ( Figure 4 , panel D ) produced fimbrial structures .
Quantitative RT - PCR analysis Total RNA from LB5010 , Δstm0551 , Δstm0551 ( pSTM0551 ) , and Δstm0551 ( pACYC184 ) strains were prepared and analyzed for the fimbrial subunit gene , fimA , and the regulatory genes , fimZ , fimY , and fimW , by quantitative RT - PCR .
16 S ribosomal ( r ) RNA expression was used as a control .
Individual gene expression profiles were first normalized against the 16 S rRNA gene and then compared to the expression level of fimA , fimZ , fimY , and fimW obtained from agar .
As for the parental LB5010 strain , fimA expression obtained from static LB broth was about 150 - fold higher than the value obtained from LB agar .
The fimA expression of the Δstm0551 strain grown on agar was significantly higher than that of LB5010 grown on agar .
Transformation of Δstm0551 with a plasmid possessing the stm0551 coding sequence repressed fimA expression whether this strain was cultured on agar or in static broth , whereas transformation of the same bacterial strain with the plasmid cloning vector pACYC184 de - repressed fimA expression in both culture conditions ( Figure 5 , panel A ) .
The fimZ expression levels from different strains demonstrated a similar profile to that observed for fimA .
The parental LB5010 strain exhibited significant elevated level of fimZ when grown in broth than on agar .
The fimZ expression of Δstm0551 was higher than that of the parental strain grown on agar .
Transforming Δstm0551 with pSTM0551 repressed fimZ expression on both culture conditions , while transforming Δstm0551 with pACYC184 cloning vector de - repressed fimZ expression , leading to comparable level of expression as seen in the Δstm0551 strain ( Figure 5 , panel B ) .
However , the expression levels of fimY were not significantly different between strains under both growth - conditions ( Figure 5 , panel C ) .
Δstm0551 ( pACYC184 ) had higher fimW expression than Δstm0551 ( pSTM0551 ) did when both strains were culture on agar medium ( Figure 5 , panel D ) .
PDE activity Since the predicted amino - acid sequence of STM0551 suggested that it was related to a family of proteins that exhibit PDE activity , we determined whether STM0551 possessed PDE activity .
The in - vitro PDE activity of the purified STM0551 - His fusion protein was determined using the specific substrate , bis ( pNPP ) .
The purified FimY - His fusion protein was used as a control since FimY amino - acids exhibited no domain related to PDE activity .
STM0551 possesses `` EVL '' conserved residues that may form the putative active site that varies from the consensus `` EAL '' sequence .
We constructed a substitution mutation in which the glutamic - acid ( E ) at position 49 was replaced by alanine ( A ) in the stm0551 allele .
A fusion protein of this construct was prepared with the same procedure described for STM0551 and FimY and was designed as STM0551E49A - His .
The reactions that contained STM0551 exhibited a statistically significant 1.75 - Wang et al. .

This result suggests that STM0551 could function as a PDE .
Discussion The regulatory pathway of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium involves several genes including the fim gene cluster and other genes such as lrp [ 8 - 14 ] .
The Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) and flagellar systems also crosstalk with type 1 fimbriae [ 23 ] .
Several studies have indicated that the mechanism controlling the intracellular c - di - GMP concentration plays a critical role in regulating fimbrial production .
For example , MrkJ , a PDE , regulates type - 3 fimbrial production in Klebsiella pneumoniae [ 19 ] .
Deletion of mrkJ resulted in an increase in type - 3 fimbrial production [ 19 ] .
In Escherichia coli S fimbriae are regulated by a PDE , SfaY [ 24 ] .
Production of CupA fimbriae of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is controlled by both the GGDEF domain in protein , PA1120 , and PvrR that contains an EAL domain [ 25 ] .
The FimK of Klebsiella pneumoniae contains the EAL domain and deletion of fimK conferred hyperpiliation of type 1 fimbriae in this bacterium [ 26 ] .
Our present finding may add one more example to this fimbrial regulation/c - di - GMP concentration circuit .
The stm0551 gene of S. Typhimurium is located within the fim gene cluster but has not previously been investigated .
The predicted amino - acids of STM0551 showed similarity to those of proteins with PDE activity , so it was interesting to further dissect the function of stm0551 in terms of type 1 fimbrial regulation .
The parental strain S. Wang et al. .
A static broth culture favors S. Typhimurium to produce type 1 fimbriae , while nonfimbriae phase bacteria were obtained by growth on solid agar medium [ 27 ] .
A stm0551 knockout mutant strain constructed in the present study enabled it to produce type 1 fimbriae on the solid LB agar medium .
This phenotype was correlated with the RT - PCR result that the mRNA expression of the major fimbrial subunit , fimA , was enhanced on solid - agar culture medium .
These suggested that stm0551 plays a repressive role in type 1 fimbrial regulation perhaps in a similar manner to the role played by FimW in the fim regulatory circuit [ 9 ] .
The expression of fimA of the transformant Δstm0551 ( pSTM0551 ) grown on agar decreased to the same level as that of the parental LB5010 strain grown in the same conditions .
However , this transformant did not exhibit visible yeast agglutination and guinea pig erythrocyte hemagglutination when grown in static broth , nor did this strain exhibit fimA expression , which was unexpected .
One of the reasons could have been the relatively high level of STM0551 production due to presence of the multiple copies of the pSTM0551 recombinant plasmid in these cells .
An excessive STM0551 level in S. Typhimurium could presumably cause a dramatically decreased concentration of c - di - GMP locally , and subsequently interfere with fimA expression .
However , the mechanism by which STM0551 interacts with fimA gene expression remains unclear .
One possibility is that the stm0551 product maintained the local concentration of c - di - GMP at a level such that only a certain amount of c - di - GMP was bound by a hypothetical PilZ domain containing protein .
This low concentration of c - di - GMP - bound , PilZ domain - containing protein was not able to activate fimA gene expression .
Disruption of stm0551 increased the local c - di - GMP concentration and consequently also increased the `` functional '' PilZ domain - containing protein to enhance fimA expression .
The FimY protein of S. Typhimurium could possibly function as such a PilZ domain - containing protein since recently we found that the amino - acid sequence of FimY demonstrated relatedness to those of MrkH of K. pneumoniae and YcgR of the E. coli K - 12 strain ( data not shown ) .
Both MrkH and YcgR were shown to be transcriptional activators with c - di - GMP - binding PilZ domains [ 28,29 ] .
OurhypothesisabouttheroleFimYcorrelateswiththe finding that STM0551 did not affect fimY at the transcriptional level ( Figure 5 , panel C ) .
More detailed study of FimY is necessary to define its role in a possible c - di - GMP regulatory network .
Both FimY and FimZ are required to activate fimA expression in S. Typhimurium [ 8 ] .
FimZ is a DNA binding protein that binds the fimA promoter and activate its expression [ 30 ] .
Our qRT - PCR results demonstrated very similar profiles for both fimA and fimZ Wang et al. .
According to the results reported by Saini et al. , FimY and FimZ independently activate the fimA gene expression , in addition , FimY and FimZ also activated each other 's expression [ 31 ] .
Inactivation of stm0551 could possibly increase the local concentration of c - di - GMP , which results more c - di - GMP bound FimY ( active form ) available to activate fimZ and fimA , and eventually amplifies the fimA expression .
FimW is a repressor for fimA in S. Typhimurium .
FimW may achieve this repressive role by repressing fimY transcription or by protein - protein interaction with FimZ [ 9,31 ] .
In the present study , little information was obtained regarding how stm0551 may interact with fimW .

The mRNA transcript levels were obtained by delta - delta Ct ( ΔΔCt ) method , and the expression levels ( 2 - ΔΔCt ) of the parental LB5010 strain cultured on LB agar were set to 1 fold for each gene tested .
The asterisk indicated that the differences in transcript levels were statistically significantly ( p < 0.05 ) .
within the putative active site was replaced with an alanine residue ; the STM0551E49A mutant protein was unable to cleave bis ( pNPP ) .
In accordance with this result , when the STM0551E49A - containg construct cloned into a pACYC184 vector ( pSTM0551E49A ) was transformed into Δstm0551 , the resulting transformant exhibited the same phenotype as that of Δstm0551 or Δstm0551 possessing pACYC184 cloning vector ( Table 3 ) .
This further suggested that the glutamic - acid at position 49 of STM0551 did play a critical role for phosphodiesterase activity .
Therefore , the in - vivo agglutination phenotype results correlated with the in - vitro phosphodiesterase activity result .
In addition , the purified FimY protein , a positive regulator of type 1 fimbriae , also did not demonstrate such activity .
Our results indicated that STM0551 has PDE activity in - vitro .
Currently , we can only say that stm0551 takes part in the complicated type 1 fimbrial regulatory network and play a repressive role .
We have no direct evidence about whether stm0551 actually modulates the concentration of the c - di - GMP pool in S. Typhimurium to achieve its impact on fim gene regulation .
Although the determination of the intracellular concentration of c - di - GMP of Δstm0551 mutants warrants further investigation , this may be prove to be difficult because the c - di - GMP concentration fluctuates locally , due to the spatial compartmentalization of proteins [ 32 ] .
One example of this phenomenon is that the majority of the c - di - GMP in Acetobacter xylinum is bound by a membrane protein and is released only in response to certain signals [ 33 ] ; therefore we need to take into consideration that the actual and measured concentrations of c - di - GMP might be different .
Besides fimbrial production , it is interesting to investigate whether stm0551 can influence other phenotypes of S. Typhimurium .
We tested the ability of bacteria to form biofilm , swimming and swarming motility , and the ability to bind Congo red ( rdar morphotype ) in the LB5010 and Δstm0551strains , but both strains exhibited the same phenotype [ 34,35 ] ( data not shown ) .

Release of p - nitrophenol was determined at 410 nm .
study has suggested for the first time that stm0551 allele which encodes a PDE , play a regulatory role in the production of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium .
Conclusions The c - di - GMP pathway is used by most bacteria ( but not eukaryotes or Archaea ) to regulate numerous biological processes [ 36 ] .
Several lines of evidence have indicated the concentration of c - di - GMP , balanced by diguanylate cyclase ( DGC ) and phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) , account for the fimbrial regulatory network in some microorganisms .
In S. Typhimurium , it has been demonstrated that production of curli fimbriae was inhibited by a PDE STM3611 [ 18 ] .
However , no other type of fimbrial expression in this microorganism has thus far been shown to be controlled by DGC or PDE .
The present study revealed that a previously uncharacterized stm0551 gene , which could encode a PDE , contributes to the down - regulation of type 1 fimbrial expression in S. Typhimurium .
Our finding may provide valuable information that may help to further elucidate the complicated type 1 fimbrial regulatory circuit in this pathogen .
Methods Bacterial strains , plasmids , and culture media The bacterial strains , plasmids , and primers used in the present study are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 .
The S. Typhimurium strain used was LB5010 , an LT2 derivative [ 21 ] .
This strain produces type 1 fimbriae and has a variable fimbrial phase .
Bacteria were cultured in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth ( Difco/Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) or plated on LB agar .
When required , media were supplemented with antibiotics at the following concentrations : 100 μg/ml ampicillin , 50 μg/ml kanamycin , and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol .
Antibiotics were obtained from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO ) .
To detect gene expression , 1 mM of isopropyl - β-D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) was used ( MDbio , Taipei , Taiwan ) .
Construction of a S. Typhimurium stm0551 mutant A stm0551 mutant was created by one - step gene inactivation method as described previously [ 20 ] .
Briefly , a kanamycin - resistance gene from pKD13 tagged with a flanking sequence of the stm0551 gene was generated by a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) technique .
The designed nucleotide sequence was generated with Pfu polymerase ( Fermentas , St. Leon - Rot , Germany ) on a GeneAmp PCR system 2700 thermal cycler ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) and initially incubated at 94 ° C for 3 min , followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min , 50 °C for 1 min , and 72 °C for 2 min .
Primers used in this approach are listed in Table 3 .
Then , the PCR product was introduced by electroporation into S. enterica serotype Typhimurium LB5010 possessing the pKD46 plasmid which expressed λ Red recombinase [ 20 ] .
All transformants were grown on LB agar containing kanamycin .
The constructed mutants were verified by PCR with primers located in the flanking sequence of the stm0551 gene .

Bacterial cells in static - broth medium were collected by centrifugation , and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1 × phosphatebuffered saline ( PBS ) .
Bacteria from LB agar were scraped with a sterile loop and resuspended in 300 μl of1 × PBS .
Subsequently , 30 μl of a 3 % ( vol/vol ) suspension of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Sigma ) or guinea pig red blood cells in PBS and an equal amount of bacterial cells to be tested were mixed on a glass slide [ 27 ] .
Visible agglutination after gentle agitation indicated a positive reaction for type 1 fimbriae .
The presence of mannose - sensitive yeast cell agglutination or mannose - sensitive guinea pig erythrocyte hemagglutination was determined by mixing the bacterial suspension with PBS containing 3 % ( w/v ) α - methyl - D - mannoside ( Sigma ) .
Electron microscopy The bacterial strains tested were grown in static broth or on solid agar and resuspended in 1 × PBS .
The bacterial cells were then negatively stained with 2 % phosphotungstic acid and observed with a Hitachi H - 600 transmission electron microscope ( Hitachi Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Complementation test Primers used for the complementation test ( stm0551 - F and stm0551 - R ) are listed in Table 2 and were used to amplify genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium LB5010 .
The PCR product that possessed the full coding sequence of stm0551 was cloned into the pACYC184 vector using T4 DNA ligase ( Fermentas ) .
To construct a stm0551 allele with the glutamic - acid at position 49 replaced with an alanine ; stm0551 - F and E49A - TOPO - R were used to amplify the first DNA fragment using Pfu DNA polymerase ( Fermentas ) .
The PCR conditions were : denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 sec , 50 °C for 45 sec and 72 °C for 45 sec .
The second DNA fragment was amplified using E49A - TOPO - F and stm0551 - R with the same procedure described above .
These two DNA fragments were purified by Montage Gel Extraction Kit ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) .
Ligation of these two DNA fragments having two overlapping ends was achieved with stm0551 - F and stm0551 - R primers as follows : denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min , ligation at 50 °C for 45 sec and elongation at 72 ° C for 45 sec , followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 sec. , 50 °C for 45 sec , and 72 °C for 45 sec .
Amplified DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRV and cloned into pACYC184 vector to generate pSTM0551E49A .
The mutated stm0551 allele of this plasmid was sequenced to confirm if the glutamic - acid ( E ) at position 49 was replaced by alanine ( A ) before transforming into the S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain by electroporation .
The pACYC184 cloning vector was also transformed into the S. Typhimurium Δstm0551 strain as a control .
Quantitative RT - PCR analysis Total bacterial RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Subsequently , RNA was treated with RNase - free DNase ( 1 unit/1 μg RNA ) to remove contaminating genomic DNA .
The purified RNA was converted to cDNA using a MMLV reverse transcriptase method in the following steps : First , 100 ng of the total RNA was annealed with 100 nM specific primers by heating to 65 °C for 2 min and then cooled on ice for 1 min .
Next , 1 U of RNasin , 2 μl of 100 mM DTT , 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP and 0.5 μl of200U/μl MMLV High Performance Reverse Transcriptase ( Epicentre , Madison , WI ) were added to each RNA/primer mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h , followed by heating at 85 °C for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme and then chilled on ice for at least 1 min .
The specific cDNA that we prepared was used in the following quantitative real - time PCR analysis .
The components of real - time PCR were prepared by adding 10 ng of each specific cDNA and 1 μl of a 10 mM primer solution to 2 × Maxima SYBR Green / ROX qPCR Master Mix ( Fermentas ) and adjusted with ddH 2 O to a final volume of 20 μl .
Cycling conditions were performed using Roche LightCycler 2.0 system ( Roche Applied Science , Branford , CT ) as follows : 95 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 sec , 50 °C for 30 sec and 72 °C for 15 sec .
Dissociation curves and non - template controls were included to detect any primer dimerization or other artifacts .
The mRNA transcript levels were obtained by the method described by Livak and Schmittgen [ 37 ] .
Fusion protein construction A carboxy terminal 6 × histidine - tagged fusion to STM0551 was constructed by amplifying stm0551 with primers stm0551 - TOPO - F and stm0551 - TOPO - R using genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium LB5010 as the template .
The resulting 316 - bp PCR product was cloned into the pET101/D - TOPO vector ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) giving rise to plasmid pSTM0551 - His .
This recombinant plasmid was sequenced at the adjacent portion of the cloning site to make sure it was in frame before subsequent transformation step .
BL21Star ™ ( DE3 ) One Shot W chemically competent E. coli ( Invitrogen ) cells were transformed with pSTM0551 - His .
Log phase cultures were induced to express STM0551 - His by adding 1 mM IPTG at 37 °C for 4 hr .
The STM0551 - His fusion protein was further purified by ProBond purification kit ( Invitrogen ) using the protocol provided by the manufacturer .
The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent ( Fermentas ) [ 38 ] .
A mutant allele of stm0551 was constructed by site - Wang et al. .
