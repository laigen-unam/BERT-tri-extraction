171 , No. 8 Genetic Regulation of the Tricarboxylate Transport Operon ( tctl ) of Salmonella typhimurium KATHARINA A. WIDENHORN , J JACQUELINE M. SOMERS , AND WILLIAM W. KAY * Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology , University of Victoria , Victoria , British Columbia , Canada V8W 2Y2 Tricarboxylates are transported into Salmonella typhimurium by a binding protein - dependent transport system known as TctI .
Genetically , it comprises three structural genes , tctCBA , as well as a fourth gene of unknown function ( tctD ) , which is transcribed divergently from tctC ( K. A. Widenhorn , J. M. Somers , and W. W. Kay , J. Bacteriol .
Deletions in tctD strongly reduced expression of tctC or of tctC - lacZ - transcriptional - fusions ; however , expression was restored when tctD was present in trans .
Expression of tctD - lacZ - transcriptional - fusions was strongly repressed in the presence of D - glucose but could be alleviated by the addition of cyclic AMP .
Furthermore , transcription of tctD was found not to be autogenously regulated .
Thus , tctD is considered to be regulated by catabolite - repression and encodes a transcriptional activator of tctCBA expression .
From the DNA sequence of tctD , the predicted gene product was hydrophilic and shared distinct homologies with other globally regulated transcriptional activators such as OmpR and NtrC .
Bacterial shock - sensitive transport systems utilize periplasmic binding proteins as essential components of active transport complexes ( 3 , 8 ) .
Such transport systems normally comprise a periplasmic binding protein and three inner membrane proteins , one of which has a nucleotide - binding site and is thought to be involved in energy coupling ( 3 , 10 ) .
In Salmonella typhimurium , TctI is the only one of three resident tricarboxylate transport systems ( 13 ) which deploys a periplasmic binding protein known as C - protein ( 24 ) .
From fine structure genetic mapping ( 23 ) as well as cloning and expression studies ( 28 ) , it was found that the tctI operon comprises a total of four genes .
Two genes ( tctA , tctB ) encoding inner membrane proteins and another ( tctC ) encoding the tricarboxylate - specific periplasmic binding protein ( C - protein ) are transcribed from one DNA strand .
A fourth gene ( tctD ) coding for a soluble or weakly membraneassociated protein is transcribed divergently from tctCBA ( 27 ) .
Therefore , TctI would at first appear to contain the same number of protein components as other binding protein - dependent bacterial transport systems .
However , various mutants in tctD elicited properties of regulatory mutations ( unpublished observations ) .
We therefore undertook to elucidate the function of TctD and demonstrate here its role as a trans - acting transcriptional activator .
The function of TctD , its regulation , and its relationship to other transcriptional regulators are discussed .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains , bacteriophages , and plasmids .
The bacterial strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 1 , and a diagram of constructed plasmids is shown in Fig. 1 .
These constructions are described in detail in the text .
Strains harboring plasmids were grown in the presence of the appropriate antibiotics ( micrograms per milliliter ) : ampicillin , 50 ; kanamycin , 50 ; chloramphenicol , 20 .
For routine growth , cells were grown in Luria - Bertani broth ( LB ) , Davis minimal - medium ( DMM ) ( 23 ) , or minimal - medium containing 0.4 % peptone and 10 mM citrate ( PCM ) .

Institute of Molecular Pathology , 4436 Preparation of Mu dl lysates .
A 10 - ml LB culture of a mini - Mu dl - Mu cdts lysogen ( POI1681Tr [ 5 ] transformed with the appropriate plasmid ) was incubated at 30 째C until the cells reached the early log phase ( A578 = 0.3 ) .
Mu lytic growth was heat induced at 42 째C for 25 min , and the culture was transferred to 37 째C until lysis was complete ( -2 h ) .
Chloroform ( 0.1 ml ) was added , and cell debris was removed by centrifugation ( 10 min , 4,500 x g ) .
Mu lysates were kept on ice no longer than 24 h before use .
Transduction with Mu dl .
An overnight LB culture of the Mu - immune strain MC4100 ( RP4 - 2-Tc : : Mu ) ( 22 ) was harvested and concentrated twofold in 10 mM MgSO4 containing 5 mM CaCI2 .
Samples ( 5 to 500 lI ) of a freshly prepared Mu lysate were each added to 0.1 ml of recipient cells .
Cells and phages were mixed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature .
Samples were spread on LB plates containing the appropriate antibiotics .
3 - Galactosidase assays based on o - nitrophenyl - 3-D - galactopyranoside hydrolysis were performed by the method of Miller ( 16 ) .
3 - Galactosidase activity of growing or stationary - phase cells was measured after the cells had been made permeable with chloroform and 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) .
Enzyme activity is expressed in units also according to Miller ( 16 ) .
Whole - cell lysates were subjected to SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) according to the system of Laemmli as modified by Ames ( 2 ) .
Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R - 250 .
Electrophoretic transfer of proteins from SDS - polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose and development of the blot with affinity - purified polyclonal anti - TctC immunoglobulin G was done by the method of Towbin et al. ( 26 ) , except that 0.05 M Tris hydrochloride ( pH 7.4 ) -0.005 M EDTA - 0.15 M sodium chloride containing 0.5 % Tween 20 was used at all steps after the initial blocking .
DNA cloning and sequencing .
The entire tctl operon was subcloned in both orientations as a 4.5 - kilobase ( kb ) EcoRI - HindlIl fragment derived from pKW101 ( 27 ) into M13 bacteriophages mWB2349 and mWB2341 ( 4 ) .
A sequential series of overlapping deletions was constructed by the method of Dale et al. ( 7 ) .
Deletions were sized by agarose gel electrophoresis .
The DNA of both strands of tctD as well as flanking DNA was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide VOL .

RESULTS Effect of tatD on gene expression from tWtC .
In preliminary experiments , we observed the following discrepancies in TctC synthesis .
When two different plasmids with Tn5 insertions in tctD but with otherwise intact tctCBA genes were introduced into LE392 , both strains produced only traces of TctC as judged from Coomassie brilliant blue - stained or immunostained SDS gels .
However , when the same two tatD : : Tn5 plasmids were introduced into KS1070 ( pGl - 2 ) and transcribed from the phage T7 promoter by T7 RNA polymerase , TctC was synthesized at the usual level ( data not shown ) .
This suggested that ttD affected tctC expression only when transcribed from its own promoter , whereas when independent of bacterial transcription , tctD had no effect on tctC expression .
To investigate these observations further , we constructed two pT7 recombinant plasmids .
In pKW131 , a tctA + B - C ' D - DNA fragment was inserted into pT7 - 6 in an orientation such that tctCBA was transcribed from the T7 promoter , provided that pGP1 - 2 was present and phage RNA polymerase was induced ( Fig. 1 ) .
pKW132 is similar in the orientation of the insert ; however , tctD had been previously deleted from the tctl fragment ( Fig. 1 ) .
Whole - cell lysates were prepared from both strains [ LE392 ( pKW131 ) and LE392 ( pKW132 ) ] after growth in LB or PCM and examined for tc tC expression .
The presence of tctD ( pKW131 ) greatly increased the amount of TctC synthesized as judged from Coomassie brilliant bluestained ( Fig. 2A ) or immunostained ( Fig. 2B ) gels .

( A ) Strain DL291 ( pKW125 : : Mu d1 - 5a ) was pregrown in LB , and samples were inoculated into LB ( U ) , LB containing 0.2 % glucose ( @ ) , or LB containing 0.2 % glucose and 5 mM cAMP ( L ) .

Role of TctD protein in tctD transcription transcription from the tctD promoter was subject to catabolite repression ( Fig. 3A and B ) .
Indeed , when 5 mM cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) was added to LB containing 10 mM glucose , the repressive effect of glucose was largely relieved ( Fig. 3A ) .
Role of TctD in tctD transcription .
In an attempt to determine whether tctD is autogenously regulated , we transformed a strain harboring pKW125 : : Mu dl - Sa ( tctD - lacZ ) with a second compatible plasmid encoding TctD ( pKW135 ; Fig. 1 ) .
The expression of tctD was then observed in both haploid [ DL291 ( pKW125 : : Mu d1 - 5a ) ] and merodiploid [ DL291 ( pKW125 : : Mu dl - Sa , pKW134 ) ] strains .
Transcription of tctb was not influenced by the presence of TctD whether cells had been grown in either LB or PCM ( Table 4 ) .
Thus , autogenous regulation of tctD was ruled out .
DNA sequence analysis of tctD .
The nucleotide sequence of a 1,293 - base - pair DNA fragment encompassing tctD was determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing and is shown with the predicted amino - acid sequence in Fig. 4 .
An open reading frame from nucleotides 155 to 826 encodes a 224 - residue protein with a predicted molecular weight of 25,407 , which is in close agreement with the molecular weight observed for TctD by SDS - PAGE ( 27 ) .

The Shine - Dalgarno sequence and the -10 , -35 , and CRP consensus sequences are shown in boxes .
sible -35 consensus sequence 13 base pairs upstream .
These are shown in boxes in Fig. 4 .
In addition , the two most probable target sequences ( TGTGA ) for the cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) - cAMP interaction site are shown in boxes .
These are directly repeated within 3 base pairs of each other .
Six bases 3 ' to the proximal repeat is a sequence resembling another part of the CRP - binding consensus sequence ( TCA - ATA ) .
A hydrophobicity plot of the deduced amino - acid sequence ( not shown ) did not indicate that TctD was particularly hydrophobic .
Only two 8 - residue stretches ( amino acids 72 to 80 and 155 to 163 ) exhibited significant hydrophobic indices .
In addition , the protein comprised only 45 % hydrophobic residues ( Ala , Phe , Ile , Leu , Met , Val , Trp , and Tyr ) .
When the algorithm developed by Lipman and Pearson ( 15 ) was used to compare the amino - acid sequence of TctD with those in the National Biomedical Research Foundation library , considerable homology between TctD and certain other transcriptional activators such as OmpR and NtrC was immediately apparent ( Table 5 ) .
DISCUSSION Expression of the TctI structural genes tctCBA is strongly dependent on the trans - acting tctD gene product , which presumably binds to the tc tC promoter to activate transcription .
Transcription of tctD is itself positively controlled presumably by the binding of the CRP - cAMP complex to the tctD promoter .
This presumption is strengthened by the 60 120 180 240 300 360 420 480 540 660 720 4440 WIDENHORN ET AL. .

The putative promoter ( -10 and -35 ) consensus sequences ( Fig. 4 ) differ somewhat from other procaryotic consensus sequences suggestive of very weak promoter activity .
The preceding CRP - cAMP interaction site is presumably required to enhance transcription from the weak adjacent promoter .
Tricarboxylate transport in S. typhimurium is known to be repressed by the addition of D - glucose and partially reversed by cAMP ( 12 ) .
In addition , S. typhimurium strains with mutations in either crp ( coding for the CRP protein ) or cya ( coding for adenylate cyclase ) are unable to grow on citrate ( 1 ) .
Furthermore , cpd ( coding for cAMP phosphodiesterase ) mutants which accumulate cAMP ( 1 ) result in higher C - protein ( TctC ) synthesis ( 24 ) .
The regulation of TctI could be simplistically viewed as governed only by catabolite - repression of tctD .
However , we have not excluded the possibility that tctCBA also requires the CRP - cAMP complex to initiate transcription .
No strong evidence for a CRP - cAMP consensus sequence in the region of the tctC promoter could be found ( J. M. Somers and W. W. Kay , unpublished data ) .
As an interesting comparison , transcription of the activator ( malT ) of the maltose regulon requires the CRP - cAMP complex but that of the divergently transcribed structural genes malP and malQ does not ( 6 , 20 ) .
The further finding that tctD - lacZ expression is the same irrespective of the presence or absence of a tctD ' allele indicates that tctD expression is not regulated by its own gene product .
The expression of tctD is therefore similar to that of malT ( 6 ) in that neither of these genes in autoregulated ; they are only sensitive to catabolite - repression .
The role of citrate in the regulation of TctI is unknown even though we routinely add it to growth media .
Citrate is known to induce tricarboxylate transport in S. typhimurium ( 12 ) , but it is unclear at present which of the three tricarboxylate transport systems , TctI , - II , or - III ( 13 ) , is induced by citrate .
Preliminary evidence with tctC - lacZ transcriptional fusions suggests that TctI does not require citrate per se to activate TctD and effect transcription of tctCBA ( K. A. Widenhorn and W. W. Kay , unpublished data ) , as is the case for D - arabinose ( 21 ) and maltotriose ( 20 ) induction of their respective periplasmic transport systems .
It is interesting that TctD shows homology with regulatory proteins that are known to respond to exogenous stimuli ( Table 5 ) .
Such proteins belong to two - component regulatory systems in which a membrane sensor activates a regulatory component to effect transcription from outside the cell ( 19 ) .
The transport of C4 dicarboxylates in Rhizobium species is also an example of such a system ( 18 ) .
If TctD were indeed part of such a system , it would have to interact with a hypothetical membrane sensor to be activated .
In this regard , it has been observed that TctD associates weakly with the cytoplasmic membrane ( 27 ) .
It is also interesting that expression of TctI occurs in Escherichia coli ( 28 ) , which normally lacks a tricarboxylate transport system and therefore woiuld not be expected to express a tricarboxylatespecific sensor protein , although anaerobic ( U. Gauglitz , M.Sc .
thesis , University of Goettingen , Goettingen , Federal Republic of Germany , 1984 ) and cryptic citrate transport systems have been reported ( 9 ; Gauglitz , M.Sc .
TctD also shows homology with ArcA ( previously known as Dye ) , a pleiotropic regulatory protein which under anaerobic conditions represses the synthesis of a wide variety of enzymes associated with aerobic catabolism ( 11 ) .
Transport systems for substrates of aerobic pathways have been suggested as candidates for control by arcA ( 11 ) .
Perhaps TctD is functionally related to globally regulated systems that affect expression of aerobic transport systems for intermediary catabolites .
The TctI system apparently differs in its molecular composition from that of other periplasmic permeases .
The histidine , maltose , branched - chain amino - acid , oligopeptide , ribose , 3 - methylgalactoside , and phosphate transport operons encode a single periplasmic binding protein and three inner membrane proteins ( 3 ) , whereas tctI encodes only C - protein ( TctC ) and two cytoplasmic membrane components ( TctA and - B ) .
The L - arabinose transport operon also encodes only two inner membrane proteins ( AraG and AraH ) , but one of these ( AraH ) shares unmistakable homologies with one of the components of the previously mentioned systems , the ATP - binding component thought to mediate active transport ( 21 ) .
From a homology search through the DNA sequence of TctI ( J. M. Somers and W. W. Kay , unpublished data ) , no similar sequences were apparent .
This suggests that TctI differs from other shock - sensitive systems in its mode of active transport , that a hypothetical ATP - binding protein gene is not in the vicinity of the tctI operon , and/or that this component is shared with another transport system which must also be present in E. coli .
The concept of protein components shared by two transport systems is not unprecedented since some amino - acid transport systems are known to share binding protein components ( 14 , 17 ) .
