175 , No. 18 Regulation of the Salmonella typhimurium metF Gene by the MetR Protein JOHN M. COWAN , MARK L. URBANOWSKI , MICHAL TALMI , AND GEORGE V. STAUFFER * Department of Microbiology , The University of Iowa , Iowa City , Iowa 52242 The metF gene in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is under negative transcriptional control by the MetJ repressor .
Expression of an S. typhimurium metF - lacZ gene fusion is repressed up to 10 - fold by methionine addition to the growth medium in E. coli hosts encoding wild - type MetJ repressor ; this repression is not seen in metJ mutants .
metR mutations which eliminate the MetR activator protein result in two - to threefold - more - severe repression by the MetJ repressor .
In a metJ metR double mutant , however , the level of metF - lacZ expression is the same as in a metj mutant , suggesting that MetR antagonizes MetJ - mediated methionine repression of the metF promoter .
A DNA footprint analysis showed that MetR binds to a DNA fragment carrying the metF promoter and protects two separate regions from DNase I digestion : a 46 - bp region from position -50 to -95 upstream of the transcription initiation site and a 24 - bp region from about position +62 to +85 downstream of the transcription initiation site and within the metF structural gene .
Nucleotide changes in each of the MetR - binding sites away from the consensus sequence disrupt MetR - mediated regulation of the metF - lacZ fusion .
The folate branch of the methionine pathway in Salmonella typhimunum includes the metE , metH , and metF genes .
The metF gene product ( 5,10 - methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ) is involved in the biosynthesis of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate from 5,10 - methylenetetrahydrofolate ( 20 ) .
5 - Methyltetrahydrofolate serves as a substrate for the methylation of homocysteine to form methionine by either the metE or the metH gene product ( 20 ) .
The MetJ repressor negatively regulates the metF gene , as well as all other met biosynthetic genes except metH ( 20 ) .
The MetJ repressor is believed to function as a dimer , binding to the 8 - bp recognition sequence 5 ' - AGACGTCT - 3 ' ( 1 , 19 ) .
Five degenerate forms of this 8 - bp sequence occur as tandem repeats in the metF promoter region ( 24 , 25 ) .
In addition to MetJ - mediated repression , two genes in the folate branch of the methionine pathway , metE and metH , are positively regulated by the metR gene product ( 29 ) .
The MetR protein belongs to the lysR family of bacterial activator proteins ( 9 ) .
DNase - I-protection experiments have shown that MetR binds to the metE metR intergenic promoter region ( 3 , 28 ) and also to the metA ( 15 ) and metH ( 2 ) control regions .
The DNA sequence of the S. typhimunum metF gene has been determined ( 24 ) .
A computer search of the DNA sequence identified two possible MetR - binding sites in the metF promoter region and a third possible binding site in the structural gene ( Fig. 1 ) .
We show here that the MetR protein is involved in metF regulation and that all three putative MetR - binding sites are required for MetR - mediated regulation of the metF gene .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains , plasmids , and phages .
All bacterial strains used in this study were derived from Escherichia coli K - 12 and are described in Table 1 .
Plasmid pMC1403 ( 4 ) , a lac fusion * 5862 vector , has been described previously , as have bacteriophages M13mpl8 ( 30 ) and Xgt2 ( 18 ) .
Plasmid pGS174 carries the S. typhimurium metF gene ( 24 ) , and pFlac carries a fusion of the S. typhimunum metF control region and the first 12 amino - acid codons of the structural gene to the eighth codon of lacZ ( 25 ) .
Luria agar , Luria broth , and glucose minimal - medium ( GM ) have been described previously ( 23 ) .
Supplements were added at the following concentrations : amino - acids , 50 , ug/ml ; vitamin - B1 , 1 , ug/ml ; ampicillin , 150 pug/ml ; and 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - P-Dgalactopyranoside ( X - Gal ) , 40 , ug/ml .
, B - Galactosidase activity was assayed as described by Miller ( 17 ) , using the chloroform - sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis procedure .
Results are the averages of two or more assays in which each sample was measured in triplicate .
Restriction enzyme digestions , ligations , plasmid and phage DNA isolations , and DNA fragment isolations were done as described by Maniatis et al. ( 14 ) .
Transformations were done by using polyethylene glycol - and dimethyl sulfoxide - prepared competent cells ( 5 ) .
A 746 - bp EcoRI - BamHI fragment carrying the metF control region was isolated from plasmid pFlac ( 25 ) and was cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of phage M13mpl8 , creating phage M13mpl8 - Flac .
Point mutations were introduced into the metF control region by the oligonucleotide - directed mutagenesis procedure of Kunkle ( 12 ) as modified by Byerly et al. ( 2 ) .
Changes were made that were shown previously to prevent MetR binding to the metH control region ( 2 ) .
The mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis , and then the EcoRI - BamHI fragments carrying the desired mutations were recloned into plasmid pMC1403 , creating mutant derivatives of the original pFlac fusion plasmid .
Each mutant metF - lacZ fusion and the lacY and lacA genes were cloned onto bacteriophage Xgt2 , and appropriate strains were lysogenized with the metF - lacZ fusion phage AFlac or mutant derivatives , as previously described ( 26 ) .

An 8 - pl portion of a solution of DNase I ( 2.5 , ug/ml disolved in 20 mM sodium acetate [ pH 7 ] plus - 32 mM CaCl2 ) was added , and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 30 s.

RESULTS MetR - binding site analysis .
A computer search of the S. typhimurium metF sequence using the MetR - binding consensus sequence 5 ' - TGAANNT/ANNITCA -3 ' ( 27 , 28 ) identified three possible MetR - binding sites ( Fig. 1 ) .
Two are centered 80 and 60 bp upstream from the +1 transcription initiation site , and the third is centered 77 bp downstream of the +1 transcription initiation site .
To determine whether the MetR protein binds to the metF control region , we used a gel mobility - shift assay .
A 467 - bp BstEII - Hinfl DNA fragment carrying the metF control region was isolated from plasmid pGS174 , 32p labeled at the Hinfl end , and used in the gel mobility - shift assay ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The labeled DNA fragment was shifted to three positions of slower mobility as the MetR concentration was increased from 0.25 to 1 , ug/ml ( Fig. 2 ) .
The same concentrations of MetR did not shift a control fragment that did not contain a MetR - binding site ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that all three MetR - binding sites identified by the computer search might bind the MetR protein .
A DNase - I-protection assay was used to show where the MetR protein specifically binds in the metF control region ( see Materials and Methods ) .

It should be noted that the DNase I control lane ( lane 3 ) in Fig. 3 is overloaded .
This is especially apparent for the shorter run to optimize site 3 in the autoradiogram .
However , since lanes 4 and 5 ( 0.25 and 0.5 , ug/ml , respectively ) look identical for both sites 2 and 3 , the results show that MetR protects these sites only at higher concentrations of MetR ( 1 and 2 , ug/ml ) .
Regulation of the metF - lacZ fusion .
A metF - lacZ gene fusion constructed previously ( 25 ) and carried on phage Xgt2 ( designated AFlac ) was used to reexamine the effect of MetR on the regulation of the metF gene .
This phage was used to lysogenize appropriate strains , the lysogens were grown in GM supplemented with either D - methionine ( derepressing condition ) or L - methionine ( repressing condition ) , and , B - galactosidase levels were measured .
D - Methionine is converted to L - methionine by the cell and serves as a growth rate - limiting source of methionine ( 8 ) .
In the metR mutant strain GS244 , expression of the metF - lacZ fusion with D - methionine was reduced twofold compared with that in the metE control strain GS243 ( Table 2 ) .
With L - methionine , however , metF - lacZ expression in the metR mutant was reduced 2.7 - fold compared with that in the metE control strain .
These results suggest that the role of MetR becomes more important as MetJ - mediated repression is increased .
This hypothesis would predict that in a metJ mutant , in which all MetJ - mediated repression is abolished , MetR would have no function in metF - lacZ expression .
To test this hypothesis , strains GS597 ( metl ) and GS748 ( metJ metR ) were lysogenized with XFlac , the lysogens were grown in GM supplemented with D - methionine or L - methionine , and 1 - galactosidase levels were measured .
In lysogen 748XFlac , the level of metF - lacZ expression was essentially the same as in lysogen 597AFlac under both growth - conditions ( Table 2 ) .
Effects of MetR - binding site mutations on metF - lacZ expression .
Mutations that changed each of the three MetR - binding sites individually away from the MetR consensus binding sequence were introduced into the metF control region ( see Materials and Methods and Fig. 1 ) .
Two base pairs were changed in site 1 , since it has a higher affinity for MetR than sites 2 and 3 ( Fig. 3 ) .
The mutated metF - lacZ - fusions were subcloned into phage Xgt2 , and the phage was used to lysogenize strains GS748 ( metJ metR ) , GS243 ( metE ) , and GS244 ( metR ) .
The lysogens were grown in GM supplemented with D - methionine or L - methionine , and 13 - galactosidase levels were determined .
In strain GS243 ( metE ) , the mutant AFlac lysogens had about twofold - lower 1 - galactosidase levels than the wild - type XFlac lysogen when grown in the presence of D - methionine ( derepressing condition ) and about threefold - lower 1 - galactosidase levels than the wildtype lysogen when grown in the presence of L - methionine VOL .

The growth medium was GM plus phenylalanine , vitamin - B1 , and either D - methionine or L - methionine .
In strain GS244 ( metR ) , the mutant and wild - type XFlac lysogens had essentially the same 3 - galactosidase levels when grown under the derepressing condition .
The addition of L - methionine further repressed metF - lacZ expression , and the , B - galactosidase levels were essentially the same in the wild - type and mutant XFlac lysogens .
In strain GS748 ( metJmetR ) , the mutant and wild - type AFlac phage had essentially the same P - galactosidase levels under both growth - conditions ( Table 3 ) .
These results suggest that the mutations are specifically affecting a MetR - dependent mechanism and that all three MetR - binding sites identified by DNase I footprinting are necessary for normal metF - lacZ expression .
DISCUSSION A computer search of the S. typhimurium metF sequence identified three possible MetR - binding sites ( Fig. 1 ) .
In vitro binding assays and DNase - I-protection experiments verified that MetR binds to metF promoter DNA and protects two separate regions from DNase I attack ( Fig. 1 ) : ( i ) a ca. 46 - bp region from position -50 to -95 upstream from the transcription initiation site and encompassing two of the predicted MetR - binding sites ( sites 1 and 2 ) in the metF promoter region and ( ii ) a ca. 24 - bp region from approximately position +62 to +85 downstream from the transcriptional initiation site and encompassing the third predicted MetRbinding site located in the metF structural gene ( site 3 ) .
It should be noted that sites 2 and 3 required higher concentrations of the MetR protein than did site 1 for protection from DNase I digestion , suggesting that they have a lower affinity for MetR protein .
Results from previous work suggested that MetR has only a minor effect on metF - lacZ expression .
, B - Galactosidase levels from a metF - lacZ gene fusion were only two - to threefold lower in a metR mutant than in the wild - type strain ( 29 ) .
In addition , a metR mutation could be complemented by a multicopy plasmid carrying either a metE or metH gene ; presumably the residual expression of either gene from multicopy plasmids in the metR mutant is sufficient for growth .
Since the transformants did not require a multicopy plasmid carrying metF , the results suggest that metF expression is sufficient in the metR mutant to support growth .
MetR - MEDIATED REGULATION OF metF 5865 Subsequent studies to determine whether the smaller effect on metF expression is due to a direct or indirect effect of the MetR protein were not done .
We reexamined the effect of MetR protein on metF - lacZ expression in light of the in - vitro binding assays and the DNase - I-protection experiment .
In the metR mutant strain GS244 grown under methionine - repressing conditions , metF - lacZ expression was reduced 2.7 - fold compared with that in the metR + control strain GS243 ( Table 2 ) .
However , at intermediate levels of methionine repression ( D - methionine ) , metF - lacZ expression in the metR mutant was reduced only twofold compared with that in the metR + control strain .
Under completely nonrepressing conditions ( metJ mutants ) , there was essentially no difference between the metR strain GS748 and the metR + control strain GS597 .
These results suggest that MetR is required for activation of metF - lacZ only under MetJ - mediated repressing conditions .
Superrepression by MetJ in a metR mutant is also seen for metE - lacZ expression ( 29 ) .
However , in the absence of MetJ - mediated repression , metE - lacZ is still regulated over a 100 - fold range by MetR ( 28 ) .
These results and those described above suggest that MetR could function by two different mechanisms for metE - lacZ and metF - lacZ expression : as an activator and as an antirepressor , respectively .
The mechanism of MetJ - mediated repression of the metF gene is not known .
If repression involves steric hinderance of RNA polymerase , then MetR alone or a MetR - RNA polymerase complex could act as an antirepressor to destabilize MetJ binding .
As shown in Fig. 1 , the MetR - and MetJ - binding sites do not overlap .
However , MetR bound at MetR - binding sites 1 and 2 in the promoter region could interact directly with MetR bound at site 3 in the structural gene , possibly forming a DNA loop ( 10 , 11 , 13 ) that could antagonize repressor function .
Mutations introduced by sitedirected mutagenisis into each of the MetR - binding sites away from the consensus MetR - binding sequence completely disrupted MetR - mediated regulation ( Fig. 1 and Table 3 ) .
Alternatively , MetR could function as an activator for metF .
The repressor may interfere with RNA polymerase binding , open complex formation , or promoter clearance at the metF promoter ; MetR could partially compensate by affecting any of these parameters .
In this model , then , differences in the architectures of the nonrepressed promoters may account for the observation that the metE promoter is intrinsically weak and thus always requires activation for full expression ( 28 ) , whereas metF requires activation only under repressing conditions .
This model also presumes that the step blocked by MetJ is not rate limiting in the absence of the repressor , since metF - lacZ expression in the metJ metR double mutant is only slightly reduced compared with that in the metJ mutant ( Table 2 ) .
