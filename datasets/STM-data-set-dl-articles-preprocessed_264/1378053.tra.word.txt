174 , No. 13 Regulation of Plasmid Virulence Gene Expression in Salmonella dublin Involves an Unusual Operon Structure MARTIN KRAUSE , lt * FERRIC C. FANG ,1 AND DONALD G. GUINEY1 ' 2 Division of Infectious Diseases 8416 , Department of Medicine , UCSD Medical Center , San Diego , California 92103 , 1 and Center for Molecular Genetics , University of California , San Diego , La Jolla , California 920932 The 80 - kb plasmid pSDL2 of SalmoneUla dublin Lane is essential for lethal systemic infection in experimental mice .
A cluster of five plasmid genes , designated spvR , spvA , spvB , spvC , and spvD , is sufficient to express the plasmid - related virulent phenotype .
The spvR gene product has recently been identified as a positive regulator of spvB expression in the stationary - phase of bacterial growth ( F. C. Fang , M. Krause , C. Roudier , J. Fierer , and D. G. Guiney , J. Bacteriol .
In this study , we evaluated the role of SpvR in the transcription of the downstream virulence genes spvABCD .
Analysis of mRNA synthesis revealed that SpvR promotes transcription of the downstream spvABCD genes in the stationary growth phase .
Transcript mapping of the spv region demonstrated an unusual operon structure involving messages for spvA , spvAB , spvABC , and spvABCD .
Quantitative measurement of transcription and of gene expression by use of translational spv - lacZ fusions suggested that SpvA , SpvB , SpvC , and SpvD are produced in decreasing abundance .
Primer extension assays identified two transcriptional start sites - 70 and 98 bp upstream of the start codon of spvA , but none upstream of spvB , spvC , or spvD .
Deletion of a 320 - bp EcoRI - ApaI segment that contains both start sites abolished expression of the downstream spvB and spvC genes .
Our results establish a central function of SpvR as a positive regulator of the downstream spvABCD genes in the stationary - phase of bacterial growth and indicate that the primary mechanism of regulation is by activation of promoters upstream of spvA .
Nontyphoid Salmonella serovars are enteric pathogens responsible for a variety of clinical syndromes , ranging from localized gastroenteritis to septicemia and systemic disease .
Salmonella dublin is an unusually invasive serotype that is host - adapted to cattle , constituting a major veterinary problem worldwide .
In humans , infection is acquired by drinking unpasteurized milk or by ingestion of raw calf liver extracts and frequently results in bacteremia with metastatic suppurative infections at extraintestinal sites ( 7 ) .
In experimental mice , S. dublin causes septicemia without concomitant diarrhea and uniformly leads to death .
Along with other Salmonella serovars , such as S. typhimurium , S. choleraesuis , S. enteritidis , S. gallinarum , and S. pullorum , S. dublin harbors a large plasmid that is required for virulence ( 1 , 11 , 15 - 17 , 41 ) .
In mice infected by either the oral or intraperitoneal route of inoculation , the plasmid promotes bacterial survival and proliferation in the reticuloendothelial tissues of the liver and spleen ( 14 ) .
Our laboratory has been studying the 80 - kb plasmid pSDL2 from S. dublin Lane , a strain that was originally isolated from a patient with bacteremia ( 5 ) .
A cluster of five genes contained in an 8.2 - kb SalI - XhoI segment was shown to be required to confer lethal disease in BALB/c mice ( 2 , 21 , 44 ) .
The complete nucleotide sequence of this region was determined and showed that the genes are all oriented in the same direction ( 21 ) .
Comparison of the DNA sequence of the S. dublin virulence region with corresponding plasmid sequences from S. typhimurium and S. choleraesuis indicates that these genes are closely related alleles , with very few amino - acid differences .
Additional homology studies indicate that this region is also highly conserved among the other * t Present address : Medizinische Klinik Universitatsspital Zurich , Ramistrasse 100 , CH - 8091 Zurich , Switzerland .
4482 Salmonella serovars that harbor virulence plasmids ( 9 , 35 , 43 ) .
In several instances , functional conservation has also been demonstrated by replacement of the virulence plasmid in one serovar with the plasmid from a different serovar ( 1 , 2 ) .
Because of these similarities , a universal genetic nomenclature for the five genes has been adopted which designates the loci as Salmonella plasmid virulence ( spv ) genes and recognizes that they are closely related alleles that are present in several serovars ( 12 ) .
The genes are given the designations spvR , spvA , spvB , spvC , and spvD , and the correlation between this nomenclature and previous names is summarized in Table 1 .
The spvR gene product was found to have substantial amino - terminal homology with a large family of bacterial transcriptional activator proteins , including MetR , OxyR , LysR , CysB , and other proteins , at least some of which are involved in amino - acid metabolic pathways ( 21 , 34 ) .
The spvABCD genes , however , revealed no significant homology with other known genes and appear to encode peptides unique to the Salmonella genus ( 10 , 21 ) .
Presently , the functions of these genes and the mechanisms by which their products interact with the host tissue at the molecular level are unknown .
The recent finding that spvB is expressed selectively in the stationary growth phase has led to the hypothesis that starvation - induced bacterial growth limitation within the phagosomes of host phagocytes may be the environmental signal for plasmid - mediated virulence gene expression ( 8 ) .
None of the proteins seems to be secreted into the extracellular compartment ; however , when overexpressed , SpvA was detected in the outer membranes , and SpvB and SpvC were found in the cytosolic as well as the particulate fraction of the cells ( 36 , 42 ) .
Little is known about the regulation and transcriptional organization of the spv genes .
Recently , Fang et al. ( 8 ) , Caldwell and Gulig ( 4 ) , and Matsui et al. ( 25 ) have independently shown that the spvR gene product regulates expres - VOL .

These observations appear to contradict the report of Williamson et al. , which suggested that spvA regulates the expression of spvR ( 45 ) .
Taira et al. have found that spvA and spvB are expressed as a unit ; however , conclusive evidence demonstrating the presence of an spv operon is still lacking ( 37 , 40 ) .
The head - to - tail orientation of the spvA , spvB , spvC , and spvD genes suggests a polycistronic transcription of the region , although the intergenic sequences of 180 to 280 nucleotides between the genes are unusually long for a classical bacterial operon ( 21 , 30 ) .
In this study , we demonstrate that spvR plays a central regulatory role for the entire spv region by acting as a transcriptional activator of the downstream spvABCD genes in the stationary growth phase .
Transcription initiation in a region upstream of spvA results in multiple mRNA species of increasing length which include spvA , spvAB , spvABC , and spvABCD transcripts .
We propose that the positive regulation exerted by spvR is mediated by activation of promoters upstream of spvA that results in the transcription of monoand polycistronic messages .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and culture conditions .
S. dublin Lane is a clinical blood isolate that contains the virulence plasmid pSDL2 .
S. dublin LD842 is the pSDL2 - cured avirulent derivative of S. dublin Lane ( 5 ) .
Eschenichia coli DH5a [ F - 480d lacZAM15 A ( lacZYA - argF ) U169 recAl endAl hsdR17 supE44 X - thi - 1 gyrA relA ] was used as the host for cloning and plasmid constructions ( 13 ) .
To move new constructs into S. dublin LD842 , plasmids were first passed through restriction - deficient S. typhimurium LB5000 before introduction into S. dublin LD842 ( 3 , 19 ) .
To culture bacteria in the stationary - phase , organisms were grown for at least 20 h at 37 Â°C with vigorous shaking ( 250 to 300 rpm ) .
Antibiotics were added to Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth or agar to the following final concentrations : penicillin , 400 , ug/ml ; kanamycin , 50 , ug/ml ; and chloramphenicol , 20 , ug/ml .
The 80 - kb wild - type virulence plasmid pSDL2 has been described in detail earlier ( 2 ) .
pSD15 - 2 is an avirulent derivative of pSDL2 that contains a TnS - oniT insertion within the spvR virulence gene ( 2 , 21 ) .
pUD5 contains spvR within a 2.4 - kb SalI - EcoRI fragment cloned into a low - copy - number RK2 derivative ( 21 ) and was used to complement the spvR mutation in pSD15 - 2 .
pFF18 contains the same 2.4 - kb SalI - EcoRI fragment in pUC19 ( 8 ) .
pUD8 was constructed to provide spvA in trans by ligating an 866 - bp PstI fragment into pUC18 under the control of the lac promoter .
The recently described pFF14 , which contains spvR , spvA , and an spvB - lacZ fusion on a piSA replicon , was used to construct pFF14 - 1 , pFF14 - 2 , pSpvA - Z , pSpvC - Z , and pSpvD - Z ( 8 ) .
The constructions of these plasmids are outlined in Fig. 1 .
pFF14 - 1 is almost identical to pFF14 but lacks the upstream sequences and start region of spvA .
To obtain pFF14 - 1 , pFF14 was partially digested with EcoRI andApaI , treated with Klenow fragment , and recircularized .
Plasmids were screened by clone analysis for deletion of the 320 - bp EcoRI - ApaI fragment .
pFF14 - 2 differs from pFF14 by the lack of spvA ; pFF14 was cut with PstI and religated , and deletion of the 866 - bp PstI fragment was confirmed by clone analysis .

Construction of spv - lacZ - fusions and derivatives .
The map of the virulence region containing the five spv genes ( R , A , B , C , and D ) is shown at the top .
pFF14 was used to construct pFF14 - 1 , pFF14 - 2 , pSpvA - Z , pSpvC - Z , and pSpvD - Z ( 8 ) ; the strategies for their constructions are marked with 1 ( pFF14 - 1 ) , 2 ( pFF14 - 2 ) , 3 ( pSpvA - Z ) , 4 ( pSpvC - Z ) , and 5 ( pSpvD - Z ) .

4484 KRAUSE ET AL. blunt ended with Klenow fragment , and reannealed .
Plasmids were screened by clone analysis for deletion of the 1.2 - kb NcoI - BamHI segment .
pSpvC - Z and pSpvD - Z contain translational spvC - lacZ and spvD - lacZ - fusions , respectively , with conservation of the upstream sequences , including spvR .
To obtain pSpvC - Z , the KpnI - StuI fragment that contained the second half of spvB and the first 16 bp of spvC was inserted into KpnI - and BamHI - digested pFF14 ( Fig. 1 ) .
A small SmaI - BamHI adapter sequence from the multiple cloning region of pUC19 was used to anneal the StuI end to the BamHI site of lacZ .
Nucleotide sequencing confirmed the presence of an in - frame fusion .
To construct pSpvD - Z , the 2.5 - kb KpnI - BstBI fragment containing the second half of spvB , all of spvC , and the first part of spvD was inserted into KpnI - and BamHI - digested pFF14 .
A ClaI - BamHI adapter sequence from pBluescript KS ' connected the BstBI site and the BamHI site of lacZ .
pSpvA - ZmutR and pSpvC - Zm , uR are identical to pSpvA - Z and pSpvC - Z , respectively , except for the presence of a multiple reading frame termination linker at the HpaI site in spvR .
These two constructs were obtained by exchange of the 1.5 - kb NsiI - ApaI fragment from pSpvA - Z and pSpvC - Z with the corresponding NsiI - ApaI segment of pFF26 ( 8 ) .
pSpvC - Z-1 is a derivative of pSpvC - Z that lacks the 320 - bp EcoRI - ApaI segment from the upstream region of spvA .
It was constructed by exchange of the 3.4 - kb NsiI - KpnI fragment from pSpvC - Z with the 3.1 - kb NsiI - IpnI fragment of pFF14 - 1 .
Maps of all the new constructs are shown in Fig. 1 .
CsCl - purified plasmid DNA was prepared by the cleared - lysate procedure .
Rapid plasmid clone analysis , cleavage with restriction endonucleases , gel purification , random priming of DNA fragments with [ a - 32P ] dCTP , 5 ' - terminus labeling of oligonucleotides with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [ y - 3 P ] ATP , ligations , and transformations were performed by standard methods ( 24 ) .
Measurement of 1 - galactosidase activity .
The standard procedure described by Miller was used for quantitative measurement of ( 3 - galactosidase activity ( 29 ) .
Briefly , 100 , u of cells with a known optical density at 600 nm ( OD6w ) were resuspended in 0.9 ml of phosphate buffer , lysed with 10 of 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) and 20 pI of chloroform , and equilibrated at 28 Â°C .
Then , 200 pI of ONPG ( o - nitrophenyl - , - D - galactopyranoside ; 4 mg/ml ) was added each minute until the mixture turned yellow .
The OD420 and OD550 of the reaction mix , the reaction duration ( in minutes ) , and the OD6 .
of the bacterial culture were used to calculate the corrected 3 - galactosidase activity units .
Each assay was repeated at least two times .
RNA isolation and Northern ( RNA ) blotting .
Pellets of cultures grown to different OD6 .
values in LB were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.02 M sodium acetate - 1 mM EDTA ( pH 5.3 ) .
Then 1 ml of 0.02 M sodium acetate - 1 mM EDTA ( pH 5.3 ) -1 % SDS was added , and the solution was immediately transferred to 5 ml of phenol saturated with water and equilibrated at 65 Â°C .
The solutions were mixed for 5 min at 65 Â°C , and the aqueous phase was reextracted with phenol twice ( 22 ) .
The aqueous phase was then layered on a 3 - ml 9.5 M CsCl cushion and centrifuged in a horizontal rotor at 40,000 rpm for 12 h .
After careful removal of the supernatant , the pellet was washed with 70 % ethanol , dried , and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate - treated water .
RNA integrity was determined by the presence of discrete rRNA bands after electrophoresis , and RNA concentration was determined by measuring the A2 .
RNA samples ( 10 to 20 , g ) were electrophoresed on horizontal denaturing formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes ( Oncor , Gaithersburg , Md. ) .
Probes were labeled by random priming with [ a - 32P ] dCTP or by the kinase reaction with [ , y - 32PJATP .
Hybridization was performed overnight at 45 Â°C in the presence of 50 % formamide .
The membranes were washed three times for 1 h each at room temperature and once for 1 h at 550C with O. 1x SSC - 0.1 % SDS ( lx SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate ) .
Oligonucleotides complementary to the noncoding strand 24 to 36 bp downstream of the initiation codon of spvA , spvB , spvC , and spvD were used as primers for each individual spv gene ( spvA , 5 ` ACCTGTG AAAGTGCCGG3 ' ; spvB , 5 ` ATCAGCGCTAAAGTGGC3 ' ; spvC , 5 ` TACAATATTCAAAGGAGGG3 ' ; spvD , 5 ` ATCTT GGGATGACGCAC3 ' ) .
They were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer .
[ - y - 32P ] ATP - labeled primer ( 0.1 pmol ) was annealed with 50 , ug of total RNA by heating the mixture to 100 Â°C for 5 min and allowing the temperature to drop gradually to 42 Â°C .
Then , 1/10 volume of lOx AMV buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8.3 ] , 500 mM KCI , 100 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol ) , 0.1 mM ( final concentration ) of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate , and 10 U of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Boehringer ) were added .
After incubation at 42 Â°C for 30 min , 1 , ug of RNase A per ml was added .
Finally , 7 RI of formaldehyde stop buffer was added , and the samples were electrophoresed on 6 % polyacrylamide sequencing gels ( 22 ) .
Transcription and expression of spvA , spvC , and spvD are growth phase dependent .
In order to determine whether the expression of spvA , spvC , and spvD is regulated by growth , analogous to spvB , we constructed translational spv - lacZ fusions which were derived from pFF14 ( 8 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
Plasmids pSpvA - Z , pSpvC - Z , and pSpvD - Z were introduced into S. dublin LD842 , and P - galactosidase activity was plotted versus the optical density of cell cultures grown in LB .
In a manner analogous to expression of spvB , expression of spvA , spvC , and spvD increased with higher optical densities ( Fig. 2 ) .
Significant quantitative differences in expression were seen among the four lacZ fusion proteins , SpvA being the most abundant , followed by SpvB , SpvC , and SpvD .
Likewise , the increase in spvA expression occurred earliest in the growth cycle , followed by spvB , spvC , and spvD .
This expression pattern was confirmed at the transcriptional level by Northern blot hybridization .
Equivalent amounts of total RNA isolated from S. dublin Lane ( containing the wild - type plasmid pSDL2 ) at different phases of cell growth were electrophoresed ( 1.2 M formaldehyde , 1.0 % agarose ) , transferred to nylon membranes , and probed with specific spvA , spvC , and spvD probes .
Transcription of spvA was detectable in the late log phase , and with increasing optical density , the intensity and number of bands increased substantially ( Fig. 3 ) .
Transcription of spvC and spvD was not detectable until the cultures reached the late stationary growth phase ( Fig. 3 ) .
Transcription signals were most intense for spvA , followed by spvC and spvD .
These results , together with the recently published data on spvB , indicate that all four spvABCD genes are transcribed progressively and expressed during the growth cycle , reaching maximal expression in the late stationary - phase .
Polycistronic messages are transcribed from the spv region of the native pSDL2 plasmid .
The presence of multiple mRNA species in the Northern blot assays indicated a complex transcriptional organization of the spv region .

Expression of the spv genes in relation to bacterial growth phase .
A 20 - , ul amount of an overnight culture of S. dublin LD842 harboring pSpvA - Z , pSpvC - Z , or pSpvD - Z was grown simultaneously in 10 ml of LB to increasing cell densities .
The spvB - lacZ fusion plasmid ( pFF14 ) served as a positive control .
At different phases of cell growth , p - galactosidase activity was determined and plotted against OD6w .
The measurements were repeated twice , and curves from a representative experiment are shown .
The expression of all spv genes increases in the stationary - phase of growth .
define the origin and length of the different transcripts , RNA extracted from a late - stationary - phase culture of S. dublin Lane was mapped with multiple radioactively labeled DNA probes ( Fig. 4 ) .
To obtain good separation of all mRNA bands on agarose gel electrophoresis , different conditions than those used in the previous section were employed ( 4 M formaldehyde , 1.4 % agarose ) .
Standard mRNA markers and the internal rRNA bands were used for estimating the mRNA sizes ( rRNA bands saturate the binding sites on the nylon membrane at 1,542 and 2,904 nucleotides and create `` white shadows '' in the mRNA pattern ) .
The spvA probes Al , A3 , and A4 revealed four major bands of 0.9 , 3.0 , 4.0 , and 4.8 kb ( Fig. 4 ) .
However , the end - labeled A2 probe ( 202 - bp EcoRI - PstI fragment ) failed to hybridize , suggesting that the 5 ' ends of all four mRNAs were located in the same segment in the region upstream of the spvA start codon .
From the length of the mRNAs , it was extrapolated that the messages represented spvA , spvAB , spvABC , and spvABCD mRNAs , respectively ( Fig. 4 ) .
The B , C , and D probes confirmed the predicted lengths of the different messages .
The Bi and B2 probes revealed identical 3.0 - , 4.0 - , and 4.8 - kb bands , the Cl and C2 probes revealed the 4.0 - and 4.8 - kb bands , and the Dl and D2 probes revealed the 4.8 - kb band ( Fig. 4 ) .
Weak bands running just ahead of the 1,541 - and 2,904 - bp rRNAs seen with the A and B probes ( also seen with the C and D probes after longer radiographic exposure and shown in Fig. 3 ) are most likely artifacts due to abundant rRNA , which condenses the degraded mRNA smear , causing the appearance of extra bands ( 30 ) .
A faint 3.0 - kb band was consistently observed with the C probes ( Fig. 4 ) .
Since this band was not seen with the D probes , it is possible that it represents an spvBC transcript that migrates at the same speed as the 3.0 - kb spvAB transcript on gel electrophoresis .
The relative amounts of the mRNA species were determined by densitometric scans of the autoradiogram in lane 1 of Fig. 4 .
Integration of the peaks gave an A/AB/ABC / ABCD spvA spvC spvD FIG. 3 .
Northern blots with spvA , spvC , and spvD probes at different stages of the bacterial growth cycle .
Equal amounts of total RNA from S. dublin Lane at different ODwo values ( 0.3 , 0.7 , 1.2 , 1.6 , and 2.0 ) were probed with a specific spvA probe ( 866 - bp PstI - PstI fragment ) , a specific spvC probe ( 621 - bp DraI - DraI fragment ) , and a specific spvD probe ( 446 - bp SspI - SspI fragment ) .
The rRNA bands are indicated as size markers ( in nucleotides ) .
Like that of spvB ( 8 ) , the transcriptional activity of spvA , spvC , and spvD clearly increases in the stationary growth phase .
The ratio of the four transcripts did not appear to change during the bacterial growth cycle ; as shown in Fig. 1 , the most predominant 0.9 - kb spvA band is first detected when cells enter the stationary growth phase , followed by the spvAB , spvABC , and spvABCD messages .
The spvR gene product acts as transcriptional activator for the spvABCD genes .
Amino acid homology and recent published data suggested that spvR encodes a protein with a transcriptional activator function ( 4 , 8 , 25 , 40 ) .
To establish spvR - dependent regulation of spvA , spvB , spvC , and spvD , we analyzed their transcription with and without the presence of SpvR by comparing pSDL2 and pSD15 - 2 .
pSD15 - 2 is a pSDL2 derivative that does not encode spvR because of a TnS - oriT insertion 87 bp after the start codon of spvR , rendering S. dublin avirulent ( 2 , 21 ) .
S. dublin LD842 containing pSD15 - 2 and S. dublin Lane ( pSDL2 ) were harvested in the late stationary - phase , and total RNA was probed with gene - specific probes .
The spvR mutation in pSD15 - 2 reduced transcription of spvABCD to undetectable levels ( data not shown ) .
The spvR mutation was complemented by introduction of pUD5 , which contains spvR on a low - copy - number RK2 replicon ( 21 ) .
In S. dublin LD842 ( pSD15 - 2 , pUD5 ) , the transcriptional activity of the spvABCD genes was restored to the original levels found in pSDL2 , indicating that SpvR acts as a transcriptional activator for the downstream spv genes .
The dependence on spvR was further confirmed at the level of gene expression for spvA and spvC .
A translation termination linker introduced into the HpaI site of spvR in pSpvA - Z and pSpvC - Z was shown to reduce the , B - galactosidase activity of the resulting plasmids , pSpvA - ZmutR and pSpvC - ZmutR , respectively , more than 10 - fold in comparison to the parent plasmids ( Table 2 ) .
When this mutation was complemented by providing spvR on pFF18 in trans , full activity Was restored ( Table 2 ) .
These results clearly establish a central role for SpvR as a positive transcriptional activator of the downstream spv genes .
Primer extension analysis identifies a promoter region controlling transcription of the spvABCD genes .
Since all spv messages originate in a segment upstream of spvA , we 4486 KRAUSE ET AL. .

expected to find a transcriptional start site upstream of the start codon of spvA by primer - extension assays .
The labeled spvA primer was annealed to total RNA from late - stationaryphase cultures of S. dublin Lane , and the reverse transcriptase reaction sample was run on a sequencing gel beside an appropriate marker .
Two distinct signals - 28 nucleotides apart were obtained , suggesting the presence of two transcriptional start sites , at positions -70 and -98 upstream of the spvA initiation codon ( Fig. 5 ) .
Each putative start site was located downstream of a -10 region closely resembling the -10 region of consensus E. coli promoter sequences .
The reactions with the spvB , spvC , and spvD primers revealed the presence of multiple bands without obvious or unambiguous transcriptional starts in the regions upstream of the corresponding start codons .
These results support the previously outlined observation that spvA , spvAB , spvABC , and spvABCD messages originate in the same promoter region upstream of spvA .

expression of the downstream genes spvB and spvC .
The importance of the promoter region identified for the downstream genes was further emphasized by removal of the 320 - bp EcoRI - ApaI fragment in pFF14 and pSpvC - Z .
This deletion removed both identified transcriptional start sites as well as the start sequences of spvA ( Fig. 5 ) .
The resulting constructs , pFF14 - 1 and pSpvC - Z-1 , respectively ( Fig. 1 ) , were transferred into S. dublin LD842 ( Fig. 1 ) , in which 0 - galactosidase activity was shown to be significantly reduced compared with that of the parent plasmids ( Table 2 ) .
In contrast , the deletion of the 866 - bp PstI fragment in pFF14 did not decrease , - galactosidase activity ( pFF14 - 2 in Table 2 ) .
This result was expected , since both transcriptional start sites were located upstream of the PstI site and thus were still present in pFF14 - 2 ( Fig. 1 ) .
The intact spvB - lacZ activity in pFF14 - 2 shows that spvA and its gene product are not required for spvB expression .
This result was confirmed by introduction of pUD8 ( which produces SpvA from the pUC lac promoter ) into S. dublin LD842 carrying pFF14 - 1 or pSpvC - Z-1 .
P - Galactosidase activity was not restored , demonstrating that spvA in trans has no effect on spvB or spvC expression in the absence of the promoter region upstream of spvA .
The cis - acting effect of the 320 - bp EcoRI - ApaI deletion on spvB expression was also demonstrated at the level of transcription .
Total RNA from late - stationary - phase cultures of S. dublin LD842 harboring pSpvC - Z and S. dublin LD842 carrying pSpvC - Z-1 was probed with the B2 probe ( Fig. 4 ) .
The intense transcriptional signals seen with pSpvC - Z were almost completely abolished with pSpvC - Z-1 ( data not shown ) .
DISCUSSION We have identified an unusual operon structure of the spv virulence locus on the S. dublin virulence plasmid pSDL2 .
This study has confirmed that the spvABCD genes are transcribed and expressed in the stationary - phase of the cell growth cycle and are dependent on SpvR .

Primer extension analysis of S. dublin Lane mRNA .
The radiolabeled spvA primer was annealed to total RNA from late - stationary - phase cultures , and primer - extension was performed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase .
The reaction sample was run beside a sequencing marker with the same spvA primer ( left ) .
Two start sites are visible , which correspond to the nucleotides indicated with an asterisk and a solid arrow on the depicted sequence .
The putative -10 boxes , the start of spvA ( open arrow ) , and the ribosome - binding site ( rbs ) are marked .
regulation of these genes was found to involve a complex polycistronic transcriptional organization , with A , AB , ABC , and ABCD transcripts .
The following findings of this study confirm the operon structure of the spvABCD region .
( i ) The 5 ' end of all transcripts maps in a region upstream of spvA and results in A , AB , ABC , and ABCD messages .
( ii ) Transcriptional start sites were found upstream of spvA but not upstream of the other spv genes .
( iii ) Deletion of the region that encompasses the spvA start sites abolishes transcription and expression of the downstream genes .
By using a single probe for the spvA gene , the relative abundance of each transcript was determined by Northern blotting .
At all stages of the growth cycle , the abundance of the major transcripts decreased in the order spvA > spvAB > spvABC > spvABCD .
This quantitative measure of transcription was also reflected in the expression of the corresponding , - galactosidase fusion proteins ( Fig. 2 ) .
Although differences in translation efficiency , enzyme activity , and protein degradation dictate caution in comparing the levels of the fusion proteins , the kinetics of protein synthesis during the growth cycle strongly confirms the mRNA analysis .
Both the order of appearance and the quantity of gene - specific mRNA and fusion protein support the expression order spvA > spvB > spvC > spvD .
Progressively longer messages , from A to AB to ABC to ABCD , are seen with increasing age of the bacterial cell culture , resulting in the sequential expression of spvA , spvB , spvC , and spvD with respect to the growth phase ( Fig. 2 and 3 ) .
The mechanism responsible for the different transcript lengths may involve a combination of termination or antitermination processes within the intergenic regions A - B , B - C , and C - D ( 23 ) .
Although the intergenic regions were examined carefully for hairpin termination structures , only one segment within the B - C region was found to resemble a classic rho - independent terminator .
Interestingly , this structure was previously shown to be homologous to a hairpin loop on the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis plasmid pIBl ( 18 , 20 ) .
No significant DNA sequence homology between the different intergenic areas ( A - B , B - C , and C - D ) was detected .
Processing of polycistronic mRNA into smaller units by RNA endonucleases is an alternative mechanism that may be responsible for the observed transcription pattern ( 30 ) .
In such a case , one would expect to detect numerous additional bands by mRNA mapping which include BCD , BC , CD , B , C , and D transcripts .
Only with the spvC probes were we able to detect a 3 - kb band that could correspond to BC mRNA ( Fig. 4 ) .
It is possible that the processed mRNA products undergo rapid degradation by exonucleolytic cleavage , therefore becoming invisible on the Northern blots ( 28 ) .
It is noteworthy that the mRNA ratio of the major transcripts ( AIAB/ABC/ABCD ) remains relatively unchanged throughout the growth cycle .
This suggests that the putative termination or RNA - processing activity within the intergenic areas is not directly dependent on the growth cycle .
The simplest model to account for the changing transcription pattern during - growth involves increasing initiation at the spvA promoter , dependent on SpvR , as cells progress from log through stationary - phase .
According to this model , termination or RNA processing to produce shorter messages would occur with certain probability in the intergenic regions but would not vary with growth phase .
More frequent initiation would increase the number of short as well as longer messages , eventually raising the latter above the limit of detection .
This model accounts for the fact that the short spvA message level continues to increase throughout the growth cycle ( Fig. 3 ) .
This study has established the central regulatory role of the spvR gene product as a transcriptional activator of the downstream spvABCD genes .
SpvR appears to direct progressively increasing initiation of transcription at the spvA promoter as growth slows and the cells enter stationary phase .
SpvR contains an amino - terminal helix - turn - helix motif that has significant homology with corresponding regions of bacterial transcriptional activators of the MetR / LysR family ( 21 , 34 ) .
We have mapped the 5 ' ends of the ABCD transcripts within a region upstream of spvA , and primer - extension identified two putative transcriptional start sites - 70 and 98 bp upstream of the start codon of spvA .
The absence of transcriptional start sites upstream of the other spv genes suggests that SpvR alone activates the promoters upstream of spvA and induces polycistronic mRNA synthesis .
This was confirmed by demonstration of a cis - acting polar effect by the 320 - bp EcoRI - ApaI deletion ( deleting both promoters ) , which considerably reduced expression of the downstream spv genes .
The finding of two start sites 27 bp apart upstream of spvA implies the presence of two SpvR 4488 KRAUSE ET AL. binding sites , a phenomenon that is frequently observed in the transcriptional regulation of E. coli sigma promoters ( 6 ) .
Our study emphasizes the important role of spvR in the regulation of the other plasmid virulence genes .
The loss of virulence after spvR mutation by transposon insertions has been repeatedly demonstrated ( 2 , 4 , 34 ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that SpvR mediates a coordinate regulation of the plasmid virulence genes in the course of infection that allows the microorganisms to respond to a specific hostile environment beyond the Peyer 's patches in mesenteric lymph nodes , liver , and spleen .
The roles of SpvA , SpvB , SpvC , and SpvD remain to be determined .
Since the coordinate transcription of these genes involves polycistronic messages , the role of individual virulence genes can not be extrapolated from the effects of transposon insertions which exert polar effects on the downstream genes .
