Accumulation of RpoS relies on integration of multiple genetic controls , including regulation at the levels of transcription , translation , protein stability , and protein activity .
Growth to SP in rich - medium results in a 30 - fold induction of RpoS , although the mechanism of this regulation is not understood .
We characterized the activity of promoters serving rpoS in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and report that regulation of transcription during - growth into SP depends on Fis , a DNAbinding protein whose abundance is high during exponential - growth and very low in SP. .
A fis mutant of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium showed a ninefold increase in expression from the major rpoS promoter ( P rpoS ) during exponential - growth , whereas expression during SP was unaffected .
Increased transcription from P rpoS in the absence of Fis eliminated the transcriptional induction as cells enter SP. .
The mutant phenotype can be complemented by wild - type fis carried on a single - copy plasmid .
Fis regulation of rpoS requires the presence of a Fis site positioned at 50 with respect to P rpoS , and this site is bound by Fis in - vitro .
A model is presented in which Fis binding to this site allows repression of rpoS specifically during exponential - growth , thus mediating transcriptional regulation of rpoS .
Bacteria maintain intricate signaling networks that sense the environment and adjust cellular physiology accordingly .
In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli , less favorable growth - conditions ( e.g. , nutrient limitation , starvation , low - temperature , or osmotic shock ) initiate a general stress response by triggering the synthesis of the RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoS ( S ) .
By directing RNA polymerase to promoters of specific genes involved in stress resistance , RpoS serves as the central regulator of the general protective response , also known as stationary - phase ( SP ) , and thus increases survival ( 28 ) .
The importance of RpoS to serovar Typhimurium pathogenesis is evident from a mouse model involving lethal infections where rpoS mutants are completely avirulent ( 22 ) .
The complexity of RpoS regulation is illustrated by the variety of mechanisms reported thus far in E. coli : transcription , translation , protein turnover , and protein activity ( 28 ) .
One of the best - characterized induction phenomena is regulation of RpoS translation at low - temperature in rich - medium ( 30 °C ) .
This stimulus increases transcription of a regulatory RNA , DsrA , which can pair with an upstream antisense element in the leader region of the rpoS transcript to relieve the antisense element 's inhibition of rpoS translation ( 38 ) .
This process requires the Sm - like RNA - binding protein , Hfq , and results in activation of RpoS expression at a posttranscriptional step .
Notably , hfq mutants show normal SP induction of RpoS in rich - medium , both in E. coli ( 29 ) and in serovar Typhimurium ( our unpublished data ) .
Another regulatory pathway limiting RpoS abundance in growing cells is proteolytic degradation involving the ATPdependent ClpXP protease and a response regulator called Health Science Center , MICB , HSC - N , Morgantown , WV 26506 .
MviA ( in serovar Typhimurium ) or SprE/RssB in E. coli ( 52 , 62 ) .
In this pathway MviA is activated by an unknown stimulus through phosphorylation on D58 , which substantially increases its ability to bind to RpoS .
The relevant kinase has not yet been found ( 16 , 28 ) .
The binding event ( dependent on K173 of RpoS ) results in a sequestered nonfunctional RpoS molecule and thus can modulate RpoS activity in itself ( 8 , 75 ) .
The MviA - RpoS complex also interacts with the ClpXP protease , which then actively degrades RpoS , recycling MviA ( 44 , 52 ) .
RpoS elevates transcription of the response regulator during SP , thus constituting an autoregulatory loop in which the concentration of MviA is a limiting factor for the rate of RpoS degradation in - vivo ( 53 , 57 ) .
Perhaps the most striking induction of RpoS is observed during - growth to SP in rich - medium , where the level of induction exceeds 30 - fold , based on the activity of RpoS - responsive reporters and rpoS - lac fusions ( 28 ; unpublished data ) .
The transcriptional component of this induction ranges from 5 - to 10 - fold ( 28 , 29 ) .
Expression levels are significantly lower in the absence of guanosine tetraphosphate during both growth and SP , but the actual induction ratio is nearly unchanged ( 29 ) .
The cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) receptor protein , Crp , is also thought to be involved in rpoS transcriptional control , and yet the effect of the mutants is modest and interpretation is difficult due to the growth deficiency of the crp or cya ( defective in adenylate cyclase ) mutants in combination with growth - rate transcriptional control of rpoS ( 36 , 37 ) .
In the present study we show that the Fis protein ( factor for inversion stimulation ) is involved in RpoS regulation during growth in rich - medium .
Fis is a DNA - binding and bending protein that was initially characterized for its stimulatory role in site - specific DNA recombination ( 31 , 34 ) .
Fis has been implicated in many other processes such as stimulation of excision and integration of lambda ( 4 , 5 , 20 , 67 ) , DNA replication at oriC ( 24 , 26 , 58 ) , transposition ( 70 ) , invasion of HEp - 2 cells ( 71 ) , and transcriptional activation and repression of several 1568 VOL .
187 , 2005 Fis REGULATES INDUCTION OF RpoS IN S. ENTERICA 1569 genes , including hns , leuV , gyr , tyrT , proP , nuo , osmE , and rRNA operons ( 3 , 12 , 21 , 33 , 56 , 68 , 72 , 74 ) .
We investigate here rpoS promoter activity and demonstrate that Fis mutants have elevated expression of rpoS that is specific to exponential phase .
This pattern of regulation is in good agreement with the known variation in Fis abundance in different phases of growth : Fis is undetectable in SP but is present at over 40,000 dimers per cell upon dilution into fresh medium ( 2 , 6 , 50 ) .
Based on these results and the requirement for specific sequences upstream of the major rpoS promoter , we present an intuitive model for transcriptional regulation of rpoS in which Fis binds to and represses transcription from P rpoS .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Medium and growth - conditions .
Bacteria were grown at 37 °C ( except where noted ) in various media : Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium ( 63 ) , LB - medium containing 1 NCE minimal salts ( buffered LB - medium [ 10 ] ) , nutrient broth supplemented with5gofNaCl/liter ( NB ; Difco ) , and brain heart infusion ( BHI ; Difco ) .
Liquid minimal - medium was morpholinepropanesulfonic acid medium ( 48 ) as modified ( 11 ) , supplemented with 0.2 % glucose as the carbon and energy source .
When indicated , minimal - medium was supplemented with 1 % Casamino Acids ( Difco ) .
Plates were prepared by using nutrient agar ( Difco ) .
Antibiotics were added to final concentrations in selective media as follows : 100 g of sodium ampicillin/ml , 20 g of chloramphenicol/ml , 50 g of kanamycin sulfate/ml , and 20 g of tetracycline hydrochloride/ml , except that the ampicillin concentration was reduced to 50 g/ml for use with single - copy plasmids .
MacConkey lactose agar was prepared as described previously ( 43 ) .
X - Gal ( 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3 - indolyl - - D - galactopyranoside ) was used at 50 g/ml .
Bacterial strains and construction .
Most of the strains used in the present study were derived from wild - type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 ; all strains are described in Table 1 .
We obtained strain LT2 from John Roth .
Although this strain is the reference wild type , it has been shown to contain a nonfunctional mviA gene ( V102G substitution ) and is therefore defective in regulated RpoS turnover by ClpXP proteolysis ( 9 , 16 ) .
LT2A is a derivative of LT2 whose only known difference is that it contains a functional mviA gene .
LT2A was used to investigate RpoS proteolysis as indicated in the text ( 16 ) .
The phage P22 mutant HT105/1 int - 201 was used for transduction in serovar Typhimurium by standard methods ( 18 ) , while P1 vir was used for transduction of fusions carried on the E. coli chromosome into serovar Typhimurium strain TE7304 ( see below ) .
Transductants inheriting cya : : Tn10 and crp : : Tn10 insertions were selected on NB plates containing tetracycline and supplemented with 0.2 % glucose .
The crp * allele used in the present study was originally isolated by Ailion et al. ( 1 ) .
Construction of promoter fusions .
The system used to construct promoter fusions relies on the cloning of PCR products amplified from serovar Typhimurium LT2 chromosomal DNA .
In the GenBank sequence file AE008833 .1 ( 40 ) , the complement of the nlpD and rpoS sequences is given .
Here , positions are indicated by using coordinates from AE008833 .1 , including nlpD ( bp 13178 to 12045 ) and rpoS ( bp 11982 to 10990 ) , and coordinates are listed with the same polarity as the genes ( higher to lower numbers ) .
DNA fragments were produced with flanking EcoRI ( upstream ) and BamHI ( downstream ) sites and cloned into pRS551 to generate transcriptional lacZ - fusions ( 19 , 64 ) .
To this end , we made four different P rpoS - lac [ op ] ( operon ) fusions : construct A , bp 12764 to 12338 ( TE8744 ) ; construct D , bp 12663 to 12467 ( TE8971 ) ; construct E , bp 12663 to 12528 ( TE8868 ) ; and construct F , bp 12586 to 12467 ( TE8947 ) .
( All primer sequences are available upon request .
) The P nlpD - lac [ op ] fusion was generated in the same manner and contains the region encompassing bp 13471 to 13052 .
Recombinant plasmids were used to transform DH5 , and the fusions confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing .
The fusions were recombined into the E. coli chromosome as described previously ( 19 ) and then transduced into serovar Typhimurium by using P1 vir .
In serovar Typhimurium , they are located at the put locus in single copy .
Construction of deletion and/or insertions and point mutations .
Most other constructs were made by direct transformation of serovar Typhimurium with different DNA segments amplified by PCR , utilizing the lambda red recombination system as provided on plasmid pKD46 ( 17 ) .
Exponential - phase recipient cells , growing at 30 °C with selection for ampicillin resistance ( Amp r ) , were induced by treatment with 0.2 % arabinose for 1 h before electroporation , after which transformants were plated and selected at 37 °C .
To construct site - directed mutations in P rpoS - lac [ op ] , we developed a multistep method .
In order to prevent unwanted recombination events , a chloramphenicol resistance ( Cam r ) cassette was inserted at the native rpoS locus ( deleting bp 12720 to 12142 ) .
The Cam r cassette was amplified by using rpoS - specific primers extended to provide homology to cat at the 3 end as follows : TGCTT TTGCCGTTACGCACCAC ( upstream ) and GCCTCAGGCATTTGAGAA GCAC ( downstream ) .
The resulting insertion deleted the rpoS promoter region and gave loss of rpoS function as determined by the absence of visible catalase activity ( production of bubbles after spotting 5 l of hydrogen - peroxide on a patch of bacteria ) .
In the second step , a tetAR cassette ( pWM7 as the template [ 42 ] ) was inserted to delete the rpoS promoter of the P rpoS - lac [ op ] fusion .
Amplification used rpoS - specific primers extended to provide homology to tet at the 3 end as follows : CTCTTGGGTTATCAAGAGGG ( tetA ) ; ACTCGACAT CTTGGTTACCG ( tetR ) .
The tetAR cassette is inserted at bp 12580 to 12555 of the P rpoS - lac fusion in strain TE8864 .
In the third step , a point mutation and an in - frame deletion mutation ( both unmarked by drug resistance ) were introduced by transformation of strain TE8864 .
PCR products were prepared containing either three point mutations or an in - frame deletion of a predicted Fis binding site .
The upstream ( mutagenic ) primers used were GACCAGGTCTGCACCAAATGCCACGGTTGCAG TTGC and CACCCAGGCGGATGCAGCACAGCAAGGAGTTGTGACCAG G - - GCAGTTGCGTCTCAACCAAC , together with a downstream primer from within lacZ .
The desired transformants acquired the Fis site mutation and lost the tetAR insertion .
These transformants also acquired a functional rpoS promoter ; this allowed screening for them as Lac tetracycline - sensitive ( Tet s ) colonies that were confirmed by sequencing .
Isolation of rpoS : : MudJ insertion and construction of promoter deletions .
A large pool of MudJ insertions in LT2 was first generated by standard methods ( 30 ) .
A phage P22 lysate grown on this pool was then used to transduce strain TE8607 to Cys kanamycin resistance ( Kan r ) on minimal - medium containing X - Gal .
Blue ( Lac ) transductants were then screened by testing patches of cells grown on NB - kanamycin agar for catalase activity as described above .
Putative rpoS mutants were purified and tested by PCR and then confirmed by DNA sequencing .
The rpoS1082 : : MudJ insertion used in these experiments lies at codon 66 of rpoS ( bp 11784 ; strain TE8737 ) .
Several insertion/deletion mutations were constructed in the TE8737 background by using the tetAR cassette and the lambda red method .
This method utilized strain TE8738 , rpoS : : MudJ containing pKD46 ( 17 ) as the target for transformation with PCR - generated tetAR inserts derived from pWM7 .
The linked MudJ and tetAR insertions were then backcrossed by P22 - mediated transduction to serovar Typhimurium LT2 , and the insertion joint was confirmed by DNA sequencing ( see Table 1 for the exact location of the tetAR insertions ) .
To construct an in - frame deletion of the rpoS promoter region , we inserted tetAR to knock out P rpoS in the context of the MudJ fusion ( TE8913 ) and subsequently transformed the strain with pKD46 ( TE8915 ) .
This strain served as the recipient for transformation with a PCR product carrying an in - frame deletion of the rpoS promoter ( bp 12582 to 12540 ) .
The deletion was generated by PCR using a 60 - mer oligonucleotide with rpoS sequence interrupted by a 30 - bp deletion covering both the 35 and the 10 hexamers of the rpoS promoter : AGGAG TTGTGACCAGGTCTGCACAAAATTCCACCGTTGCA - - GAGGGCTCAG GTGAACAAAG , together with a downstream primer at bp 12301 .
Although deleted for the P rpoS promoter , lac is expressed from P nlpD in these strains ; hence , transformants were screened for a subtle Lac phenotype and confirmed as Tet s and by DNA sequencing .
RNA was isolated from wild - type LT2 cells during exponential phase by using an RNeasy minikit ( Qiagen ) .
RNA served as the template for the 5 - rapid - amplification - of - cDNA - end ( 5 RACE ) reactions performed with a BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit as described by the manufacturer ( BD Biosciences ) with one exception .
An rpoS - specific primer was used in firststrand cDNA synthesis , positioned at the initiation codon of rpoS .
RACE reaction products were eluted from 1 % agarose gels by using the NucleoTrap gel extraction kit ( BD Biosciences ) , cloned into a pCR4 - TOPO vector ( Invitrogen ) and subsequently used to transform TOP 10 Electrocomp cells ( Invitrogen ) .
Transformants were selected on NB - kanamycin plates containing X - Gal ( screening for a Lac phenotype ) .
Plasmids were analyzed by PCR amplification of the insert , followed by DNA sequencing .
Cells were centrifuged , resuspended in Z buffer ( 100 mM NaPO 4 [ pH 7.0 ] , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM MgSO 4 ) , diluted in Z buffer containing - mercaptoethanol , and then permeabilized by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate and chloroform ( 43 ) .
The samples from exponential - phase time points were concentrated before assay to be approximately equal in density to samples 1570 HIRSCH AND ELLIOTT J. BACTERIOL .

For all experiments , the exponential phase is defined by an optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of 0.25 .
Assays were performed in Z buffer containing 50 mM - mercaptoethanol by a kinetic method with a plate reader ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
Activities ( change in OD 420 per minute ) were normalized to the actual cell density ( OD 650 ) and were always compared to appropriate controls assayed at the same time .
All of the - galactosidase assays were performed within1hofthetime of sampling ; during this interval cultures were kept on ice in Z buffer .
The values shown are averages of at least three experiments with a standard deviation of 15 % unless otherwise stated .
Immunological detection of proteins .
For Western blots , cultures were grown as described in the text .
Electrophoresis and protein transfer were as described previously ( 13 , 16 ) .
After transfer to a Sequi - Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Bio - Rad ) , blots were blocked in nonfat milk and incubated in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) -- Tween containing the anti - RpoS monoclonal antibody R12 ( 13 ) , which is of the 2a isotype .
After 30 min of incubation , blots were washed twice in PBS - Tween , incubated for 30 min in PBS - Tween containing biotinylated goat anti - mouse immunoglobulin , and finally incubated with streptavidin - conjugated horseradish peroxidase ( both from Southern Biotechnology Associates ) .
Detection was performed by using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham Biosciences ) .
TE8905 harbors pFis349 ( 71 ) , which contains a 1.68 - kb DNA fragment encoding the orf1 - fis operon of serovar Typhimurium cloned into the single - copy plasmid pGS349 ( 32 ) .
Plasmid DNA isolated from an E. coli host was used to transform an r m serovar Typhimurium strain ( TE315 ) and , subsequently , wild - type ( TE8744 ) and fis ( TE8764 ) strains containing the P rpoS - lac [ op ] fusion .
Cultures were grown in LB - medium with - ampicillin and assayed for - galactosidase as described here .
DNA target fragments were amplified from the serovar Typhimurium chromosome by using primers engineered to generate EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites at opposite ends of the product .
We made three different shift targets , designated A , B , and C , that correspond , respectively , to bp 12750 to 12604 , 12643 to 12547 , and 12574 to 12475 of the P rpoS promoter .
We also generated two mutant targets derived from target B , designated B * and B , using the same primers as for B but with chromosomal templates isolated from strains TE8887 and TE8895 .
The PCR products were purified ( Qiagen ) and digested with EcoRI and BamHI restriction endonucleases .
The fragment ends were then labeled by incorporation of [ 32 P ] ATP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase as described by the manufacturer ( Promega ) and purified by using a PCR purification kit .
Radiolabeled DNA fragments ( ca. 15,000 cpm per reaction ) were incubated with purified Fis protein ( R. Johnson ) for 15 min at room temperature in buffer containing 20 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 80 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 5 % glycerol , and 2 ng of poly ( dI - dC ) / l. Binding reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 8 % native polyacrylamide gel as previously described ( 72 ) .
The gels were then dried , and the radioactive DNA was detected by autoradiography .
RESULTS SP induction of RpoS in serovar Typhimurium is normal even in the absence of regulated proteolysis .
Studies of Schweder et al. ( 62 ) and Zgurskaya et al. ( 73 ) suggest that in starving E. coli cells , RpoS abundance increases mainly as a result of increased protein stability .
Another E. coli study reports RpoS induction in the absence of an intact RpoS degradation pathway ( 52 ) .
We investigated the role of this pathway in the induction of RpoS for serovar Typhimurium grown to SP in rich - medium ( i.e. , LB - medium ) .
A katE - lac [ op ] fusion was used as a reporter of RpoS activity ( 13 , 45 ) .
Expression of the katE - lac fusion was measured both in a wild - type LT2A background and in clpX and mviA mutants defective in regulated turnover of RpoS .
( The mviA gene is the serovar Typhimurium ortholog of E. coli rssB/sprE [ 9 ] .
) During exponential - growth ( OD 600 0.25 ) , expression of katE - lac in both the clpX and mviA mutants was 5 - fold higher than in the wild type ( Fig. 1A ) .
This result is consistent with the idea that MviA and ClpXP function together to degrade RpoS during exponential - growth ( 16 , 44 , 52 ) .
A quantitatively similar increase in katE - lac expression in the mutant backgrounds was FIG. 1 .
SP induction of RpoS is normal in turnover - defective mutants .
( A ) LT2A strains harboring the RpoS reporter , katE - lac [ op ] , and carrying the indicated mutations were sampled for - galactosidase activity during exponential phase at an OD 600 of 0.25 ( E ) and after 24 h of growth ( SP ) .
SP induction was calculated as the ratio of the SP activity to the exponential - phase value ( SP/E ) .
( B ) The indicated strains were probed for RpoS protein at time points E and SP by Western analysis .
The gel for the exponential experiment was loaded with the lysate recovered from 10 - fold more cells in order to visualize low concentrations of RpoS in the LT2A background .
All strains were grown at 37 °C in LB - medium .
Strains : LT2A mviA ( TE6851 ) ; LT2A clpX ( TE6850 ) .
also observed after 24 h of growth ( defined as the SP ) .
This result suggests that the MviA and ClpXP pathway for RpoS degradation functions at a similar level during both exponential growth and at SP in LB - medium .
The normal SP induction ratio for katE - lac expression in the mviA and clpX mutants indicates that this proteolytic pathway does not regulate SP induction of RpoS ( ratio shown as SP/E , Fig. 1A ) .
Somewhat higher katE - lac activity in the mviA mutant compared to the clpX mutant is consistent with a role for MviA to sequester RpoS even if proteolysis is blocked ( 8 , 75 ) .
To confirm this result , the abundance of RpoS was determined by Western blot analysis of cells in both exponential growth and SP ( 10 - fold more material was loaded for exponential cells to allow visualization of RpoS in the wild type ) .
Both clpX and mviA mutations resulted in a marked increase in RpoS abundance compared to wild - type LT2A .
The increased amount of RpoS in the mutants appeared to be similar to the amount of RpoS detected in the LT2 strain , which is naturally defective in mviA function .
The relative increase in RpoS observed in the mutant backgrounds for cells in exponential growth is apparently the same as during SP ( Fig. 1B ) .
The combined lac fusion and Western blot results indicate that in serovar Typhimurium , the MviA/ClpXP turnover pathway does not mediate the SP induction of RpoS in LB - medium .
Promoters contributing to rpoS expression in serovar Typhimurium .
We next considered transcriptional regulation of rpoS .
Studies in E. coli ( 28 , 29 , 60 ) indicate that regulation of 1572 HIRSCH AND ELLIOTT J. BACTERIOL .

The top line depicts the genetic organization of the rpoS region , with long horizontal arrows showing gene and transcriptional polarity and with small bent arrows indicating the promoters contributing to rpoS expression .
Construct A contains the lac fusion formed by MudJ insertion at codon 66 of rpoS , and is otherwise wild type .
Constructs B to E contain the same rpoS : : MudJ insertion as construct A and , in addition , contain insertions of a tetracycline resistance ( Tet r ) cassette accompanied by deletions ( insertion/deletions ) .
Construct F is identical to construct A except it contains an in - frame deletion ( represented by slanted lines ) of the P rpoS promoter .
Construct G is like construct F but also contains the insertion/deletion from construct B .
The MudJ element is not drawn to scale .
Construction details are given in Materials and Methods , and precise insertion sites are given in Table 1 .
Shown next to each fusion is the - galactosidase activity as determined at an OD 600 of 0.25 ( E ) in cultures grown at 37 °C in LB - medium .
Strain numbers for these constructs are as follows : A , TE8737 ; B , TE8901 ; C , TE8907 ; D , TE8913 ; E , TE8914 ; F , TE8925 ; and G , TE8937 .
rpoS at the transcriptional level may be particularly important when cells grow to SP in rich - medium , in contrast to the posttranscriptional mechanisms mediating response to osmotic shock , carbon - starvation , or low - temperature .
We previously demonstrated a 15 - fold induction of an rpoS - lac transcriptional fusion when the rpoS gene was derived from E. coli and studied both in E. coli ( 29 ) and in serovar Typhimurium ( 13 ) .
Analysis of rpoS transcription in E. coli by primer - extension and in a second S. enterica serovar ( serovar Dublin ) by both primer - extension and Northern blot established that rpoS is transcribed from two distinct promoter regions ( 35 , 51 , 66 ) .
Two closely spaced and relatively weak promoters ( P nlpD ) generate a bicistronic nlpD - rpoS message , whereas the major promoter ( P rpoS ) is located approximately in the center of the nlpD gene and generates a monocistronic rpoS transcript with a long untranslated leader region of 566 nucleotides ( 35 , 51 ) .
E. coli and serovar Dublin share identical 35 and 10 hexamers for P rpoS with a 17 - bp spacer and initiate transcription at the same nucleotide .
This region of serovar Typhimurium is identical to serovar Dublin , and therefore it is likely that the defined P rpoS promoter of E. coli and serovar Dublin is conserved in serovar Typhimurium .
We investigated the transcriptional start of P rpoS in serovar Typhimurium by using RACE cDNA amplification .
Total cellular RNA harvested during exponential phase served as a template in a reverse transcription reaction that exhibits terminal transferase activity , adding three to five residues to the 3 end of the first - strand cDNA .
These residues anneal to an oligonucleotide that serves as an extended template for reverse transcriptase , thus generating a complete cDNA copy of the original RNA with a known sequence at both ends .
The first - strand cDNA is then used directly in a 5 RACE PCR to generate double - stranded cDNA products .
Three cDNA products were observed by using a primer positioned at the initiation codon of rpoS , and these corresponded to the predicted sizes of transcripts from P nlpD and P rpoS ( data not shown ) .
The product representing P rpoS was cloned and sequenced .
The results positioned the first base of the transcript 566 nucleotides upstream of the rpoS coding region at the identical initiating nucleotide of P rpoS in E. coli and serovar Dublin .
Genetic analysis of the region upstream of rpoS in serovar Typhimurium suggests a pattern of transcriptional control similar to that seen in serovar Dublin and E. coli .
We first isolated an insertion of the lac fusion - forming transposon MudJ in the VOL .

Testing autotranscription of rpoS .
LT2 strains harboring transcriptional lacZ - fusions , expressed from the indicated promoters , in either a wild - type or a rpoS mutant background , were grown at 37 °C in LB - medium for 24 h , and the - galactosidase activity was determined .
Promoter activity in the rpoS mutant is plotted as a percentage of the activity in the corresponding wild - type strain .
Strains were as follows : P rpoS ( TE8744 and TE8758 ) , P nlpD ( TE8698 and TE8761 ) , P katE ( TE6153 and TE8760 ) , and P lacUV5 ( TE6676 and TE8759 ) .
rpoS gene , forming a transcriptional - fusion of rpoS to lac ( at codon 66 of rpoS ) , to use as a reporter of in - vivo transcriptional regulation ( Fig. 2 ) .
Expression of the rpoS : : MudJ fusion was analyzed during exponential phase in combination with insertion/deletion mutations constructed with a tet cassette predicted to affect the promoters serving rpoS or a deletion mutation of P rpoS ( Fig. 2 ) .
All constructs were placed at the native rpoS locus in the bacterial chromosome .
Insertion of tet downstream of P rpoS or an insertion of tet that also makes a small deletion encompassing P rpoS eliminated detectable activity of the rpoS : : MudJ reporter ( Fig. 2 , constructs C and D , the lower limit of detection is 0.8 U ) .
In contrast , an insertion/deletion of the P nlpD promoter region but retaining P rpoS showed relatively high ( 75 % ) expression of the parental rpoS : : MudJ ( construct B ) .
In a further test , a precise in - frame deletion of 30 bp , including the conserved 35 and 10 hexamers of the P rpoS promoter , was constructed ( Fig. 2 , construct F ) .
This deletion reduces the expression of rpoS : : MudJ to 15 % of that seen in the wild type .
We conclude that , similar to rpoS transcription in E. coli , P rpoS is the major rpoS promoter and P nlpD plays a minor role in serovar Typhimurium .
Activity of the major rpoS promoter , P rpoS .
Since most transcription of rpoS originates from P rpoS , we characterized this promoter in isolation by using a lac fusion system described previously ( 19 ) in which the fusion is transferred to the serovar Typhimurium chromosome at the put locus .
The fusion used , P rpoS - lac [ op ] ( strain TE8744 ) , includes 426 bp encompassing P rpoS , from 209 to 217 with respect to the transcriptional start site .
The activity of - galactosidase was determined during exponential - growth and in SP for cultures grown at 37 °C in different media ( Table 2 ) .
Expression of the P rpoS - lac [ op ] fusion increased eightfold in SP during - growth in two different rich media , a finding which is consistent with results obtained for E. coli ( 28 ) .
Both carbon availability and the production of weak - acids have been shown to affect rpoS transcription in E. coli ( 37 , 46 , 60 ) , and we hypothesized that these stimuli might be involved in SP induction of S. enterica rpoS .
However , when activity and SP induction of P rpoS - lac [ op ] were assayed in buffered LB medium and buffered LB supplemented with 0.2 % glucose , the results were very similar to those observed in LB - medium and BHI medium .
This suggests that neither pH changes nor the lack of a suitable carbon source is responsible for SP induction .
When strain TE8744 was grown in minimal - medium ( either with or without Casamino Acids ) , rpoS - lac expression increased 3.5 - fold over expression in LB - medium .
This increase in expression was specific to exponential - growth in minimal medium .
As a result , SP induction of rpoS transcription was much reduced .
This result might be explained by growth rate regulation of rpoS transcription ; however , our previous analysis of rpoS growth - rate regulation in serovar Typhimurium indicated that it occurs mainly at a posttranscriptional level ( 16 ) .
No autotranscriptional role of rpoS .
The transcriptional start of P rpoS is preceded by a typical sigma - 70 RNA polymerasedependent promoter consensus sequence ( TTGCGT -- 17 - nucleotide spacer -- TATTCT ) .
To examine whether RpoS contributes to its own transcription , we investigated the activity of several promoters , as well as P rpoS , in both wild - type and rpoS mutant backgrounds .
Strains harboring P rpoS - lac [ op ] or a P nlpD - lac [ op ] fusion in either a wild - type or rpoS background were grown at 37 °C in LB - medium for 24 h and assayed for - galactosidase activity ( Fig. 3 ) .
A small increase in the expression of P nlpD and P rpoS was evident in the mutant background rather than the decrease predicted by a model involving selftranscription .
As a positive control , we used the katE - lac [ op ] fusion and observed a 95 % reduction in katE - lac activity in the rpoS mutant ( 13 , 59 ) .
A lacUV5 - lac [ op ] fusion was used as a negative control .
Expression of this fusion demonstrated a 15 to 20 % increase in the absence of RpoS similar to that seen with the P nlpD and P rpoS fusions .
These results confirm that RpoS is not involved in autoregulation during SP. .
The increased expression of sigma - 70 promoters in the absence of RpoS is consistent with competition of sigma factors for RNA polymerase ( 13 , 23 ) .
Computational analysis of the rpoS promoter .
To further explore the transcriptional regulation of rpoS , we used a DNA motif search engine ( http://arep.med.harvard.edu / / ) to determine potential protein - binding sites in the region of the P rpoS promoter ( Fig. 4 ) ( 55 ) .
This program utilizes the known , characterized binding sites of 59 transcriptional regulators to predict putative binding sites throughout the entire E. coli chromosome .
The results suggested putative binding sites for a large number of regulators , including CytR , CRP , DnaA , FarR , Fis , FNR , HNS , IHF , GlpR , Lrp , MalT , MetJ , MetR , NarL , OmpR , SoxS , and TyrR .
Of these , only CRP has been reported as a reg - 1574 HIRSCH AND ELLIOTT J. BACTERIOL .

Five of the most conserved base pairs in the consensus are marked with an underline ( where present in each sequence ) , and the asterisk marks the axis of rotational symmetry for the Fis consensus sequence .
ulator of rpoS transcription ( 36 , 37 ) .
We constructed tet insertion/deletions in cytR , fnr , and dps .
No role for these three genes in the control of rpoS transcription was indicated based on equivalent activity of P rpoS - lac [ op ] in the wild - type and mutant backgrounds ( data not shown ) .
The roles of Fis and CRP were further investigated .
P rpoS expression and RpoS protein level are elevated in a fis mutant .
One of the most convincing ( and intriguing ) potential binding sites was a strong Fis site centered at bp 50 with respect to the transcriptional start .
Repression of rpoS transcription by Fis was an attractive hypothesis because the amount of Fis varies substantially at different points along the growth curve : Fis is abundant during exponential phase when RpoS is at a low level , whereas the Fis level drops sharply in SP as RpoS is induced ( 2 , 6 ) .
To investigate the role of Fis in rpoS regulation , we tested the effect of a fis insertion/deletion ( 49 ) on the activity of P rpoS - lac [ op ] .
During exponential phase , P rpoS - lac expression was ninefold higher in the fis mutant than in wild type ( Fig. 5A ) .
This large increase was evident throughout exponential phase , and yet there was little difference from the wild type during SP. .
Since the negative effect of Fis is restricted to exponential phase , this finding supports a role for Fis as negative regulator of rpoS at the transcriptional level .
The activity of P rpoS - lac [ op ] in both wild - type and fis mutant backgrounds did not change even after extended growth in exponential phase , achieved by three repeated dilutions of dividing cells into prewarmed fresh LB - medium ( data not shown ) .
Western blot analysis was used to determine the abundance of RpoS protein in the fis mutant .
Samples for Western analysis were taken two mass doublings after dilution ( OD 600 0.05 ) and near the mid - exponential - phase ( OD 600 0.2 ) ( Fig. 5B ) .
At both exponential time points RpoS protein abundance appeared to be significantly higher in the fis mutant ( three - to fourfold as measured by densitometry ) .
RpoS protein observed in the fis mutant after 24 h of growth , a time when Fis levels are at a minimum , was indistinguishable from that of the wild type ( data not shown ) .
We also observed increased exponentialphase expression of the RpoS - dependent reporters katE - lac [ op ] ( threefold ) and proV - lac [ op ] ( fourfold ) in the fis mutant , a finding consistent with the Western blot analysis of RpoS protein .
Again , the specificity of the fis effect to exponential phase defines a regulatory role .
187 , 2005 Fis REGULATES INDUCTION OF RpoS IN S. ENTERICA 1575 FIG. 5 .
RpoS protein is elevated in a fis mutant .
( A ) Wild - type and fis mutant strains carrying P rpoS - lac [ op ] ( TE8744 and TE8764 , respectively ) were grown to SP , and the - galactosidase activity was determined .
The same cultures were diluted into prewarmed fresh LB medium to allow exponential - growth into SP , and the activity was determined for both E and SP. ( B ) Wild - type ( TE6285 ) and fis mutant ( TE8768 ) strains were analyzed for RpoS protein at two exponentialphase time points as described in Materials and Methods .
Complementation of the fis mutation .
To confirm that the increase in rpoS transcription in the fis mutant was due to the absence of Fis , the exponential - phase activity of P rpoS - lac [ op ] was measured in wild - type and fis mutant backgrounds harboring either the single - copy fis expression plasmid , pFis349 , or the empty vector control pGS349 ( 32 , 71 ) .
The ninefold elevation of rpoS transcription in the fis mutant was completely FIG. 6 .
Complementation of the fis mutation .
LT2 wild - type and fis mutant strains containing the P rpoS - lac [ op ] fusion and also harboring pFis349 ( fis ; TE8916 and TE8917 ) or its vector control pGS349 ( TE8911 and TE8912 ) were grown at 37 °C in LB - medium containing ampicillin .
The - galactosidase activity was determined for cultures grown to an OD 600 of 0.25 .
eliminated by pFis349 ( Fig. 6 ) .
The presence of pFis349 in the wild - type strain slightly decreased P rpoS - lac activity , a finding consistent with the idea that Fis represses rpoS transcription .
The wild - type and fis strains containing the control plasmid exhibited activities similar to those of the plasmid - free strains .
Elevation of P rpoS activity in a fis mutant depends on a predicted Fis binding site .
Fis - binding DNA sequences have been analyzed by using information analysis ( 27 ) .
In this method , known binding sites are first aligned based on highly conserved nucleotides .
The nucleotide distribution at each position within the alignment is then used to derive a weight matrix according to classic information theory ( 61 , 65 ) .
To determine the quantitative `` goodness '' of a candidate site , the relevant entries for each position in the weight matrix are summed .
If a particular position were completely conserved within the known sites , a correct match in the candidate site would contribute 2 bits to its score .
Characterized Fis sites have total scores that range from 2.5 to 15.7 , and the wellstudied ones in hin proximal to the hixL site have scores of 8 to 9 ( 27 ) , whereas the total scores for random sequences average 0 .
Information analysis has been shown to accurately predict new Fis DNA - binding sites ( 27 ) .
Software to perform the calculations is available ( http://www .
lecb.ncifcrf.gov / toms/delila.html ) , but we chose to implement these relatively simple computations as a Python script ( unpublished data ) .
Our analysis predicted a single high - scoring Fis binding site centered at position 50 with respect to the P rpoS start site ( bit score of 10.9 ; TCTGCACAAAATTCCAC CGTT , Fig. 4 ; Fis site III in Fig. 7 ) .
Only 10 of 60 characterized Fis sites have a higher score .
Weaker Fis sites near P rpoS were also predicted ( scores from 4.1 , Fig. 4B ) .
In fact , we found 83 sites with scores equal to or greater than that of rpoS Fis site III within the first 10 6 bp of the E. coli genomic sequence .
Nevertheless , since Fis is an abundant DNA - binding protein at its peak levels ( up to 100,000 monomers per cell ) , it is possible that most predicted sites are actually bound by Fis protein during exponential - growth .
The contribution of Fis site III to rpoS regulation was determined by constructing mutant derivatives of the standard P rpoS - lac [ op ] fusion ( Fig. 7 , construct A ) .
This construct displays a 9 - fold elevation during exponential - growth in the fis mutant compared to a wild - type background .
Construct B contains a deletion of Fis site III ( in frame for nlpD , deletion from 60 to 40 ) in which half of a putative CRP binding site , which overlaps Fis site III , was also deleted ( Fig. 4 and 7 ) .
This construct was nearly blind to the effect of the fis mutation and demonstrated a ratio of activity ( i.e. , fis mutant to wild type ) similar to that of the P lacUV5 - lac control ( Fig. 8 ) .
Construct C is identical to construct A except for three point mutations at critical base pairs in Fis site III [ A ( 53 ) G , T ( 48 ) G , and C ( 43 ) G ; bit score of 3.3 ] that do not alter the predicted CRP site .
This fusion also failed to show elevated expression of P rpoS in the fis mutant .
Both of the Fis site III mutations ( constructs B and C ) confer a modest defect in expression in the fis mutant compared to construct A ( 1.5 - and 2.4 - fold decrease , respectively ) , perhaps because these mutations also affect basal promoter activity slightly .
All fusions that retained the intact Fis site III were subject to control by Fis ( Fig. 7 , constructs A , D , E , and F ) .
Conversely , constructs in which Fis site III was altered or deleted ( Fig. 7 , constructs B , C , and G ) 1576 HIRSCH AND ELLIOTT J. BACTERIOL .
Transcriptional regulation of rpoS by Fis depends on Fis site III .
Construct A represents the full - length , wild - type P rpoS - lac [ op ] fusion .
Predicted Fis - binding sites ( labeled I to V ) are represented by black boxes , and predicted CRP half - sites are indicated by straight arrows .
The bent arrow represents the transcriptional start .
Construct B is a derivative of construct A carrying an in - frame deletion of the high - scoring Fis site III .
Construct C is identical to construct A except for a set of three point mutations ( represented by an asterisk ) altering conserved nucleotides of Fis site III .
In constructs D , E , F , and G , additional segments of this region are deleted as shown .
Constructs H and I are control transcriptional - fusions driven by either the P lacUV5 or the P tac promoter .
These constructs were assayed during exponential - phase growth in LB - medium in wild - type and fis mutant backgrounds .
The results are plotted as the ratio of activity in the fis strain to the activity observed in wild type .
Wild - type and fis mutant strains are , respectively , as follows : A , TE8744 and TE8764 ; B , TE8899 and TE8900 ; C , TE8887 and TE8888 ; D , TE8971 and TE8972 ; E , TE8868 and TE8869 ; F , TE9083 and TE9096 ; G , TE8947 and TE8949 ; H , TE6676 and TE8766 ; and I , TE6675 and TE8948 .
were independent of regulation by Fis .
We used the P tac promoter as a second control in addition to P lacUV5 ; its activity was not increased and in fact was slightly depressed in the fis background .
Fis protein binds to the P rpoS region .
Next , we characterized Fis binding in the P rpoS promoter region by using gel shift analysis .
All binding reactions were performed in the presence of the nonspecific competitor DNA , poly ( dI - dC ) .
As a control for these studies , we first demonstrated the binding of purified Fis protein ( R. Johnson ) to the E. coli proP 2 promoter region over the concentration range reported by Xu and Johnson ( 72 ) .
PCR products corresponding to three adjacent regions near P rpoS ( Fig. 8 , fragments A , B , and C ) were used as binding targets .
Fis bound to each of the fragments , notably with apparent affinities that reflected the score for the predicted Fis site ( s ) carried on each fragment .
Fragment B includes Fis site III required for the in - vivo effect of Fis on rpoS ( Fig. 7 ) .
This fragment exhibited binding at a low concentration of Fis ( 32 nM ) , and 90 % of the DNA target was in the bound form at 325 nM Fis .
In marked contrast , fragments A and C demonstrate 15 and 1 % , respectively , of bound target at the same Fis concentration .
To further define the contribution of Fis site III , fragment B * was generated from a template carrying the three point mutations in site III that block Fis regulation in vivo .
At a higher Fis concentration , in which the wild - type B target was essentially all ( 98 % ) in the bound form , the mutant target B * was predominantly unbound .
The B target that has a 21 - bp deletion of Fis site III also lost the ability to bind Fis .
These results suggest that Fis acts directly as a repressor of the P rpoS promoter .
Testing the interaction of CRP and Fis in the transcriptional regulation of rpoS .
In E. coli , cAMP - CRP is reported as a negative regulator of rpoS transcription during exponential phase , whereas during entry to SP the complex may activate transcription ( 28 , 39 ) .
A motif search of the P rpoS promoter region by the method of Schneider et al. ( 61 ) confirmed two putative CRP binding sites that were also previously predicted in E. coli ( 37 ) .
The higher - scoring of the two sites is centered at 63.5 and actually overlaps Fis site III ( Fig. 4 ) .

A map of the region is depicted at the top with black boxes representing predicted Fis - binding sites ( labeled I to V ) .
PCR was used to generate targets for shift assays , which are labeled A through C. For B * and B , respectively , the asterisk and the slanted lines represent either a set of three point mutations altering Fis site III or a deletion of that site .
Radiolabeled fragments were incubated with increasing concentrations of purified Fis protein and analyzed by electrophoresis on a native polyacrylamide gel as described previously ( 72 ) .
ment suggests a potential relationship between Fis and CRP in the regulation of rpoS transcription .
Coordinate transcriptional regulation between Fis and CRP has been reported for several systems ( 14 , 72 ) .
To investigate the role of CRP , we measured expression of P rpoS - lac [ op ] during exponential - growth in strains bearing the indicated mutations ( Fig. 9 ) .
These experiments were performed at 37 °C in buffered LB - medium supplemented with 0.2 % glucose to minimize any growth deficiency of the cya and crp mutants .
The cya and crp mutants both demonstrated a threefold increase in rpoS transcription during exponential phase .
When a mutant crp * gene encoding a constitutively active form of CRP was introduced into the cya mutant background , wild - type expression was restored .
In the fis crp double mutant , only a slight increase in P rpoS - lac [ op ] expression was observed compared to the fis single mutant .
Furthermore , expression in the double mutant was substantially elevated compared to that in the crp single mutant .
These results are consistent with a model in which most Fis regulation of rpoS is independent of CRP function , and is not mediated through , for example , competitive binding of the two regulators at the overlapping Fis III and CRP sites .
DISCUSSION The sigma factor RpoS has been described as the `` master regulator of the general stress response '' ( 28 ) .
It is noteworthy that this transcriptional regulatory protein is itself upregulated in response to a number of different stresses by pathways that act on diverse targets including transcription , translation , protein stability , and protein activity .
The SP induction of RpoS in rich - medium is a dramatic effect , whether observed by Western blotting of RpoS protein ( 25 ) or in a number of studies using rpoS - lac fusions , including our own work , where we estimate the magnitude of the response at 30 - fold ( 28 , 29 ; unpublished data ) .
What seems surprising is that various stimuli induce RpoS by such different mechanisms .
Starvation for carbon seems to involve mainly stabilization of the protein against attack by the ClpXP protease ( 36 , 66 , 73 ) .
Osmotic shock involves both protein stabilization ( 44 ) and a posttranscriptional effect dependent mainly on DsrA RNA and the Hfq protein .
This pathway does not lead to an increase in the amount of DsrA ( 38 ) .
In contrast , low - temperature leads to increased synthesis of DsrA RNA and Hfq - dependent activation of RpoS translation ( 54 ) .
Finally , SP induction of RpoS in 1578 HIRSCH AND ELLIOTT J. BACTERIOL .
CRP and cAMP influence rpoS transcription .
P rpoS - lac [ op ] activity was assayed during exponential phase ( OD 600 0.25 ) in strains containing the indicated mutations .
Growth was at 37 °C in buffered LB medium supplemented with 0.2 % glucose .
The crp * allele encodes a constitutively active form of the CRP protein ( independent of cAMP ) .
rich - medium involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional components ( 28 , 29 ) .
We initially eliminated the ClpXP - MviA degradation pathway as a regulator of SP induction of RpoS in rich - medium ( Fig. 1 ) .
This conclusion is consistent with the results of Pratt et al. ( 52 ) who demonstrated increased RpoS during both exponential and SP in a sprE mutant of E. coli grown in LB medium .
However , during - growth of E. coli in minimal - medium , the RpoS protein has a short half - life ( 1 min ) , and upon osmotic challenge , starvation , or switch to an acidic pH , protein stabilization is responsible for RpoS induction ( 7 , 44 , 73 ) .
These reports are consistent with only a small transcriptional induction of P rpoS during - growth to SP in minimal - medium ( Table 2 ) .
In rich media ( i.e. , LB and BHI media ) , control of SP induction of RpoS is exerted at the transcriptional and translational level , whereas in minimal - medium proteolysis seems to play the major role .
Consistent with previous reports , rpoS is transcribed from two promoter regions P nlpD and P rpoS ( 35 , 51 ) .
P nlpD is a minor contributor during both growth and SP and does not exhibit SP induction beyond the P lacUV5 control ( Fig. 2 and data not shown ) .
P rpoS is the major rpoS promoter during - growth and SP , when increased transcriptional activity coincides with elevated RpoS .
Three lines of evidence suggest that 70 recognizes P rpoS in - vivo : ( i ) the presence of an apparent 70 promoter sequence ( Fig. 4 ) , ( ii ) RpoS does not contribute to expression from its own promoter ( Fig. 3 ) , and ( iii ) RNA polymerase holoenzyme ( 70 ) transcribes this promoter in vitro ( data not shown ) .
The elevation of P rpoS activity in the fis mutant during exponential phase eliminated SP transcriptional induction , an effect that can be totally complemented by plasmid - encoded Fis .
The standard P rpoS fusion ( Fig. 7 , construct A ) contains five predicted Fis binding sites .
Fis binding was demonstrated to at least three sites ( Fig. 8 ) , suggesting a nucleoprotein complex forms near P rpoS in - vivo .
However , only Fis site III , positioned at 50 , was required for the regulatory effect .
The importance of a single Fis binding site near transcriptional start sites has been reported for two other promoters , P fis and P2 proP ( 50 , 72 ) .
In each case Fis binds to several positions , although nearly all regulation is conferred by a single Fis binding site centered at 42 ( P fis ) and 41 ( P2 proP ) from the transcriptional start sites ( 41 , 50 , 72 ) .
Transcriptional regulation by Fis at P fis causes repression , possibly by blocking RNA polymerase interactions at the 35 region .
During growth , the fis mutant displayed a ninefold elevation of P rpoS activity , although the increase of RpoS protein was estimated at three - to fourfold ( Fig. 5 ) .
This suggests that additional ( posttranscriptional ) regulation may prevent some of the expected increase in protein levels , thereby making both rpoS transcription and translation rate limiting .
Concerning the role of CRP - cAMP in the regulation of P rpoS , we suggest that it functions as a repressor although its effect is modest ( two - to threefold ) .
The relationship between CRP and Fis appears to be one of Fis epistasis .
The fis crp double mutant does not display an additive effect on P rpoS activity ; instead , but there is only a slight increase over the large effect of the fis single mutant .
From this it seems that Fis regulation does not require CRP and that full CRP regulation is hindered in the absence of Fis .
Further experimentation is necessary to define the role of CRP in the regulation of rpoS transcription .
In the present study , we document a role for the DNAbinding protein , Fis , as a negative regulatory element for RpoS , acting at the transcriptional level .
This model is intuitive , because Fis abundance varies inversely with RpoS .
Synthesis of Fis is under transcriptional control and Fis abundance varies dramatically from undetectable in SP to over 40,000 dimers per cell upon dilution into fresh medium ( 2 , 6 , 50 ) .
In E. coli , Fis displays autoregulation in which Fis protein competes with RNA polymerase for binding to the fis promoter , thus repressing its own transcription ( 6 ) .
This autoregulatory effect is less pronounced in serovar Typhimurium ( 50 ) .
In both organisms growth - phase expression of fis is thought to occur by a mechanism involving a nonoptimal region from 35 to 10 and specific base pairs near the transcriptional start site ( 69 ) .
It has been demonstrated that normal regulation is also dependent upon CRP , and in - vitro results suggest fis promoter activation in the absence of Fis , with Fis and CRP acting synergistically as transcriptional repressors ( 47 ) .
We believe that Fis probably acts directly as a repressor given that a specific site positioned at 50 is necessary for complete repression and that this site is specifically bound in vitro .
Fis activates transcription of rRNA and many other genes , including some involved in replication , so it is conceivable that Fis also works indirectly .
Further investigations into the regulation of Fis expression would provide a greater understanding of the interplay of global regulators in physiological adaptation .
