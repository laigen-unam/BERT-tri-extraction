Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica 2011 , 53:44 http://www.actavetscand.com/content/53/1/44 RESEARCH Open Access Salmonella Typhimurium invasion of HEp - 2 epithelial cells in - vitro is increased by N - acylhomoserine lactone quorum - sensing signals Live L Nesse 1 * , Kristin Berg 1 , Lene K Vestby 1 , Ingrid Olsaker 2 and Berit Djønne 1 Abstract Background : In Gram - negative bacteria , the most commonly studied quorum - sensing signals are the N - acylhomoserine lactones ( AHLs ) .
In Salmonella , AHLs are recognized by SdiA , which is believed to be a sensor of AHLs produced by other bacteria , since Salmonella does not produce AHLs itself .
It has been speculated that AHLs produced by the gastrointestinal flora may influence the regulation of virulence traits in Salmonella .
The aim of the present work was to study the effect of AHLs on epithelial cell invasion by Salmonella in - vitro .
Methods : Invasion by Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) strain and its isogenc sdiA mutant was studied using a conventional gentamycin invasion assay with HEp - 2 cells at 37 °C .
Gene expression was studied using a semi - quantitative PCR .
Results : The S. Typhimurium strain , but not its isogenic sdiA mutant , displayed increased in - vitro invasion after addition of both N - hexanoyl - DL - homoserine lactone ( C6 - AHL ) and N - octanoyl - DL - homoserine lactone ( C8 - AHL ) .
Increased expression of two of the genes in the SdiA regulon ( rck and srgE ) was observed in the wild type strain , but not in the sdiA mutant .
Conclusions : The results from the present study show that S. Typhimurium can respond to two different AHL quorum - sensing signals ( C6 - AHL and C8 - AHL ) with increased cell invasion at 37 °C in - vitro , and that this response most likely is sdiA mediated .
These results indicate that if AHLs are present in the intestinal environment , they may increase the invasiveness of Salmonella .
Introduction Bacteria can communicate through quorum - sensing signals , and they use quorum - sensing to regulate a number of physiological activities , e.g. symbiosis , virulence , competence , conjugation , antibiotic production , motility , sporulation , and biofilm formation ( for review , see [ 1,2 ] ) .
In Gram - negative bacteria , the most commonly studied quorum - sensing signals are the N - acylhomoserine lactones ( AHLs ) .
A variety of AHL molecules have been discovered which differ primarily in acyl chain length and the nature of the substituents at the C - 3 position .
AHLs are synthesized by proteins encoded by luxI gene homologues .

The AHL sensor of Salmonella is sdiA [ 3 ] .
It is believed that Salmonella acquired the sdiA gene through lateral transfer of a pseudomonad homologue to an early ancestor [ 4 ] .
However , searches in the existing databases have failed to identify any luxI homologue in available sequences [ 3 ] , indicating that Salmonella do not synthesize AHLs .
This is supported by studies showing that Salmonella did not activate any AHL reporter systems tested under the conditions employed [ 3 ] .
Consequently , Salmonella appear to be able to recognize AHL signals , but not to produce them .
SdiA is therefore believed to be a sensor of AHLs produced by other bacterial species [ 3 ] , possibly in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract [ 5 ] .
An interesting question is whether AHLs produced by the gastrointestinal flora Attribution License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0 ) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is properly cited .

In the present work , the effect of different AHLs on invasion of HEp - 2 epithelial cells by Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) was studied in - vitro .
Materials and methods Bacterial strains ThebacteriausedinthisstudywerethewildtypeS .
Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and its isogenic sdiA mutant ( ΔSTM1950 : Kan - PT7 ) which was kindly provided by Professor McClelland at Vaccine Research Institute of San Diego , USA .
As a control bacterium , known to be non - invasive , Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 was included .
Cultures were routinely grown in 5 mL Luria - Bertani ( LB ) ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) broth without agitation for approximately 18 - 20 hours at 37 °C before used in experiments .
Cell lines , culture conditions and buffers The cell line HEp - 2 ATCC CCL - 23 ( LGC Standards , Middlesex , UK ) was used in the invasion experiments .
The cells were grown in Minimum Essential Medium ( MEM ; Lonza , Basel , Switzerland ) supplemented 2 mM L - glutamine ( Lonza ) and 10 % fetal calf serum ( Merck ) at 37 °C under standard tissue culture conditions , without CO 2 in 25 cm 2 flasks ( Corning B.V. Lifesciences , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) and confluent flasks were split twice a week by trypsin - EDTA ( Lonza ) treatment and diluted 1:8 in fresh media .
When used for bacterial invasion studies , the cells were diluted 1:2 , seeded in 24 well plates ( Corning ) and incubated over night at 37 °C .
The following day , cells were counted using a Bürker chamber after staining with Trypan Blue Stain 0.4 % ( Lonza ) to quantify the mean number of cells per well .
Cell invasion studies Over night cultures were diluted 1:100 in 5 mL LB and subcultured for 3 hours in 37 °C .
Then the cultures were ten fold diluted twice , first in MEM and subsequently in MEM supplemented with either N - hexanoyl - DL - homoserine lactone ( C6 - AHL ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , St. Louis , MO , USA ) or N - octanoyl - DL - homoserine lactone ( C8 - AHL ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) to a final concentration of 1 μM/mL ( hereafter called MEMs ) .
Distilled water ( dH 2 O ) was used instead of AHL for the controls .
To measure bacterial invasion , a method based on the one described by Lissner et al. was used [ 6 ] .
Briefly : 1 mL bacteria/MEMs was added to HEp - 2 cells grown over night in 24 well plates , to a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of approximately 100 bacteria pr cell .
Plates were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C and MEMs was removed .
The cells were washed three times with 1 mL PBS de Boer ( Na 2 HPO 4 × 2H 2 O1 .34 g/L , NaH 2 PO 4 × H 2 O 0.34 g/L , NaCl 8.5 g/L , pH : 7.2 ± 0.1 ) .
Then 1 mL MEM supplemented with 250 μg/mL gentamycin ( Lonza ) ( hereafter called MEMg ) wasadded , followedbyincubationat37 °C for two hours .
MEMg was removed ; cells were washed three times with PBS de Boer and lysed with ice - cold 1 % Triton - X ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS de Boer for 10 min .
The cells were dislodged using a sterile cell scraper ( BD Falcon , Bedford , MA , USA ) , pipetted to disperse bacterial aggregates , ten fold serial diluted and plated out on blood agar to determine the number of cfu .
In each experiment , every combination of supplement and bacteria were tested in triplets , and three independent experiments were performed for each strain .
To eliminate the day to day variations , the effect of AHL addition in each experiment was calculated as fold change , i.e. : ( the mean number of intracellular cfu after addition of AHL ) / ( the mean number of intracellular cfu without addition of AHL ) , and thereafter log 10 transformed to allow calculation of confidence intervals .
Results are given as means of three independent experiments .
An increase in cell invasion was considered statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) if the value `` 0 '' was not included in the 95 % confidence interval .
Semi - quantitative PCR The bacteria were prepared and incubated with 1 μM AHL or dH 2 O as described under cell invasion studies with the exceptions that HEp - 2 cells were not present , and the incubation was performed in 100 mL LB .
After incubation , each bacterial suspension was divided into 25 mL aliquots and transferred to four 50 mL test tubes ( Greiner Bio - One , Frickenhausen , Germany ) .
To each tube , 5 mL ice cold 5 % acidic phenol ( Sigma Aldrich ) / 95 % ethanol ( Kemetyl Norge , Vestby , Norway ) were added and the mixture was kept on ice for 20 min to stabilize the mRNA [ 7 ] .
The mixture was then centrifugedat4 °C ,2330 × Gfor20min , andmostofthe supernatant discarded .
Each pellet was resuspended in the remaining supernatant .
The suspensions were pooled two and two , transferred to two Eppendorf tubes ( BRAND GMBH , Wertheim , Germany ) and centrifuged at 14 000 × G for 1 min at room temperature .
The supernatants were discarded and the pellets frozen at -70 °C until the next step in the procedure .
Total RNA was isolated from the pellets using a SV Total RNA Isolation kit ( Promega Corporation , Madison , WI , USA ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
cDNA was synthesized immediately after RNA isolation , using Invitrogen 's SuperScript ® II Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen , Ltd , Paisley , UK ) according to manufacturer 's instructions .
PCR was performed in 25 μL reaction volumes using1 μL cDNA , 0.5 μL of each primer , 0.5 μL of each dNTP and 0.2 μL Taq polymerase ( Qiagen GmbH , Hilden , Germany ) , and thermocycled by 5 min Nesse et al. .

Results and Discussion Both the S. Typhimurium wildtype strain ATCC 14028 and its isogenic sdiA mutant displayed invasion of the epithelial cell line HEp - 2 at 37 °C without addition of AHLs ( 0.5 - 2.5 * 10 5 cfu per well , depending on the day to day variation ) .
However , when 1 μM ofC8 - AHL or C6 - AHL was added , the S. Typhimurium wildtype strain displayed statistically significant higher cell invasion ( approximately two fold ) with both AHLs , as compared to the invasion without AHL ( Figure 1 ) .
No such differences were observed when testing the isogenic sdiA mutant strain , indicating that the increased cell invasion responses were sdiA dependent .
To date , SdiA is known to activate two loci , containing a total of seven genes [ 5,8 ] .
One locus , the rck operon , is located on the virulence plasmid and contains six genes .
The second locus is located on the chromosome and encodes a single gene , named srgE .
Several different AHLs , including C6 - AHL at the concentration of 1 μM , have earlier been shown to activate promotors of the genes rck and srgE in an sdiA - dependent manner in Salmonella [ 5,8 ] .
To see if these genes were activated in our experiment , we studied the expression of the genes under similar experimental conditions as the cell invasion experiments using a semi - quantitative PCR ( Figure 2 ) .
For both genes , we observed a low level of sdiA - and AHL - independent expression , as earlier reported for rck [ 5,8 ] .
In addition , the wildtype S. Typhimurium strain displayed an increased expression of both rck and srgE when 1 μM of C8 - AHL or C6 - AHL was added , whereas its isogenic sdiA mutant did not .
The results indicate that SdiA acted as an AHL induced transcriptional regulator under our experimental conditions .
Consequently , the results from the present study show that a S. Typhimurium wildtype strain did respond to both C8 - AHL and C6 - AHL with increased epithelial cell log10 fold increase 0,40 0,30 C6 - AHL C8 - AHL 0,20 0,10 0,00 -0,10 -0,20 S .

Bars show 95 % confidence interval .
When the value 0 is not included in the confidence interval , the increase is considered statistically significant , i.e. p < 0.05 .

On the other hand , SdiA activation was not observed during the transit through the gastrointestinal tract of a guinea pig , a rabbit , a cow , five mice , six pigs , or 12 chickens [ 15 ] .
Interestingly , SdiA was activated in mice that were infected with the AHL - producing pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica [ 16 ] .
These results indicate that S. Typhimurium can respond to AHLs present in the intestinal environment of these animals through the activation of SdiA .

The exact mechanisms behind the increased cell invasion that we observed are not known .
However , several genes regulated by SdiA are believed to be involved in bacteria - host interactions .
Three genes in the SdiA regulated rck operon play a role in adhesion to host tissues [ 8 ] .
It has earlier been shown that Rck promotes adherence to epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and laminin [ 9 ] , and Rck has recently also been reported to mediate a zipper - like internalization of S. Enteritidis into cells in - vitro [ 10 ] .
Two other genes in the rck operon , pefI and srgA , appear to affect the expression and function of the pef operon which encodes socalled plasmid - encoded fimbriae [ 9,11,12 ] .
The function of the rest of the genes in this operon is unknown .
Very little is also known about srgE , but recently a computerized analysis suggested that SrgE may be a secreted substrate of a type III secretion system [ 13 ] .
It has earlier been suggested that the mammalian gastrointestinal tract may be the location where SdiA detects and responds to AHLs [ 5 ] .
Although compounds that can activate AHL biosensors have been detected in the bovine rumen [ 14 ] and the avian craw ( Flodgaard , Nesse , Bergsjø & Kaldhusdahl , unpublished results ) , little is yet known about the AHL producing potential of the intestinal flora of different hosts under varying conditions .
Using a RIVETmethod ( Recombination - based In Vivo Expression Technology ) to record SdiA activity in vivo , Smith et al. observed SdiA activation during the Conclusions TheresultsfromthepresentstudyshowthatS .
Typhimurium can respond to two different AHL quorum - sensing signals ( C6 - AHL and C8 - AHL ) with increased cell invasion at 37 °C in - vitro , and that this response most likely is sdiA mediated .
This indicates that if AHLs are present in the intestinal environment , they may increase the invasiveness of S. Typhimurium into epithelial cells .
