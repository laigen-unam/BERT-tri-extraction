A Novel Insight on Signal Transduction Mechanism of RcsCDB System in Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium María de las Mercedes Pescaretti , Juan V. Farizano , Roberto Morero , Mónica A. Delgado * Instituto Superior de Investigaciones Biológicas ( Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas - Universidad Nacional de Tucumán ) and Instituto de Química Biológica `` Dr. Bernabe Bloj '' , Tucumán , Argentina Abstract The RcsCDB system of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is implicated in the control of capsule and flagella synthesis .
The hybrid sensor RcsC , the phosphotransferase RcsD and the RcsB regulator , constitute the main components of the RcsCDB system .
The proposed Rcs signaling cascade involves the autophosphorylation of RcsC and the transfer of the phosphate group to RcsB , mediated by RcsD .
We previously reported that the overexpression of rcsB repress the transcription of rcsD by an autoregulation mechanism .
Moreover , we demonstrated that during the rcsD repression , the RcsB - dependent flagellar modulation remained active .
These results suggest that the Rcs phosphorelay mechanism occurs even in the absence of RcsD .
In this work , we established the existence of two alternative phosphorelay pathways driving activation of this system .
We demonstrated that RcsC and RcsD can act as histidine kinase proteins which , after autophosphorylated , are able to independently transfer the phosphate to RcsB .
Our results suggest that these pathways could be activated by different environmental signals , leading different levels of RcsB - phosphorylated to produce a differential gene modulation .
These findings contribute to a better understanding of the complexity and importance of the Rcs system activation , where more than one phosphate flow pathway increases the possibilities to exert gene regulation for a quick environmental changes response .

* E - mail : monicad@fbqf.unt.edu.ar Introduction The RcsCDB phosphorelay system is unique and most likely presents a conserved structure and features among different bacterial species .
This is widely used by bacteria to monitor environmental changes , converting specific external signals in changes of gene expression that is required for adaptation to new conditions .
The RcsCDB is a complex unorthodox signaling system composed by the transmembrane sensor kinase RcsC , the response regulator RcsB and the RcsD transmembrane protein considered as the phosphorelay intermediary between RcsC and RcsB [ 1 ] .
In this regard , the phosphate - transfer mechanism involve several phosphate binding domains in these proteins containing a conserved H or D amino - acid - residues by which travels the phosphate group [ 1 ] .
The presence of a particular stimulus produces the autophosphorylation of the RcsC histidinekinase domain ( HK ) involving the H1 ( His 479 ) .
Afterward , the phosphate group passes , into the same protein , to D1 of the receiver domain ( Asp 875 ) [ 2 ] .
To conserve the phosphate - transfer pattern , the consecutive phosphorylation occurs in H2 of the RcsD histidine phosphotransfer domain ( HPt ) , which finally transfers this phosphate to the RcsB - D2 receiver domain [ 1,3 ] .
The Rcs phosphorelay system participates in the response to extracytoplasmic stress signaling that affect the cell envelope .
The current knowledge of the Rcs activation conditions involve the exposition to polymyxin B [ 4,5 ] , the bacteria growth at low temperature or on solid surface [ 6 ] , mutations of tolB gene , the grown of pmrA mutants in presence of iron , the punctual mutation of rcsC namely rcsC11 constitutive mutant [ 7,8 ] , the rcsB overexpression [ 9 ] , between others .
Despite of this wide variety of conditions , the specific environmental signal able to activate the Rcs system has yet to be determined .
Although the system was initially identified as the mechanism that controls the cps operon expression , required for biosynthesis of the capsular polysaccharide colanic acid [ 10 ] , it has been also implicated in the control of flagellar genes [ 11 ] , and biofilm formation [ 12 ] , as well as in other virulence processes [ 5,13 -- 15 ] .
In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) , it has been previously demonstrated that high levels of RcsB can modulate Rcs - dependent promoters , some of which are controlled in an RcsC - independent pathway [ 9,16 ] .
Moreover , we reported that the overexpression of rcsB gene lead to a negative autoregulation mechanism by repression of the rcsD transcription [ 17 ] .
However , we observed that under this state the modulation of some RcsB - dependent genes , like the flhDC operon expression , were maintained [ 17 ] .
Based on these data we ask us : why in this multi - step phosphorelay system one of its components is negatively regulated under full activation condition , and why the activity of PLOS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 September 2013  Volume 8  Issue 9  e72527 RcsCDB System Transduction Mechanism of Salmonella some RcsB - dependent promoters can be modulated in the absence of the RcsC sensor .
A possible explanation is that there could be additional signal transduction mechanisms to the previously described by Takeda et al. [ 3 ] .
In this work we studied whether RcsC and RcsD have the ability to autophosphorylate and to transfer the phosphate group to their cognate regulator .
We here examined for the first time the specificity of Rcs system component interactions necessary to drive the mentioned functions , using in - vivo and in - vitro assays .
We established that RcsC and RcsD act as independent kinase proteins able to drive the RcsB phosphorylation to control the expression of those genes required to respond at different conditions .
Taken together , our results demonstrated that the RcsCDB system activation can be carried out at least by three different phosphate flow mechanisms , two of them here described .
These findings increase the knowledge of the RcsCDB system to understand why this system is activated under several conditions .
Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table 1 .
The mutations were introduced into the bacterial chromosome by P22 - mediated transductions as described [ 18 ] .
The recombinant DNA methods were performed using the standard protocols [ 19 ] .
S. Typhimurium and Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) were grown in Luria -- Bertani ( LB ) at 30 or 37uC as noted .
Antibiotics were used at the following final concentrations : 50 mg kanamycin/ml , 50 mg ampicillin/ml and 25 mg chloramphenicol / ml .
To measure activity of cps : : MudJ or flhDC : : MudJ transcriptional fusions by rcsB gene overexpression , bacteria were grown to an OD 600 = 0.2 ( approximately 2 h ) .
Then , 0.35 mM IPTG ( final concentration ) was added to induce the overexpression of rcsB from the P lac promoter of prcsB plasmid .
After 3 h of growth , b - galactosidase activity was determined as described below .
A negative control assay was carried out using the prcsBop plasmid harboring the rcsB gene cloned in opposite direction to the lacZY promoter .
Moreover , the effect of osmotic shock by sucrose ( 0.464 M final concentration ) was assayed to measure the cps : : MudJ and flhDC : : MudJ expression under other Rcs system activation , using the protocol previously described [ 20 ] .
Mutants and Plasmid Constructions The chromosomal rcsD gene mutation of wild - type S. Typhimurium 14028s strain and the deletion of the region containing the rcsD , rcsB and rcsC genes from the E. coli BL21 DE3 strain chromosome were performed using the one - step gene inactivation method [ 21 ] .
In brief , the rcsD and rcsDBC mutations were constructed using primers 2385/4504 and 4083/4084 ( Table 2 ) , to amplify the chloramphenicol resistance cassette ( Cm ) from pKD3 plasmid .
The deletion mutations were confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing .
When was necessary the resistance cassette was removed using the plasmid pCP20 as previously described [ 21 ] .
Plasmids for overproduction of RcsCcyt or RcsDcyt were constructed by amplification of DNA fragments containing the coding sequence of the RcsC or RcsD cytoplasmic domain , including nucleotides 999 to 2847 and 990 to 2670 , respectively .
In this assay we used the S. Typhimurium 14028s genome as template and primers 4228/4201 for RcsCcyt or 4229/4202 for RcsDcyt , containing the BamHI/HindIII restriction sites ( Table 2 ) .
After digestion , the DNA fragments were cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of pT7 - 7 vector [ 22 ] .
A His 6 - tag was also added in the N - terminus of each coding sequence to facilitate the purification using Ni 2 + - NTA affinity chromatography .
Bacterial Two - hybrid ( BACTH ) Assay Studies of protein - protein interaction were performed as described by Karimova et al. [ 23 ] .
The BACTH system is based in the functional complementation of T25 and T18 fragments of the adenylate cyclase enzyme to rely the cAMP and activates the lacZY genes transcription .
The coding sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of RcsC and RcsD , and the full - length of RcsB were cloned in frame with T18 or T25 adenylate cyclase fragments , using the BACTH plasmids pUT18 , pUT18C , pKT25 and pKTN25 .
To the convenient cloning into the BACTH plasmids , the BamHI/KpnI restriction sites were introduced into the primers for rcsCcyt and rcsB , while the BamHI/XbaI was used for rcsDcyt ( Table 2 ) .
The correct in - frame junction sites were confirmed by DNA sequencing .
The E. coli DHM1 strain was then cotransformed in all possible combinations with the BACTH derivatives plasmids ( Table 1 ) .
Then , the co - transformed strains were streaked on LB plates containing the appropriated antibiotics and incubated for approximately 3 days at 30uC .
Following the Karimova et al. [ 23 ] protocol , the obtained colonies were used to inoculate LB - medium supplemented with antibiotics and 0.5 mM IPTG ( final concentration ) for plasmid selection and proteins expression , respectively .
The cultures were grown for 12 h at 30uC and then these cultures were used to determine the b - galactosidase activity as described below .
The E. coli DHM1 harboring the empty vectors pUT18 and pKT25 was used as negative proteins interaction , while E. coli DHM1 co - transformed with pKT25 - zip and pUT18C - zip plasmids , containing the leucine zippers GCN4 domain , was used as highest proteins interaction .
In addition , unspecific interactions were discarded in a new control experiments carried out using pT25 - rcsC , - rcsD or - rcsB cotransformed with empty pT18 or using pT18 - rcsC , - rcsD or - rcsB cotransformed with empty pT25 .
b - galactosidase - Assays The b - galactosidase activity was determined at room temperature in permeabilized cells as previously described [ 24 ] .
Proteins Overexpression and Purification To overexpress the proteins , 100 ml of LB - medium were inoculated with E. coli BL21 DE3 rcsDBC : : Cm mutant containing pTrcsCcyt - His 6 or pTrcsDcyt - His 6 and incubated at 37uC for 2 h to reach an OD 600nm = 0.3 -- 0.4 .
The expression of the His - tagged RcsCcyt and RcsDcyt proteins was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG and the cultures were further incubated at 30uC for 3 h ( OD 600 nm = 0.6 ) .
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 20 min at 4uC , and stored at 270uC overnight .
To protein - purification , the frozen cells were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer ( 300 mM NaCl ; 30 mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH 8.3 ; 15 mM imidazole ) containing 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and disrupted in a French pressure at 18,000 psi .
Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 g , for 40 min at 4uC .
The soluble fraction containing the proteins was mixed in batch with 2 ml of 50 % Ni 2 + - NTA agarose resin ( Qiagen ) , previously equilibrated with lysis buffer , and incubated for 3 h at 4uC to allow the binding of protein to the resin .
After centrifugation , the resin containing proteins was washed 3 times with lysis buffer containing increasing concentration of imidazole ( 30 , 50 or 100 mM , respectively ) .
Finally , the His - tagged RcsCcyt and RcsDcyt proteins were eluted from the Ni - NTA resin using 300 mM imidazole .
The purified proteins samples were supplemented with glycerol ( 50 % , v/v ) and stored at 270uC .

t002 Results The Rcs Signaling by rcsB Overexpression Requires the Presence of RcsC or RcsD In a previous study , we have demonstrated that when the threshold concentration of RcsB regulator has been reached the transcription of rcsD is suppressed , leading to a negative autoregulation mechanism of the Rcs system in S. Typhimurium [ 17 ] .
Moreover , similar repression of rcsD was observed when other Rcs system activation conditions , like rcsC11 and polymyxin B , were used [ 9,17 ] .
These results indicate that overexpression of rcsB could simulate the physiological changes that occur within the bacterial cell produced by other Rcs system - induction conditions .
In addition , the rcsC11 and igaA mutants produce a permanent activation of the Rcs system even in the absence of the environmental signals [ 7,28 ] .
Similar results were previously observed by Castanie - Cornet et al. when the Rcs phosphorelay system was activated by the expression of djlA or by overproduction of RcsB [ 29 ] .
In agreement with these data , has been reported for other regulatory systems that overproduction of the response regulator mimics the physiological phosphorylation response [ 30 -- 32 ] .
On the basis of this finding , we investigated whether the expression of rcsC and rcsD genes are essential for the signaling transduction system under high concentrations of RcsB .
For this purpose , we analyzed the expression levels of the well characterized RcsB - dependent cps operon in the absence of rcsC or rcsD genes and in the rcsC rcsD double mutant , overexpressing rcsB from prcsB plasmid .
In this assay we used the strain cps : : MudJ harboring the lacZ chromosomal transcriptional - fusion to cps operon .
The negative controls were achieved using the above strains harboring the prcsBop plasmid and growing in same condition .
As expected , high levels of cps transcription were observed in the wild - type background containing prcsB , compared with the negative control ( Fig. 1A ) .
Interestingly , rcsC and rcsD mutants displayed similar cps expression pattern , while in the rcsC rcsD double mutant no cps transcription was observed ( Fig. 1A ) .
To determine whether the RcsC and RcsD contribute to the modulation of other Rcsdependent genes , we investigated the expression of flhDC : : MudJ transcriptional - fusion , an RcsB - repressed operon [ 11 ] .
As shown in the Figure 1B we observed a remarkable decrease of flhDC expression when rcsB was overexpressed in the wild - type , rcsC and rcsD backgrounds , while no essential changes were observed in the rcsC rcsD double mutant compared with the control ( Fig. 1B ) .
Moreover , similar analyses were carried out using others RcsBdependent genes like wzz st and ugd , obtaining similar modulation patterns than cps operon ( data not shown ) .
Here we note that all complemented mutants showed same expression patterns of reporter genes than the observed in the wild - type background ( data not shown ) .
In addition , when the Rcs system was activated by osmotic shock same cps and flhDC expression pattern was obtained in the analyzed strains ( Fig. 1C and D , see Material and Methods ) .
The same effect was observed when the strains were grown at low pH as activation condition ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that the RcsB - dependent genes modulation takes place only in the presence of RcsC and/or RcsD and at high concentration of the RcsB regulator .
It is interesting to note that in the cps and flhDC expression analysis , the modulations levels were higher in the rcsD background than the values observed in the wild - type and rcsC .
These finding allows us to postulate that : i ) more than one signaling pathway can control the Rcs system activation , in which both RcsC or RcsD are able to act as histidine kinase proteins ; and ii ) the RcsC sensor is more effective in the phospho - transduction pathway .
Effect of Acetyl - phosphate on the Rcs Phosphorelay Pathway Since , the capsular and flagellar genes expression are affected by the acetyl - phosphate accumulation produced in the ackA mutant mediated by RcsB in the absence of RcsC [ 16 ] , we decided to study the effect of acetyl - phosphate in the Rcs system when RcsB is overexpressed .
To this end , we examined the expression of cps : : MudJ in the ackA rcsD , ackA rcsC and ackA rcsC rcsD backgrounds carrying the prcsB plasmid .
As shown in Figure 2 , the transcription levels of cps were 8 - fold higher in the ackA rcsD mutant under rcsB overexpression than those obtained in the wildtype context .
Moreover , we found that RcsB overproduction resulted in lower levels of cps expression in the ackA rcsC mutant compared with the wild - type levels , while in the the ackA rcsD rcsC mutant no cps transcription was observed ( Fig. 2 ) .
Similar modulation patterns were obtained when the expression of the PLOS ONE  www.plosone.org 4 September 2013  Volume 8  Issue 9  e72527 RcsCDB System Transduction Mechanism of Salmonella Figure 1 .
Modulation of cps and flhDC operons by the RcsC - or RcsD - dependent presence .
The b - galactosidase activity ( Miller units ) , produced by rcsB overexpression , from cps : : MudJ ( A ) and flhDC : : MudJ ( B ) lac transcriptional - fusions was investigated in the following genetic backgrounds : wild - type , rcsD , rcsC and rcsD rcsC , harboring the prcsB ( black bars ) or prcsBop ( grey bars ) plasmids .
These strains were grown at 37uC in LB - medium supplemented with 0.35 mM IPTG .
The osmotic shock effect by sucrose addition ( striped bars ) on cps : : MudJ ( C ) and flhDC : : MudJ ( D ) expression was investigated in the wild - type , rcsD , rcsC and rcsD rcsC strains ; and compared with control without sucrose ( empty bars ) .
These assays were performed as described in Material and Methods .
The error bars correspond to the standard deviation of three independent experiments done in duplicate .
g001 RcsB - dependent flhDC operon was analyzed ( data not shown ) .
It is important to note that no cps expression changes were observed in the tested background harboring the prcsBop plasmid used as negative control ( Fig. 2 ) .
These results demonstrate that the acetyl - phosphate is accumulated in the ackA mutant at levels able to modulate the expression of cps or flhDC in an RcsB - dependent manner only when RcsC and/or RcsD are present .
Furthermore , these data also suggest that in this condition RcsC is more efficient than RcsD in the transfer of the phosphate group directly to RcsB , because the highest cps expression was observed when only the RcsC sensor was maintained ( Fig. 2 , see ackA rcsD mutant ) .
Analysis of the Interaction between RcsC , RcsD and RcsB The results obtained to this point indicate that RcsB regulator can be activated by other pathways than the reported by Takeda et al. [ 3 ] , where only the presence of RcsC or RcsD is necessary .
These results suggest that both RcsC and RcsD should be able to interact with RcsB and with itself .
To investigate these potential protein - protein interactions we used the bacterial two - hybrid ( BACTH ) assay developed by Karimova et al. [ 23 ] .
In the Figure 3A we showed the results of such Rcs system component interactions , which were quantified as b - galactosidase activities .
We observed that RcsB is a self - interacting protein , since the b - galactosidase values produced in strains with plasmids containing rcsB fused to the T18 or T25 fragments were 12 to 25 fold higher than the negative control .
Our results of the self - interaction of RcsB are in accordance with the previously suggested by Majdalani and Gottesman [ 1 ] .
Interestingly , the BACTH assays using RcsC or RcsD fused to the N - or C - terminal domain of T18 or T25 fragments provides evidence that both proteins were also able to interact with themselves .
Here , we observed that the b - galactosidase values of RcsC - RcsC and RcsD - RcsD interactions were 12 and 5 fold higher than negative control , respectively ( Fig. 3A ) .
As expected , the data of this assay indicated that also RcsC and RcsD could interact , resulting in 10 to 22 fold increased values compared to the negative control ( Fig. 3A ) .
Furthermore , we found that RcsC and RcsD interact with RcsB , producing an increase of 6 to 22 and 6 to 19 fold b - galactosidase levels compared to the negative PLOS ONE  www.plosone.org 5 September 2013  Volume 8  Issue 9  e72527 RcsCDB System Transduction Mechanism of Salmonella control , respectively ( Fig. 3A ) .
These findings would support our assumption that these membrane proteins could independently phosphorylate the RcsB regulator .
We also verified the interactions between the Rcs system components by a glutaraldehyde cross - linking assay using the purified cytosolic domains of RcsC and RcsD ( data not shown ) .
Collectively , the BACTH and cross - linking analysis provide evidence that support our hypothesis that RcsC and RcsD are selfinteracting proteins able to activate the RcsB regulator .
Here , we suggest that the RcsB phosphorylation can be mediated by RcsC - RcsC ( homodimer ) or RcsD - RcsD ( homodimer ) interaction .
Effect of acetyl phosphate on cps expression in RcsC or RcsD - deficient cells .
The transcriptional activity of cps : : MudJ fusion , measured as b - galactosidase activity ( Miller units ) , was investigated in five genetic backgrounds : wild - type ( EG13384 ) , ackA ( MDs1557 ) , ackA rcsD ( MDs1559 ) , ackA rcsC ( MDs1558 ) and ackA rcsD rcsC ( MDs1562 ) strains , carrying the prcsB ( black bars ) or prcsBop ( grey bars ) plasmids .
The strains were grown at 37uC in LB - medium supplemented with 0.35 mM as described in Material and Methods .
The error bars correspond to the standard deviation of three independent experiments done in duplicate .
g002 Purification of RcsC and RcsD Cytoplasmic HK Domains In the majority of known sensors , involved in signal transductions by phosphorylation mechanisms , the autophosphorylation and trans - phosphorylation processes occur in their cytoplasmic domain [ 33,34 ] .
For this reason , we decided to purify the cytoplasmic domain of RcsC and RcsD in order to study the in - vitro Rcs phosphorylation .
The DNA fragments corresponding to the coding sequence of the RcsC and RcsD cytoplasmic domain were amplified from the S. Typhimurium 14028s genome and cloned into the pT7 - 7 vector .
To improve the affinity chromatography purification , the amino terminus His 6 - tag was added to Figure 3 .
In vivo interaction analysis of the Rcs components : Bacterial two - hybrid assay .
The ß - galactosidase activity expressed by E. coli DHM1 harboring derivatives plasmids encoding the rcsCcyt , rcsDcyt or rcsB genes fused to C - terminal ( top panel ) or N - terminal ( bottom panel ) of T25 fragments ( in the top of each box ) and these genes fused to N - terminal or C - terminal of the T18 fragment ( under each bar ) , was measured from bacteria growing in stationary - phase in LB - medium containing 0.5 mM IPTG .
Co - transformed cells with empty pKT25 and pUT18 vector plasmids producing basal ß - galactosidase activity levels served as negative control ( 2 ) .
Co - transformed cells with pKT25 - zip and pUT18C - zip plasmid gave high ß - galactosidase activity levels served as positive control ( + ) .
The error bars correspond to the standard deviation of three independent experiments done in duplicate .
g003 PLOS ONE  www.plosone.org 6 September 2013  Volume 8  Issue 9  e72527 RcsCDB System Transduction Mechanism of Salmonella each protein coding sequence .
The derivative pTrcsCcyt - His 6 and pTrcsDcyt - His 6 plasmids were controlled by DNA sequencing and no errors in the coding sequence of each domain were found .
Moreover , we observed that the RcsC and RcsD cytoplasmic regions were able to induce the RcsB -- dependent mucoid phenotype using the in - vivo functional analysis ( complementation assays , data not shown ) .
According to the above results we performed the purification assay by which the pTrcsCcyt - His 6 and pTrcsDcyt - His 6 plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21 DE3 rcsDBC mutant , in order to avoid E. coli Rcs proteins contamination .
The maximum level of expression was assayed using different IPTG concentrations and times for induction .
We observed that the best expression levels were obtained using 0.1 mM IPTG and further incubation at 30uC for 3 h ( data not shown ) .
The protein cytoplasmic domains were purified under native conditions by Ni 2 + - NTA affinity chromatography following the protocol detailed in Material and Methods .
The SDS - PAGE analysis confirmed the purity of this cytoplasmic domains , observed as a single band in the soluble purification fraction that correspond to the molecular weight expected to RcsCcyt and RcsDcyt ( data not shown ) .
In addition , we observed that these proteins were maintained stably along stored time .
Autophosphorylation of RcsC and RcsD Cytoplasmic HK Domains To verify the capability of RcsC cytoplasmic domain ( RcsCcyt - His 6 ) to be autophosphorylated , it was incubated with radioactive ATP ( see Material and Methods ) .
As shown in Figure 4A , a detectable radioactive signal in the gel , corresponding to the molecular weight expected for RcsCcyt - His 6 , revealed a selfphosphorylation activity .
We observed that the autophosphorylation was time - dependent reaching maximum level after 30 min of incubation , the last time assayed ( Fig. 4A ) .
We also studied whether the RcsDcyt - His 6 is a protein with selfphosphorylation activity , even when was described as unorthodox hybrid sensor lacking the conserved H - residue in the putative kinase domain [ 1 ] .
Interestingly , incubation of RcsDcyt - His 6 with [ c - 32 P ] ATP resulted in the appearance of a radioactive label band corresponding with the expected molecular weight ( Fig. 4B ) .
At difference of RcsCcyt - His 6 , the autophosphorylation signal of RcsDcyt - His 6 took place at 10 min of incubation and the phosphorylate level was not increased in prolonged times ( Fig. 4B ) .
This result suggests that RcsD can works as a histidine kinase , supporting our hypothesis where we postulated that this protein might be involved in a new Rcs transduction mechanism where the RcsC kinase sensor is not required .
Phosphate Group Transfer to RcsB To test the phosphorylation of RcsB through RcsC or RcsD histidine kinase activities , we performed an in - vitro trans - phosphorylation assay .
For this purpose , the previously self - phosphorylated [ c - 32 P ] - RcsCcyt - His 6 or [ c - 32 P ] - RcsDcyt - His 6 was incubated with the purified RcsB response regulator as detailed in Material and Methods .
To discard any RcsB autophosphorylation activity we performed a negative control incubating RcsB with [ c - 32 P ] - ATP in the absence of RcsC or RcsD .
In agreement with previous results [ 3 ] , after that the RcsB protein was mixed with [ c - 32 P ] - RcsDcyt - His 6 the phosphate group was rapidly transferred to the RcsB regulator , resulting in a radioactive signal with the RcsB molecular weight ( Fig. 5A ) .
This radioactive mark was not observed when RcsB was alone incubated with [ c - 32 P ] - ATP ( data not shown ) .
As expected , we noticed a decreased of the RcsDcyt label at the time that RcsB acquired the radioactive phosphate mark ( Fig. 5A ) .
Moreover , we also observed high trans - phosphorylation levels between RcsD and RcsB , suggesting that there is a strong affinity between them ( Fig. 5A ) .
In order to explore the possibility that RcsB could be the phosphorylation target of RcsC , we exposed the purified RcsB protein with [ c - 32 P ] - RcsCcyt - His 6 .
As shown in Figure 5B , the presence of a radioactive band of equal RcsB molecular weight revealed that a trans - phosphorylation occurs between RcsC and RcsB proteins even in the absence of RcsD .
We also observed that RcsCcyt lost its label during incubation with RcsB ( Fig. 5B ) .
These findings confirm our supposition about the presence of alternative transduction mechanisms for the Rcs system .
In these assays , we also incubated [ c - 32 P ] - RcsCcyt - His 6 or [ c - 32 P ] - RcsDcyt - His 6 with PmrA , the response regulator of the PmrAB system , in order to discard unspecific trans - phosphorylation of RcsC or RcsD .
We observed that no radioactive band was produced ( data not shown ) .
This finding suggests that RcsC and RcsD are specific kinases to produce the RcsB phosphorylation .
In conclusion , these results demonstrated by the first time that RcsC promotes the phosphorylated state of RcsB independently of RcsD protein , showing that Rcs system implied a very specialized signal transduction mechanism that allows bacteria to respond at different environmental conditions .
Discussion In comparison with other known two component systems , the Rcs phosphorelay present several important differences , positioning it as a complex phosphorelay system .
These differences mainly include the participation of two inner membrane proteins involved in the RcsB phosphorylation , the uncommon distribution of phosphate binding domains in these proteins and the wide variety of condition able to induce this system .
The above features increase the possibilities that more than one signal initiates the Figure 4 .

g005 phosphorelay cascade and affect the phosphate flow to RcsB .
In this work , we further studied the Rcs system activation mechanism .
Our results demonstrated , for the first time , that RcsC and RcsD can work independently as histidine kinase to transfer the phosphate group to RcsB .
Previously , we found that under certain condition rcsB is independent transcribed of the rcsD gene [ 9 ] .
Moreover , we reported that the Rcs system is negatively autoregulated by high levels of RcsB regulator , repressing the transcription of rcsD [ 17 ] .
These findings suggest us that in some cases the signaling pathways are independent of RcsD .
In the same direction , evidence reported by Fredericks et al. showed that modulation of RcsB - dependent promoters occurs in an RcsC - independent manner [ 16 ] .
These results allowed us to hypothesize that more than one signaling pathway may exist , in which only RcsC or RcsD are necessary .
Supporting this hypothesis , we demonstrated that the expression of both cps and flhDC operons were modulated under high RcsB levels in an rcsC or rcsD mutant .
These findings suggest that only the RcsB phosphorylated form promote modulation of gene expression , because no transcription changes were produced in the rcsC rcsD double mutant .
Moreover , we observed a strong reporter gene modulation in the rcsD mutant .
This fact could be explained assuming that no rcsD repression occurs in this mutant by RcsB , or that the retained RcsC protein is the most efficient sensor of the system .
Signal transduction model of the RcsCDB phosphorelay system .
In response to cell envelop stress , the Rcs system activation can proceed at least in three pathways : ( A ) After that an specific stimulus is sensed by RcsC , this protein is autophosphorylated and able to interacts with RcsD , leading to the transfer of phosphate group to the RcsB regulator .
The RcsB phosphorylated form is able to bind the promoter region of those target genes required to produce an instant response .
( B ) Same or different stimulus can produce the RcsC autophosphorylation forming a complex with other no phosphorylated RcsC monomer , and then the phosphate group is transferred to RcsB to modulate the gene expression .
( C ) In different growth - condition , other stimulus could be recognized by RcsD , which after autophosphorylation interacts with other no phosphorylated - RcsD monomer .
Then , the phosphate group is transferred to RcsB in order to regulate the expression of those genes necessary for bacteria adaptation .

g006 PLOS ONE  www.plosone.org 8 September 2013  Volume 8  Issue 9  e72527 RcsCDB System Transduction Mechanism of Salmonella On the other hand , we could not exclude that in absence of RcsC or RcsD the RcsB regulator is phosphorylated by a phosphodonor such as the acetyl phosphate .
To address this point , we studied the cps and flhDC operons modulation in ackA mutant producing acetyl phosphate accumulation .
We observed similar expression patterns when the cps or flhDC expressions were induced by RcsB overproduction and acetyl phosphate accumulation , but in this last condition the levels were higher than when only rcsB was overexpressed ( Fig. 1 and 2 ) .
Our results demonstrated that this gene modulation was maintained in the rcsC and rcsD mutants .
According with this notion Fredericks et al. reported that in the absence of AckA protein the cps and flhDC operons expression was controlled in an RcsC - independent manner .
These authors suggested that this effect is produced by the RcsB phosphorylation mediated only by the acetyl phosphate accumulation [ 16 ] .
However , we observed that in ackA rcsD rcsC mutant the gene modulation was abolished , indicating that the acetyl phosphate requires of RcsD or RcsC presence to generate the RcsB phosphorylation .
In addition , we note that the higher levels of gene modulation were only maintained when the rcsD gene was deleted ( Fig. 1 and 2 ) .
This observation also suggests that RcsC is the most active histidine kinase protein and that it can use acetyl phosphate as donor to phosphorylate RcsB .
Our findings demonstrated that , at least for analyzed RcsB - reporter genes , the phosphorylated - RcsB is the active form which is produced by RcsC or RcsD kinase activity but not by other proteins .
In agreement , Majdalani and Gottesman does not discard the existence of other phosphorylation pathways to previously reported , if the RcsB activity depends on its phosphorylated state [ 1 ] .
In the present work , the BACTH results revealed that both RcsC and RcsD have the ability to self - interact , suggesting that both could be able to autophosphorylate .
In addition , we found that both proteins interact with the RcsB regulator .
These findings indicate that at least two additional phosphorylation mechanisms lead to the Rcs system activation .
We propose that one of them involves the RcsC autophosphorylation and the phospho - transfer to RcsB ( RcsCRRcsB ) , and the second one implicates the RcsD autophosphorylation and transfer of the phosphate group to RcsB ( RcsDRRcsB ) .
At present , have been conducted a couple of failed efforts to purify the RcsC and RcsD active proteins .
In fact , the results of Aiso and Ohki revealed that the mRNAs from rcsC and rcsD genes were extremely unstable and rapidly degraded [ 35 ] .
On the other hand , Yamamoto et al. failed to overexpress the RcsC truncated form and could not observed self - phosphorylation activity of RcsD protein [ 34 ] .
However , in the present study , we achieved for the first time the expression and purification of the RcsC and RcsD cytoplasmic domains as stable molecules .
We observed significant autokinase activity of RcsCcyt demonstrating conclusively the ability of this sensor to self - phosphorylate .
On the other hand , the RcsD protein is considered as unorthodox sensor because the conserved H - residue of the kinase catalytic domain is missing [ 36 ] .
However , the presence of autophosphorylated RcsDcyt indicated that this protein is able to be selfphosphorylated .
Importantly , we observed that the overproduction of the truncated proteins , as well as their corresponding complete version , were able to complement the absence of chromosomal copy in the mutants rcsD rcsC , supporting the in - vitro assays results .
Majdalani N , Gottesman S ( 2005 ) The Rcs Phosphorelay : A Complex Signal Transduction System .
Moreover , our data suggested that the RcsD HK domain contains a non conserved H located near to the active site that could be used as the phospho - receptor group under a signal presence .
These results support the model of RcsCDB signal transduction postulated here , however the residues involved in each phosphorylation pathway still remain unknown .
In this sense , we are conducting experiments that focus on the study of the structure and characterization of both the RcsC and RcsD HK domains by punctual mutations , mainly of those H - residues located next to the RcsD pseudo - histidine kinase domain .
Previous experiments revealed the phosphate transfer between RcsD - HPt domain and RcsB [ 3 ] .
These authors carried out the experiments with an uncompleted RcsD cytoplasmic domain which was phosphorylated by the ArcB sensor [ 3 ] .
However , in this work we demonstrated that RcsC or RcsD cytoplasmic domains are able to transfer directly the phosphate group to RcsB regulator by in - vitro phosphotransfer assay .
The RcsB phosphorylation induced by RcsD reveals that RcsD could also work as sensor rather than an auxiliary protein .
Moreover , the large radioactivity observed in the phosphotransfer assay between RcsD and RcsB could result from the absence of phosphatase activity of RcsD , present in RcsC .
Collectively , our findings suggest that both proteins act as histidine kinase sensor for the RcsCDB system activation under different environmental conditions .
This assumption is supported by our results obtained in the in - vivo assays .
Taken together , these results allow us to postulate the following alternative phosphorylation pathways involved in the RcsB activation : i ) After RcsC sense an specific stimulus it is autophosphorylated forming a complex with other no phosphorylated RcsC monomer , then the phosphate group is transferred to RcsB to modulate the gene expression ( Fig. 6B ) ; ii ) under other environment , a different stimulus could be recognized by RcsD , which gets autophosphorylated and interacts with other RcsD monomer ; then the phosphate is transferred to RcsB in order to regulate the gene expression ( Fig. 6C ) .
We propose that the different signals could be able to activate one of each alternative signaling pathway , producing different levels of the RcsBphosphorylated form required to produce a differential gene modulation ( Fig. 6 ) .
This differential gene modulation enables bacteria adapt at diverse environments .
However , the mechanism of stimulus perception and the physiological signal remain to be elucidated .
The complexity of the phosphorelay mechanisms raises the importance of this system on the bacterial response under a multiplicity of the medium changes .
Further studies are currently in progress to explore which of the RcsB - regulated genes are controlled by the alternative mechanisms .
