McFarland , 1 Sacha Lucchini , 2 Jay C. D. Hinton , 2 and Charles J. Dorman 1 * Department of Microbiology , Moyne Institute of Preventive Medicine , Trinity College Dublin , Dublin 2 , Ireland , 1 and Molecular Microbiology Group , Institute of Food Research , Norwich Research Park , Colney , Norwich NR4 7UA , United Kingdom 2 The fim operon of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes type 1 fimbriae .
The expression of fim is controlled in response to environmental signals through a complex regulatory cascade involving the proteins FimW , FimY , and FimZ and a genetic locus , fimU , that encodes a rare arginine tRNA .
We discovered that a knockout mutation in lrp , the gene that codes for the leucine - responsive regulatory protein ( Lrp ) , inhibited fim transcription .
The loss of fim gene expression was accompanied by a corresponding loss of the mannosesensitive hemagglutination that is a characteristic of type 1 fimbriae .
Normal type 1 fimbrial expression was restored following the introduction into the knockout mutant of a plasmid carrying a functional copy of the lrp gene .
Electrophoretic mobility - shift analysis revealed no interactions between purified Lrp protein and the regulatory region of the fimA , fimU , orfimW gene .
Instead , Lrp produced protein - DNA complexes with the regulatory region of the fimZ gene , and the nature of these complexes was leucine sensitive .
DNase I footprinting showed that Lrp binds within a region between 65 and 170 with respect to the fimZ transcription start site , consistent with the binding and wrapping of the DNA in this upstream region .
Ectopic expression of the fimZ gene from an inducible promoter caused Lrp - independent type 1 fimbriation in serovar Typhimurium .
These data show that Lrp makes a positive contribution to fim gene expression through direct interaction with the fimZ promoter region , possibly by antagonizing the binding of the H - NS global repressor protein .
Type 1 fimbriae were the first bacterial fimbriae to be described ( 13 , 30 , 31 ) , and most members of the Enterobacteriaceae express them ( 2 , 3 , 22 , 35 , 44 , 47 ) .
These proteinaceous appendages are arranged peritrichously on the cell surface , where they facilitate bacterial adhesion to a variety of eukaryotic cells through interactions with mannosylated glycoproteins ( 50 ) .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses 13 putative fimbrial operons ( 10 , 33 , 42 , 48 , 56 ) .
One of these is fim , the operon encoding type 1 fimbriae .
The fim genes are expressed in - vitro in serovar Typhimurium cultures grown statically in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth and in bacteria growing in vivo in ligated bovine ileal loops ( 42 ) .
However , they are not expressed by bacteria growing on Luria agar plates under standard laboratory growth - conditions ( 49 ) .
Thus , type 1 fimbriae are subject to environmental regulation , and they have been described as having an on - off phase - variable expression pattern ( 73 ) .
They are also contributors to bacterial virulence in a number of hosts ( 4 , 5 , 8 , 32 , 53 , 71 ) .
The mechanism of phase - variable fim gene expression in serovar Typhimurium differs substantially from that in Escherichia coli , which has by far the best - characterized type 1 fimbrial gene regulatory system .
In E. coli , the inversion of a DNA element known as fimS is mediated by a site - specific recombination mechanism that alternatively connects and disconnects Moyne Institute of Preventive Medicine , Trinity College Dublin , Dublin 2 , Ireland .

the fimA structural gene to and from its promoter ( 1 , 34 ) .
In serovar Typhimurium , fim gene expression is not regulated through the reversible inversion of a cis - acting regulatory DNA motif .
Instead , control is exerted through a cluster of four regulatory genes , fimU , fimW , fimY , and fimZ , located downstream of the main fim structural operon ( Fig. 1 ) .
Transcriptional control of the structural genes is achieved primarily through the regulation of the fimA gene promoter .
The FimZ transcription factor activates this promoter directly , and it also positively regulates the transcription of its own gene , fimZ ( Fig. 1 ) ( 82 ) .
The FimZ protein is an `` orphan '' member of the response regulator family of transcription factors , that is , one for whom no cognate histidine protein kinase partner has been identified ( 83 , 84 ) .
The FimY protein is an essential coregulator that cooperates with FimZ in activating the fimA promoter through a mechanism that does not involve a direct interaction between FimY and fimA ( 72 ) .
A third regulatory protein , FimW , exerts a negative effect on fimA expression through a FimW - FimZ protein - protein interaction that is inhibitory toward the positive influence of the FimZ protein ( 74 ) .
Posttranscriptional control is a feature of both the serovar Typhimurium and E. coli fim operons .
In serovar Typhimurium , the fimU gene specifies a rare arginine tRNA that modulates the translation of the mRNA expressed by the fimY regulatory gene ( 73 ) .
In E. coli , a detachable Rho - dependent transcription terminator modulates the rate of turnover of an mRNA expressed by one key regulatory gene ( 40 , 45 ) while a rare leucine tRNA encoded by the leuX gene influences the rate of translation of another ( 65 ) .

Regulation of fim gene expression in serovar Typhimurium .
The diagram summarizes the structure of the fim gene cluster .
Filled black arrows represent structural fim genes , while unfilled arrows represent regulatory fim genes .
Other genes are shown in gray .
In each case , the direction of transcription is shown by the orientation of the arrow .
Positive regulatory inputs are shown using upward - pointing arrows , while a negative input exerted by a FimZ - FimW complex is represented by an inverted `` T '' symbol .
FimZ is an activator of the fimA and fimZ promoters .
The fimU gene acts at the level of fimY mRNA translation , and a wavy line represents the fimY transcript .
Typhimurium fimU locus inhibit fimY translation and lead to an afimbriate phenotype ( 73 ) .
The leucine - responsive regulatory protein ( Lrp ) is an 18.8 - kDa DNA binding protein that acts globally to influence transcription and other DNA transactions ( 12 , 14 , 16 , 20 , 26 , 43 , 55 , 59 , 69 , 81 ) .
Its activity can be enhanced , attenuated , or unaffected by L - leucine in different Lrp - dependent systems .
Leucine also influences the oligomeric structure of the protein , with the formation of octamers being favored when it is present ( 19 , 21 , 62 ) .
Lrp is known to regulate many fimbrial genes , and its contributions have been studied in considerable detail in the cases of the E. coli pap and fim systems .
In the E. coli fim system , it serves to modulate the efficiency of the site - specific recombination reaction that inverts the cis - acting fimS regulatory element ( 6 , 46 , 66 ) ; in the pap system , it impedes the methylation of key regulatory sequences by the DNA adenine methylase ( Dam ) protein ( 11 , 39 , 76 ) .
In both cases , Lrp directly influences the phase - variable expression of these E. coli fimbrial structural genes .
The pef genes on the pSLT virulence plasmid in serovar Typhimurium encode Pef pili and are regulated by a mechanism that is strikingly similar to that found in the E. coli pap system ( 60 ) .
Pef fimbriae are expressed in - vitro only in static cultures growing in rich media at acid - pHs ( 5 ) .
The on - off pef switch is controlled by the differential methylation of 5 - GATC - 3 sites in pef regulatory DNA by Dam .
Dam competes with Lrp for access to these sites ( 60 ) , although the distribution of high - and lower - affinity sites within the pef regulatory region is thought to differ from that in pap ( 39 ) .
Dam - Lrp competition has also been described in the cases of pili encoded by daa ( F1845 pili ) , fae ( K88 pili ) , and sfa ( S pili ) from E. coli ( 39 ) .
We aimed to discover whether Lrp could influence type 1 fimbrial gene expression in serovar Typhimurium ; here , we report a role for Lrp as a positive regulator of the serovar Typhimurium fim genes and present details of the regulatory mechanism .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Growth media and conditions .
Strains were routinely grown in LB broth at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm or on LB agar .
The expression of fimbriae in the cultures was induced by aerobic passage in static broth at 37 °C for 48 to 72 h. Motility was examined using swarm plates as described previously ( 46 ) .
To analyze pBADfimZ functionality , 0.2 % glucose or 0.2 % arabinose was incorporated into the swarm agar .
Bacterial strains and plasmids .
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
The lrp knockout mutant was complemented using plasmid pKMC102 .
This plasmid was made by amplifying the lrp gene from strain SL1344 by PCR using primer pair fwd1 .3 and rev1 .3 ( Table 2 ) .
The resulting amplicon was digested with AatII .
The single - copy - number plasmid pZC320 was digested with PmlI and AatII and ligated with the lrp gene - containing fragment .
The fimZ gene was placed under the control of the arabinose - inducible P BAD promoter .
First , the open reading frame of the fimZ gene was amplified by PCR using the primer pair and and the resulting amplicon was digested with NcoI .
Both the linearized vector and the fimZ DNA fragment were treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase to create blunt ends .
Digestion with HindIII was used to facilitate the insertion and ligation of the fimZ gene into pBAD24 in the appropriate orientation for transcription from the P BAD promoter .

Construction of the lrp mutant of SL1344 .
CJD3130 , the lrp mutant derivative of SL1344 ( Table 1 ) , was constructed by cloning the lrp gene plus flanking regions into the low - copy - number plasmid vector pCL1921 using primer pair fwd1 and rev1 ( Table 2 ) .
The BamHI fragment of pHP45 - Km , containing an - flanked kanamycin cassette , was ligated into a BglII site located 29 bp into the coding region of the cloned lrp gene .
The disrupted gene was PCR amplified using primer pair fwd1 .3 and rev1 .3 , digested with DpnI , and using pKOBEGA as described previously ( 17 ) , transduced into the strain LT2 .
The disrupted gene was retransduced into SL1344 using P22 .
The structure of the insertion mutation was confirmed by PCR and by Southern blotting ( 67 ) .
SL1344 and the isogenic lrp mutant of SL1344 were analyzed for growth in LB broth at 37 °C with shaking ( 250 rpm ) .
A typical growth curve showed a slight growth defect of the lrp mutant : SL1344 showed a mean doubling time of 28 min , while the SL1344 lrp mutant displayed a mean doubling time of 30 min .
RNA was isolated from cultures using the SV total RNA isolation kit ( Promega ) .
The RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry at A 260 .
Reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) was carried out with the OneStep RT - PCR kit ( QIAGEN ) using sample RNA at 0.6 g l 1 and the oligonucleotides listed in Table 2 .
The primer melting temperature was calculated to be 52 °C , and the number of cycles was set to 24 .
Samples were separated by gel electrophoresis in 1 % agarose -- Tris - acetate - EDTA .
Densitometry was performed using the Quantity One program ( Bio - Rad ) .
Agglutination tests were performed by incubating 50 - l aliquots of bacterial cultures with equal optical densities at 600 nm with 50 - l samples of 6 % guinea pig erythrocytes .
Mannose sensitivity was shown by a failure to agglutinate following the incorporation of D - mannose at a final concentration of 3 % ( wt/vol ) .
The lrp gene was amplified from SL1344 genomic DNA using primer pair forNdeI - lrp and revXhoI - lrp ( Table 2 ) , incorporating NdeI and XhoI restriction sites .
The amplicon was cloned into pET22b , the IPTG ( isopropyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ) - inducible protein expression plasmid , to produce pKMC301 , which expresses Lrp with a C - terminal His tag .
Lrp protein expression was induced and the protein was purified as described previously ( 46 ) .

Aliquots of approximately 50 pg of biotinylated DNA probes were incubated with binding buffer for 5 min at room temperature as described previously ( 15 ) .
Increasing concentrations of Lrp protein were added , and the mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature .
Protein - DNA complexes were formed in a reaction volume of 20 l , including L - leucine where applicable .
Ten - microliter samples of the protein - DNA mixtures , plus loading dye , were subjected to electrophoresis at 100 V on Novex 6 % DNA retardation gels ( Invitrogen ) at room temperature .
Gels were transferred onto membrane using the Novex XCell II blot module ( Invitrogen ) , UV cross - linked , and developed using the chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection module ( Pierce ) .
DNase I footprinting was carried out as previously described ( 75 ) .
The probes used for DNase I footprinting were generated by PCR using primer pair .
The sequences complementary to the T7 oligonucleotides are located outside the multiple cloning site of pBluescript .
T4 polynucleotide kinase was used to label the DNA probes at both ends with [ - 32 P ] ATP , and the probes were then digested to remove the label from one end , depending on the strand to be analyzed .
Lrp protein - DNA binding reactions used for DNase I footprinting were identical to those used for EMSA analysis , except that these reactions were performed in 50 - l volumes .
DNA sequencing reactions using dideoxy chain terminators were performed as previously described ( 75 ) by using the T4 DNA sequencing kit ( USB ) and appropriate sequencing primers .
The products of the DNase I footprinting and the DNA sequencing reactions were resolved by electrophoresis through a 6 % urea - polyacrylamide gel .
RESULTS Expression of fim genes is strongly reduced in an SL1344 lrp mutant .
Lrp is known to regulate the fimbrial genes of a number of bacterial species ( 11 , 60 , 76 ) , including the fim genes encoding the type 1 fimbriae of E. coli ( 6 , 46 , 66 ) .
In this study , we examined the effect of an lrp knockout mutation on type 1 fimbriation in serovar Typhimurium .
A characteristic of type 1 fimbriae is their ability to bind to a mannosylated glycoprotein , laminin , on the surfaces of erythrocytes .
The serovar Typhimurium strain used in this study , SL1344 , strongly agglutinates erythrocytes ( Fig. 2 ) .
We constructed an SL1344 lrp knockout mutant and investigated whether it displayed altered levels of type 1 fimbriation .
Hemagglutination assays were performed in the presence and absence of D - mannose .
SL1344 , the SL1344 lrp mutant , and the SL1344 lrp mutant complemented with pKMC102 ( lrp ) were incubated with guinea pig erythrocytes in the presence or absence of D - mannose , as described in Materials and Methods .
The lrp mutant displayed no visible agglutination activity ( Fig. 2 ) .
As expected , the wild - type strain and the complemented lrp mutant showed obvious agglutination in the absence of mannose and this hemagglutination was inhibited in the presence of mannose ( Fig. 2 ) .
Lrp regulates type 1 fimbrial genes in E. coli by participating in a DNA inversion event that is mediated by site - specific recombination .
However , the serovar Typhimurium fim gene cluster does not possess an invertible DNA switch .
Since Lrp operates as a transcription factor at promoters throughout the genome ( 43 ) , its ability to influence the transcription of genes within the serovar Typhimurium fim gene cluster was assessed by RT - PCR .
The genes tested were the structural genes fimA , fimF , and fimH and the regulatory genes fimW , fimY , and fimZ .
RNA for RT - PCR analysis was extracted from SL1344 , the SL1344 lrp mutant , and the SL1344 lrp mutant complemented with pKMC102 ( lrp ) at the stationary - phase of growth in LB broth cultures .
The results obtained showed that the transcript levels of the fimA and fimZ genes were reduced dramatically in the lrp mutant , by approximately 5 - and 10 - fold , respectively , compared to those in the wild type and the complemented mutant ( Fig. 3A ) .
The levels of transcripts of fimH ( encoding the fimbrial adhesin ) , fimF ( encoding a putative fimbrial protein ) , and fimY ( a positive regulator ) were down - regulated by 2 - , 1.4 - , and 2 - fold , respectively , in the lrp mutant .
Importantly , fimW , a negative regulator of fimbrial expression , did not show a significant difference in transcript level in the lrp mutant compared to the wild type or the complemented mutant ( Fig. 3A ) .
This result showed that the negative effect associated with VOL .

Effect of an lrp knockout mutation on mannose - sensitive hemagglutination activity in serovar Typhimurium .
The six panels show 3 % red blood cell ( RBC ) suspensions to which SL1344 , the SL1344 lrp knockout mutant ( SL1344 lrp ) , or the complemented SL1344 lrp knockout mutant [ SL1344 lrp ( pKMC102 ) , which harbors a plasmid , pKMC102 , that carries a functional copy of the lrp gene ] has been added .
Incubations were carried out in the absence ( top row ) or the presence ( bottom row ) of 3 % mannose , an inhibitor of hemagglutination mediated by type 1 fimbriae .
effect on either the fimW or the fimY transcripts .
Taken together , these RT - PCR data suggested that Lrp had a positive role in controlling the transcription of the fimA and fimZ genes .
the loss of lrp gene expression was not shared among all the genes in the fim cluster .
The RNA used in this experiment was isolated from bacteria grown under incubation conditions that were suboptimal for fimbriation .
We therefore used RNA isolated from cultures that had been grown under conditions that were ideal for the expression of type 1 fimbriae ( see Materials and Methods ) and analyzed the transcript levels expressed by the major fimbrial subunit gene ( fimA ) and the three essential regulatory genes ( fimW , fimY , and fimZ ) by RT - PCR .
This analysis showed that both the fimA and fimZ genes had decreased transcript levels in the lrp mutant ( approximately threefold lower than those in the wild type ) whereas their expression in the complemented mutant showed no difference compared to that in the wild type ( Fig. 3B ) .
In addition , the presence of the lrp mutation had no FIG. 3 .
Effect of an lrp knockout mutation on transcription within the fim gene cluster .
Reverse transcription - PCR assays were used to monitor fim gene transcription in wild - type SL1344 , the SL1344 lrp knockout mutant ( SL1344 lrp ) , and the complemented SL1344 lrp knockout mutant that harbors pKMC102 , a plasmid expressing functional Lrp protein [ SL1344 lrp ( pKMC102 ) ] .
Results are presented for bacteria grown to stationary - phase ( A ) or grown under conditions that stimulate fimbriation ( B ) .
The intensities of the bands were determined by densitometry and expressed relative to the value for SL1344 .
The experiment was performed on two separate occasions , with similar results .
Detection of Lrp - DNA interactions within the fim gene cluster by EMSA .
( A ) DNA fragments from the regulatory regions of the fimA , fimW - fimU , and fimZ genes were incubated with increasing concentrations of purified Lrp protein in the presence or absence of L - leucine .
190 , 2008 Lrp REGULATION OF fim OPERON IN SEROVAR TYPHIMURIUM 607 Lrp binds to the fimZ promoter region in - vitro .
To determine whether the effect of Lrp was direct or indirect , the interactions of this protein with the promoter regions of fimA and fimZ and with the fimW - fimU intergenic region were analyzed by EMSA .
The fimA fragment was 699 bp in length ( extending from 425 to 274 with respect to the transcription start site [ 84 ] ) .
The fimW - fimU intergenic region is 294 bp in length and extends from position 35 in the fimW open reading frame to a location that is 5 bp upstream of the start point of the fimU tRNA .
These EMSA analyses showed no direct interaction of Lrp either with the promoter region of fimA or with fimW - fimU , either in the presence or in the absence of leucine ( Fig. 4A , panel 1 and 2 ) .
The promoter region of fimZ was also examined for Lrp binding .
The fimZ transcriptional start site is located 227 bp upstream of the fimZ start codon ( 84 ) .
When a 372 - bp region encompassing the fimZ transcriptional start site ( 1 ) plus 125 bp upstream ( fragment I ) was incubated with increasing concentrations of Lrp , no interaction was seen ( Fig. 4A , panel 3 ) .
However , when this region was extended to 291 bp upstream of the fimZ transcriptional start site ( fragment II ) , an interaction with Lrp was demonstrated ( Fig. 4A , panel 4 ) .
This interaction did not appear to be modulated by leucine .
The region of Lrp binding to fimZ was characterized in more detail by EMSA in combination with a deletion analysis using nested probes , as shown in Fig. 4B .
The far - upstream probe Z103 did not show an interaction at 53 , 133 , or 266 nM Lrp , in either the presence ( lanes 1 to 3 ) or the absence ( lanes 5 to 7 ) of 15 mM leucine ( Fig. 4C ) .
Probe Z202 ( 291 to 90 ) formed three complexes , and extending the length of the probe to encompass the DNA from 291 to 8 did not result in the formation of additional complexes ( Fig. 4C ) .
This finding showed that the region important for the interaction of Lrp with the fimZ promoter is located between 90 and 190 with respect to the fimZ transcription start site ( 84 ) , a region encompassed by probe Z202 ( Fig. 4B ) .
Three complexes with Z202 were observed , suggesting that Lrp binds to up to three sites within this region ( Fig. 4C ) .
In the absence of leucine ( Fig. 4C , middle panel , lanes 2 to 6 ) , complexes 1 and 2 predominated at Lrp concentrations in the range from 27 to 53 nM ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , with increasing formation of complex 3 at Lrp concentrations in the range from 27 to 266 nM ( lanes 3 to 6 ) .
The addition of leucine altered the relative concentrations of the three complexes , but no new complexes were seen ( lanes 7 to 11 ) .
This result suggested that leucine influenced the distribution of Lrp across the sites .
DNase I footprinting analysis of Lrp binding at the fimZ promoter .
A DNase - I-protection assay was used to analyze in more detail the nature of the interaction of Lrp with the fimZ regulatory region and the effect of leucine on this interaction .
Both the coding ( Fig. 5A ) and the noncoding ( Fig. 5B ) strands of the fimZ regulatory region were examined , both in the absence and in the presence of leucine .
This analysis was done with a DNA fragment extending from positions 300 to 17 of fimZ , which was approximately equivalent to probe Z299 ( Fig. 4B ) .
The regions of protection and hypersensitivity are summarized in Fig. 5C .
Lrp protected a 90 - bp region on the coding strand , between approximately 85 and 170 with respect to the transcriptional start site ( 1 ) , from DNase I digestion ( Fig. 5A ) .
In addition , periodic hypersensitive regions , which are indicative of the bending of DNA and characteristic of Lrp , were detected at positions 71 , 84 , 112 , 113 , 144 , 145 , and 157 .
This finding suggested that Lrp had bent and/or wrapped the DNA to form a nucleoprotein complex .
The hypersensitive reaction at position 71 was seen only in the presence of leucine , as was a small region of DNase I protection extending from 70 to 65 .
DNase I footprinting of the top , noncoding strand of the fimZ regulatory region revealed a pattern of protection by Lrp that was strikingly similar to that seen on the coding strand ( Fig. 5B and C ) .
These data correlated with those from the EMSA analysis ( Fig. 4 ) .
Hypersensitive bases were also visible on the noncoding strand , at positions equivalent to those on the coding strand .
Ectopic expression of FimZ restores fimbriation in an SL1344 lrp mutant .
To examine whether the positive regulatory effect of Lrp on fimZ is required for the expression of fimbriae , an arabinose - inducible , glucose - repressible fimZ expression plasmid , pBADfimZ , was constructed ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The wild - type strain SL1344 was transformed with plasmids pBADfimZ and pBAD24 , the vector control .
The pBADfimZ construct was tested for its functionality by inoculation onto swarm plates including 0.2 % arabinose or 0.2 % glucose .
The overexpression of FimZ has been shown previously to inhibit motility by the down - regulation of the flhDC master regulatory genes , which activate flagellar expression ( 23 ) .
As expected , only the SL1344 ( pBADfimZ ) construct displayed inhibition of motility in the presence of arabinose , which was consistent with the expression of functional FimZ protein from pBADfimZ .
The expression of fimbriae by SL1344 wild - type and SL1344 lrp mutant strains containing pBADfimZ was induced as described in Materials and Methods .
SL1344 ( pBADfimZ ) showed similar levels of hemagglutination in the presence of arabinose and glucose ( Fig. 6 ) .
The pBADfimZ - containing lrp mutant showed no visible agglutination of red blood cells in the presence of glucose , which inhibited the expression of FimZ from this construct .
In the presence of 0.2 % arabinose , electrophoresis was used to detect changes in the mobility of the labeled DNA fragments caused by the formation of Lrp - DNA complexes .
A complex ( C1 ) was detected only in the case of the 538 - bp fimZ DNA fragment II ( panel A4 ) .
A nonspecific band ( X ) was detected in all lanes of panel A4 , whether Lrp protein was present or not .
( B ) The origin of the 538 - bp fimZ DNA fragment is depicted in panel B , together with that of the 372 - bp fimZ fragment I used for panel A3 and the shorter fimZ regulatory region fragments Z103 , Z202 , and Z299 used in the experiments with results shown in panel C. ( C ) The 103 - bp Z103 fimZ fragment did not form a complex with Lrp , while both the Z202 and Z299 fragments did .
Probe Z202 ( 291 to 90 ) formed three complexes ( arrows ) , and increasing the length of the probe to include the DNA from 291 to 8 ( Z299 ) did not result in the formation of additional complexes : at least two ( arrows ) were detectable with the Z299 probe .
Taken together , the data showed that the Lrp interaction with fimZ DNA occurred within the region bounded by the dashed box in panel B that was common to Z202 and Z299 .
Detection of Lrp interactions with the fimZ regulatory region by DNase - I-protection assay .
( A and B ) Lrp protein binding to the coding ( A ) and noncoding ( B ) strands of the regulatory region of the fimZ gene was detected by DNase I footprinting .
Purified Lrp protein was added to fimZ regulatory region DNA at the indicated concentrations in the presence or absence of L - leucine , as indicated above each lane .
DNA sequencing reactions were run in the lanes labeled A , C , G , and T for the coding ( A ) and noncoding ( B ) DNA strands .
Vertical dashed lines show approximately those regions where Lrp protein has protected the DNA from DNase I digestion , while arrowheads indicate bases that show hypersensitivity to the enzyme .

190 , 2008 Lrp REGULATION OF fim OPERON IN SEROVAR TYPHIMURIUM 609 FIG. 6 .
Ectopic expression of the FimZ regulatory protein reverses the effect of the lrp mutation on mannose - sensitive hemagglutination .
Hemagglutination assays were carried out with variants of strain SL1344 and the SL1344 lrp mutant containing the fimZ gene under the control of the arabinose - inducible and glucose - repressible P BAD promoter in recombinant plasmid pBADfimZ ( SL1344 pBADfimZ and SL1344 lrp pBADfimZ , respectively ) .
Equivalent numbers of bacterial cells were mixed with red blood cells ( RBCs ) in the absence or presence of 3 % ( wt/vol ) D - mannose .
which induced the P BAD promoter , the SL1344 lrp mutant showed agglutination of red blood cells at levels that were comparable to those seen with the wild - type strain SL1344 .
In all cases , this agglutination was demonstrated to be mannose sensitive ( Fig. 6 ) .
DISCUSSION This study establishes that the leucine - responsive regulatory protein , Lrp , plays a positive role in controlling the expression of type 1 fimbriae in serovar Typhimurium .
The same protein is a regulator of type 1 fimbrial gene expression in E. coli , but it acts there through a completely different mechanism .
The role of Lrp in regulating the E. coli fim genes is intimately linked to the site - specific recombination mechanism that inverts the 314 - bp fim DNA switch that harbors the promoter for the transcription of the fim structural genes ( 6 , 66 ) .
Lrp binds within this invertible DNA element but does not influence transcription from the fimA promoter ( 29 ) .
Instead , it acts as an architectural element within the fim invertasome and contributes to the distinguishing of the on and off forms of the switch at the level of the nucleoprotein complex ( 46 , 66 ) .
The serovar Typhimurium fim genes are not controlled by a DNA inversion mechanism but rely instead on a complicated regulatory cascade involving at least four regulatory genes ( Fig. 1 ) .
Our data have identified a role for the Lrp protein acting directly at the fimZ regulatory gene .
The inactivation of the lrp gene by mutation results in a loss of mannose - sensitive hemagglutination that is consistent with a failure to express type 1 fimbriae ( Fig. 2 ) , which is accompanied by a reduction of at least threefold in fimA and fimZ transcription ( Fig. 3 ) .
Both hemagglutination and fimA and fimZ transcription are restored in the lrp knockout mutant following the introduction of a recombinant plasmid that contains a functional copy of the lrp gene ( Fig. 2 and 3 ) .
The expression of the fimH gene was not as strongly affected as that of the other fim genes by the lrp mutation ( Fig. 3A ) .
This finding raises the possibility that the FimH adhesin was still present , albeit in highly truncated fimbriae .
If this was so , the adhesin had little ability to agglutinate red blood cells .
We used a combination of electrophoretic - mobility - shift and DNase - I-protection assays to locate the Lrp binding site ( s ) at the fimZ gene ( Fig. 4 and 5 ) .
Although a search was made using bioinformatic methods and EMSA , we found no evidence for Lrp binding in the promoter region of the fimA , fimU , orfimW gene ( Fig. 4 ) .
All our results indicate that Lrp exerts its positive effect on type 1 fimbriation in serovar Typhimurium through the modulation of fimZ regulatory gene transcription .
The EMSA data suggest that Lrp forms three complexes upstream of the fimZ promoter and that this interaction is modulated by L - leucine ( Fig. 4 and 5 ) .
Although Lrp can form high - affinity nonspecific complexes with DNA , these complexes are not usually influenced by leucine ( 62 ) .
The DNase I protection studies permitted the identification of regions upstream of fimZ that became hypersensitive to DNase I digestion in the presence of the Lrp protein .
Lrp likely binds among those hypersensitive regions , bending the DNA between its binding sites and opening the DNA duplex there to enhanced DNase I digestion , as has been described in previous Lrp studies ( 79 , 80 ) .
These findings , along with data from the EMSA analysis , suggest that there are three binding sites for Lrp amid the hypersensitive bases in the protected region .
These regions were examined for sequences with similarity to the Lrp consensus sequence YAGHAWATTWTDCTR ( 24 , 25 , 63 ) .
Three sites ( Fig. 5C ) show mismatches of three , four , and five bases compared to the consensus sequence .
Site I , centered at 100 and having a mismatch of five bases , is located in the region covered by fimZ probe I ( Fig. 4B ) , which did not show any interaction with Lrp in the EMSA .
It is tempting to hypothesize that Lrp binding at site I may require cooperative binding to sites II and III , centered at 129 and 152 , respectively , and that complex 3 , seen in the EMSA analysis with probe Z202 , indicates the occupation of this site .
Certainly , the cooperative binding of DNA is a recurring theme in studies of Lrp ( 20 , 36 , 37 , 62 , 63 ) .
Purified Lrp protein protects bases in the regions extending from approximately 85 to 119 , 121 to 140 , and 146 to 170 on both strands from DNase I digestion in - vitro ( Fig. 5 ) .
Each of these regions of protection contains a match to the consensus sequence for Lrp binding sites ( Fig. 5C ) .
The presence of the Lrp protein results in hypersensitivity to DNase I digestion in the case of certain bases on both the coding and noncoding strands .
This elevated sensitivity is known to be consistent with the wrapping of the DNA around the protein , which results in the exposure of specific bases to enhanced DNase I cleavage ( 61 , 77 ) .
The EMSA data suggest that leucine influences the cooperativeness of Lrp binding to fimZ DNA ( Fig. 4 ) .
However , the pattern of DNase I hypersensitivity seen in the fimZ regulatory region was independent of leucine except in the region from 65 to 71 ( Fig. 5 ) .
This result suggests that once purified Lrp protein has bound to its target sequences , leucine has only a modest influence on the protein - DNA interaction .
However , the EMSA data indicate that leucine can also influence Lrp - DNA interaction further upstream , within the sequences encompassed by probe Z202 ( Fig. 4C ) .
Thus , leucine 610 MCFARLAND ET AL. .
does have an influence on Lrp - fimZ interaction , but it is a subtle one that requires further study .
The ectopic expression of the fimZ regulatory gene from plasmid pBADfimZ made the expression of mannose - sensitive hemagglutination independent of the lrp gene .
This result provides strong evidence that fimZ is the primary point at which the Lrp protein interacts with the fim gene cluster .
It is also completely consistent with data from EMSA and DNase I footprinting experiments that show physical interaction of the Lrp protein with the fimZ regulatory region .
The Lrp binding sites identified in the fimZ regulatory region are located far upstream from the transcription start site .
The closest is centered at position 100 , making it unlikely that the positive effect of Lrp on fimZ transcription involves direct protein - protein interaction with RNA polymerase unless the intervening DNA is looped .
FimZ is known to regulate the expression of its own gene positively , raising the possibility that Lrp can potentiate the positive effect of FimZ at the P fimZ promoter .
A 7 - bp sequence ( 5 - AATAAGA - 3 ) that is known to be required for FimZ binding at fimA is centered at position 352 upstream of fimZ ( 84 ) .
Binding at this far - upstream location may mean that FimZ interaction with RNA polymerase requires the intervening DNA to be bent by the Lrp protein .
Certainly , the relative locations of the putative FimZ binding site at 352 and the Lrp sites at 152 and 100 are consistent with such a model .
Another attractive mechanism involves the Lrp - mediated ( or Lrp - and FimZ - mediated ) remodeling of the fimZ promoter region to displace a transcriptional repressor .
The H - NS protein is a global repressor of transcription in gram - negative bacteria , and it has high affinity for A T - rich DNA sequences ( 9 , 27 , 28 , 54 , 58 , 64 , 70 ) .
The fimZ gene is unusually A T rich , and two independent chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have shown that the H - NS protein binds to it ( 54 , 57 ) .
Moreover , the inactivation of the hns gene resulted in the up - regulation of fimZ transcription by 17 - fold in a previous transcriptomic experiment ( 57 ) .
Our finding ( Fig. 2 ) that Lrp can activate fimZ transcription by at least 10 - fold under growth - conditions comparable to those used in the H - NS transcriptomic experiments is consistent with the hypothesis that Lrp derepresses fimZ by the displacement of H - NS .
In light of the positive regulation of fimZ by the FimZ protein , H - NS displacement could be achieved by Lrp alone or by Lrp acting in combination with FimZ .
This type of antirepression mechanism is a common theme in studies of H - NSmediated negative regulation of transcription , and it is becoming clear that a wide variety of DNA binding proteins are capable of dislodging the repressor ( 18 , 52 , 75 , 78 ) .
The involvement of the global regulators Lrp and H - NS in addition to the fim - specific proteins FimW , FimY , and FimZ is likely to make the fim gene cluster sensitive to environmental stimuli and to the physiological state of the cell .
In the future , it will be important to discover what role , if any , these factors play in the phase variation of serovar Typhimurium type 1 fimbriae .
