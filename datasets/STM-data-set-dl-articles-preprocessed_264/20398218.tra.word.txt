An antisense RNA that governs the expression kinetics of a multifunctional virulence gene Eun - Jin Lee and Eduardo A. Groisman * Department of Molecular Microbiology , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Washington University School of Medicine , Campus Box 8230 , 660 S. Euclid Ave. , St. Louis , Missouri , 63110 , USA Summary Genome - wide transcriptome analyses of several bacterial species have recently uncovered a hitherto unappreciated amount of antisense transcription .
However , the physiological role , regulation and significance of such antisense transcripts are presently unclear .
We now report the identification of a cis - encoded 1.2 kb long antisense RNA -- termed AmgR -- that is complementary to the mgtC portion of the mgtCBR polycistronic message from Salmonella enterica .
The mgtCBR mRNA specifies the MgtC protein , which is necessary for survival within macrophages , virulence in mice and growth in low Mg 2 + ; the Mg 2 + transporter MgtB with no apparent role in virulence ; and the membrane peptide MgtR mediating MgtC degradation .
Expression of AmgR dimished both MgtC and MgtB protein levels in a process requiring RNase E but independent of RNase III , the RNA chaperone Hfq , and the regulatory peptide MgtR .
Inactivation of the chromosomal amgR promoter increased MgtC and MgtB protein levels and enhanced Salmonella virulence .
Surprisingly , AmgR transcription is governed by the regulatory protein PhoP , which also directs transcription of the sense mgtCBR mRNA .
AmgR may function as a timing device that alters MgtC and MgtB levels after the onset of PhoP - inducing conditions .
Keywords antisense RNA ; MgtB ; MgtC ; PhoP ; Salmonella Introduction The transcriptome profile of bacteria can be exceedingly complex .
In addition to the mRNAs corresponding to annotated open reading frames and the non - coding RNAs of known function such as rRNAs , tRNAs and regulatory small RNAs , vast amounts of cisencoded antisense transcripts have been recently uncovered in a variety of bacterial species including Helicobacter pylori ( Sharma et al. , 2010 ) , Escherichia coli ( Mendoza - Vargas et al. , 2009 ) , Vibrio cholerae ( Liu et al. , 2009 ) , and Listeria monocytogenes ( Toledo - Arana et al. , 2009 ) .
Unfortunately , the conditions that govern the synthesis of these anti - sense RNAs , as well as their physiological role and mechanism of action remain largely unknown .
We now report the identification of a novel antisense RNA that , surprisingly , is under direct control of the transcription factor promoting expression of the sense RNA that it regulates .
MgtC is an inner membrane protein that mediates intramacrophage survival , virulence in mice , and growth in low Mg 2 + in several intracellular bacterial pathogens ( Alix & Blanc - Potard , 2007 , Blanc - Potard & Groisman , 1997 , Buchmeier et al. , 2000 , Grabenstein et al. , 2006 , Lavigne et al. , 2005 , Maloney & Valvano , 2006 , Retamal et al. , 2009 , Smith et al. , NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Results 1998 ) .
MgtC 's role in the ability of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to survive within macrophages has been separated genetically from that mediating growth in low Mg 2 + ( Rang et al. , 2007 ) .
Yet , the specific biochemical activity carried out by the MgtC protein is yet to be established .
In Salmonella , the mgtC gene heads a three - gene operon , being followed by mgtB , which codes for a Mg 2 + transporter ( Snavely et al. , 1991 ) , and mgtR , encoding a 30 - amino - acid peptide required for MgtC proteolysis by the FtsH protease ( Alix & Blanc - Potard , 2008 ) ( Fig. 1A ) .
By contrast , the mgtC and mgtB genes belong to separate transcription units in certain bacterial species ( Fig .
S1 ) ( Blanc - Potard & Lafay , 2003 ) while other species harbor mgtC but not mgtB ( Fig .
S1 ) ( Blanc - Potard & Lafay , 2003 ) .
Homologues of mgtR have not been reported yet .
Transcription of the Salmonella mgtCBR operon is induced in low ( i.e. , 10 µM ) Mg 2 + ( Snavely et al. , 1991 , Soncini et al. , 1996 ) sensed by the PhoQ protein ( Garcia Vescovi et al. , 1996 ) , which promotes the phosphorylated state of the PhoP protein ( Shin & Groisman , 2005 , Shin et al. , 2006 ) .
PhoP recognizes an hexanucleotide direct repeat in the mgtC promoter ( Zwir et al. , 2005 ) .
On the contrary , there is no mgtCBR transcription in organisms experiencing high ( i.e. , 10 mM ) Mg 2 + ( Snavely et al. , 1991 , Soncini et al. , 1996 ) because PhoQ favors the unphosphorylated state of PhoP protein under these conditions ( Shin et al. , 2006 ) .
The mgtCBR mRNA includes a 296 - nucleotide leader that appears to contribute to the Mg 2 + - responsive expression of the mgtC gene ( Cromie et al. , 2006 , Spinelli et al. , 2008 ) , and a 219 - nucleotide intergenic region of unknown function separating the mgtC and mgtB open reading frames ( Fig. 1B ) .
In this paper , we describe the identification and characterization of a 1.2 kb - long cisencoded antisense RNA that is transcribed from a promoter located in the unusually long mgtC - mgtB intergenic region .
We demonstrate that , unexpectedly , the regulatory protein PhoP directs transcription of both the sense mgtCBR transcript and the newly identified antisense RNA .
The antisense RNA is critical for the production of physiological amounts of the MgtC and MgtB proteins because altering expression of the antisense RNA affected Salmonella 's ability to grow in low Mg 2 + and to cause a lethal infection in mice .
Identification of a PhoP - activated antisense RNA complementary to the mgtC mRNA The mgtC and mgtB coding regions are separated by 219 nucleotides ( Fig. 1B ) , raising the possibility of the downstream mgtB gene being transcribed from a separate promoter than the upstream mgtC gene .
However , mgtB expression appears to be strictly dependent on the promoter located upstream of the mgtC gene because a MudJ transposon insertion in the mgtC gene or a four - nucleotide substitution in the PhoP binding site in the mgtC promoter abolished expression of both the MgtC and MgtB proteins ( Fig .
To gain further insight into the regulation of the mgtCBR operon , we carried out Northern blot analysis with RNA harvested from wild - type Salmonella grown in minimal media with different Mg 2 + concentrations .
We observed multiple bands in samples corresponding to bacteria grown in very low ( i.e. , 10 µM ) Mg 2 + , but not following growth in high Mg 2 + , when we used a double - stranded DNA probe corresponding to the leader region preceding the mgtC open reading frame ( Fig .
We then reexamined the blots using strand - specific riboprobes corresponding to the same region and found multiple bands when examining the sense strand ( data not shown ) but a single 1.2 kb long transcript corresponding to the antisense strand for mgtC .
The latter transcript was produced at maximal levels following growth in very low ( i.e. , 10 µM ) Mg 2 + and could not be detected in samples corresponding to bacteria grown in high Mg 2 + ( Fig. 2A ) .
In agreement with these results , S1 nuclease protection assays identified a transcript originating in the mgtC - mgtB intergenic region that Mol Microbiol .

Lee and Groisman Page 3 was produced when Salmonella was grown in 10 or 25 µM Mg 2 + but not in 1 mM Mg 2 + ( Fig. 2B ) .
NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript To map the 5 ' end of the identified antisense RNA , we used 5 ' RACE ( rapid amplification of cDNA ends ) and obtained three different transcription start sites in five independent clones .
One site is present 145 nucleotides downstream of the mgtC stop codon , corresponding to the mgtC - mgtB intergenic region and in the same general area found in the S1 - mapping experiment ( Fig. 2B ) .
The other two 5 ' RACE products are located within the mgtC coding region 148 and 154 nucleotides upstream of its stop codon ; their origin and significance remain unknown as products of the corresponding sizes were not detected by Northern blot or S1 - mapping .
Thus , during - growth in very low Mg 2 + Salmonella produces an antisense transcript that initiates in the mgtC - mgtB intergenic region ( Fig. 1B ) and extends beyond the 5 ' end of mgtC coding region ( Fig. 1A ) .
We termed this transcript AmgR for antisense for mgtC regulator .
We reasoned that AmgR was likely to be transcriptionally controlled by the PhoP protein given that PhoP 's cognate sensor PhoQ is activated during - growth in low Mg 2 + ( Garcia Vescovi et al. , 1996 ) .
In agreement with this prediction , S1 - mapping demonstrated that the AmgR product detected in wild - type Salmonella grown in 10 or 25 µM Mg 2 + was not present in the isogenic phoP mutant ( Fig. 2B ) .
Still , because PhoP is required for transcription of the sense mgtCBR transcript ( Soncini et al. , 1996 ) , it was possible that the phoP mutant lacked AmgR due to AmgR destabilization resulting from the absence of the mgtCBR mRNA with which it is largely complementary ( Fig. 1A ) .
Indeed , AmgR was not detected in a Salmonella strain with a four - nucleotide substitution in the PhoP box of the mgtC promoter that abolishes mgtC expression ( Fig. 2B ) .
Therefore , we re - evaluated the possibility of PhoP being necessary for AmgR transcription initiation by carrying out S1 experiments with RNA harvested from four isogenic strains with a mutation inactivating the chromosomal copy of the mgtC promoter , a wild - type or mutant phoP gene , and carrying either the plasmid vector pUH21 - 2lacI q or plasmid pmgtC , where the mgtC gene is transcribed from a derivative of the lac promoter that is PhoP independent , and which does not include the sequences corresponding to the amgR promoter .
AmgR was produced by the phoP + strain carrying plasmid pmgtC when grown in the presence of the gratuitous inducer of the lac promoter IPTG but not in its absence ( Fig. 2C ) .
Conversely , AmgR was not detected in the phoP mutant strain carrying pmgtC regardless of whether IPTG was added to the culture ( Fig. 2C ) .
AmgR was also absent from the strains harboring the plasmid vector pUH21 - 2lacI q ( Fig. 2C ) .
These data define AmgR as a novel PhoP - dependent transcript that is apparently unstable in the absence of the complementary mgtCBR mRNA .
AmgR transcription from a heterologous promoter silences MgtC and MgtB expression We initially compared the levels of the MgtC and MgtB proteins in isogenic Salmonella strains harboring either plasmid pBAD - amgR , where AmgR is expressed from a heterologous promoter , or the plasmid vector pBAD18 .
Western blot analysis revealed that both MgtC and MgtB were produced in the vector - harboring cells grown in 10 µM Mg 2 + but not when grown in 25 µM , 50 µM or 1 mM Mg 2 + ( Fig .
S4A ) , reflecting that transcription of the mgtCBR operon is regulated by the levels of Mg 2 + in the media ( Snavely et al. , 1991 , Soncini et al. , 1996 ) .
By contrast , neither MgtC nor MgtB were detected in bacteria carrying pBAD - amgR at all investigated Mg 2 + concentrations ( Fig .
To examine the specificity of AmgR regulatory action , we introduced pBAD - amgR ( or the vector control pBAD18 ) into isogenic strains harboring chromosomal lac transcriptional fusions in either the mgtB or mgtA coding regions .
( The mgtA gene encodes a protein that is 50 % identical to MgtB and is transcribed from a PhoP - activated promoter located elsewhere in the genome .

Lee and Groisman Page 4 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript pBAD - amgR than when harboring the plasmid vector ( Fig .
This effect appears to be specific for mgtB - lac because the mgtA - lac strain exhibited slightly higher β - galactosidase activity when harboring pBAD - amgR than with the plasmid vector at intermediate Mg 2 + concentrations ( Fig .
The higher mgtA - lac expression displayed by the strain with pBAD - amgR may reflect derepression of the Mg 2 + - responding riboswitch in the mgtA leader ( Cromie et al. , 2006 ) possibly caused by a decrease in cytosolic Mg 2 + resulting from AmgR - promoted lowering of MgtC and/or MgtB protein levels ( Fig .
The AmgR - expressing plasmid pBAD - amgR impaired growth of wild - type Salmonella in 10 µM Mg 2 + ( Fig .
This likely reflects downregulation of MgtC levels ( Fig .
S4A ) and that MgtC is required for growth in low Mg 2 + ( Blanc - Potard & Groisman , 1997 ) .
Importantly , the pBAD - amgR - carrying bacteria grew as well as those with pBAD18 at 1 mM Mg 2 + ( Fig .
S4E ) , indicative that AmgR 's inhibitory effect is limited to low Mg 2 + conditions .
These results demonstrated that AmgR can function in trans to diminish the amounts of the MgtC and MgtB proteins .
Inactivation of the amgR promoter enhances MgtC and MgtB expression and growth in low Mg 2 + The phenotypes described above could be due to AmgR being expressed at nonphysiological levels from a heterologous promoter in a multi - copy number plasmid .
Thus , to test the role of AmgR when produced at normal levels , we constructed a strain with a threenucleotide substitution in the chromosomal copy of the predicted − 10 region of the amgR promoter ( Fig. 1B ) , which , as anticipated , failed to produce AmgR ( Fig .
We then compared the amounts of MgtC and MgtB proteins present in crude extracts from wild - type and amgR strains grown at three different Mg 2 + concentrations for 4 and 5 h .
The amgR promoter mutation had two striking effects : First , expression of the MgtC protein following 5 h growth in 10 µM Mg 2 + when none is detected in the wild - type strain at this time ( Fig. 3A ) .
And second , expression of both the MgtC and MgtB proteins in bacteria grown in 50 µM Mg 2 + for 5 h , a condition under which these proteins are not observed in the wild - type strain ( Fig. 3A and 3B ) .
The amgR promoter mutant grew better than the wild - type strain in 10 µM Mg 2 + ( Fig. 3C ) , suggesting that MgtC is a limiting factor for Salmonella 's ability to grow in low Mg 2 + .
By contrast , wild - type and amgR promoter mutant strains grew similarly in 1mM Mg 2 + ( Fig. 3D ) , a condition where neither MgtC nor MgtB are produced at detectable levels ( Fig. 3A and 3B ) .
Cumulatively , these data indicate that AmgR normally downregulates the levels of the MgtC protein , and to lesser extent of the MgtB protein .
AmgR decreases MgtC and MgtB protein levels in an mgtR - independent fashion We considered the possibility that AmgR action might be exerted via MgtR because this peptide promotes the FtsH - mediated degradation of the MgtC protein ( Alix & Blanc - Potard , 2008 ) and because AmgR preferentially affects MgtC protein levels ( Fig. 3A and 3B ) .
Thus , we compared the MgtC and MgtB protein levels in isogenic wild - type and mgtR strains harboring either plasmid pBAD - amgR or the vector pBAD18 .
MgtC and MgtB levels were lower in cells carrying pBAD - amgR than in those with the vector control , and this was true for both wild - type and mgtR Salmonella ( Fig .
As expected , the levels of the MgtC protein were higher in the mgtR mutant than in the wild - type strain in cells harboring the plasmid vector ( Fig .
S6A ) , and the levels of the MgtB protein were not affected by the presence of mgtR ( Fig .
These results indicated that the AmgR - promoted decrease in MgtC and MgtB protein levels is not mediated by mgtR .

Lee and Groisman Page 5 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript AmgR promotes decay of the mgtC RNA in an RNase E - dependent fashion Regulatory RNAs use a variety of mechanisms to modulate gene expression including degradation of their mRNA targets ( Krinke & Wulff , 1990 , Waldbeser et al. , 1995 ) and interference with translation of open reading frames in the mRNAs ( Brantl , 2002 , Gerdes & Wagner , 2007 , Weaver , 2007 ) .
We determined that there were lower amounts of mgtC mRNA in wild - type Salmonella than in the amgR promoter mutant following 5 h growth in 10 µM Mg 2 + ( Fig .
No differences were observed following growth in 10 µM Mg 2 + for 2 h or in 10 mM Mg 2 + for 2 or 5 h ( Fig .
The mRNA levels corresponding to mgtA , which was used as control , were similar in wild - type and amgR Salmonella under all investigated conditions ( Fig .
To examine whether AmgR affected the stability of the polycistronic mgtCBR message , we harvested RNA from bacteria experiencing inducing PhoP conditions and then treated with rifampicin to inhibit gene transcription .
In the wild - type strain , the mgtC portion of the message was less stable than the mgtB portion ( Fig. 4A and 4B ) .
This is due , at least in part , to AmgR because 89 % of the mgtC transcript remained in the amgR promoter mutant 1 min after addition of rifampicin whereas only 59 % was still present in the wild - type strain ( Fig. 4A ) .
AmgR appears to target primarily the mgtC mRNA because the wild - type strain and the amgR promoter mutant displayed similar decay rates for the mgtB mRNA ( Fig. 4B ) and for the mgtA mRNA ( Fig. 4C ) , which was used as control .
While the amgR promoter mutant harbors higher levels of MgtB protein than the wild - type strain when grown in 50 µM Mg 2 + for 5 h ( Fig. 3A ) , the decay rates for the mgtB mRNA have only been determined following growth in 10 µM Mg 2 + for 3.5 h ( Fig. 4B ) and could be different under other conditions .
We wondered whether the AmgR - promoted degradation of the mgtC mRNA was mediated by RNase E , which is a major player in mRNA turnover ( Deutscher , 2006 ) .
Because RNase E is essential , we compared the mgtC mRNA levels in a set of four isogenic strains with a wild - type or mutant amgR promoter , and harboring the wild - type or a ts allele of rne ( Figueroa - Bossi et al. , 2009 ) .
Organisms were grown at the permissive temperature of 30 °C overnight and then transferred into inducing medium ( N - minimal - medium containing 10 µM Mg 2 + ) at 37 °C to partially inactivate the rne gene product .
( We used 37 °C instead of the preferred temperature of 42 °C because the rne mutant failed to grow in the defined minimal medium at 42 °C , as previously reported ( Spinelli et al. , 2008 ) ) .
We then harvested RNA at different times and examined the transcripts by Northern blot hybridization using a probe specific for the mgtC gene .
The decrease in mgtC RNA levels taking place in the wild - type strain between 3.5 and 5 h post induction at 37 °C requires both AmgR and RNase E because neither the rne and amgR single mutants nor the rne amgR double mutant ( Fig. 4D ) exhibited the dramatic decrease in mgtC mRNA levels displayed by the isogenic rne + amgR + strain ( Fig. 4D ) .
More mgtC mRNA remained in the amgR mutants than in the isogenic amgR + strains grown at the permissive temperature of 30 °C ( Fig. 4E ; note that the AmgR - promoted decrease in mgtC mRNA required a longer incubation at 30 °C ) , reinforcing the notion that the RNase E - dependent degradation of the mgtC mRNA requires AmgR .
The lower MgtC protein levels resulting from AmgR - promoted destabilization of the mgtC mRNA is RNase III - independent because it was still observed in an rnc mutant ( Fig .
Likewise , AmgR retained the ability to reduce MgtC protein levels in an hfq mutant ( Fig .
S6C ) , lacking the RNA chaperone that is essential for the activity of many trans - acting sRNAs ( Chen et al. , 2004 , Katayama et al. , 2005 , Storz et al. , 2005 , Wagner & Flardh , 2002 , Waters & Storz , 2009 ) .
Cumulatively , these data indicate that the AmgR - dependent decrease in mgtC mRNA levels requires RNase E but neither RNase III nor Hfq .

Lee and Groisman Page 6 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Differential PhoP binding to the amgR and mgtCBR promoters The PhoP protein typically binds to an hexanucleotide direct repeat separated by five nucleotides -- designated PhoP box -- present in the promoters of its regulated targets ( Zwir et al. , 2005 ) .
Analysis of the amgR promoter region revealed the presence of a sequence resembling one half of a PhoP box ( Fig. 1B ) .
This raised the possibility that PhoP may regulate amgR transcription directly ; and if that were to be the case , PhoP was likely to bind to the amgR promoter with less affinity than to the mgtC promoter , which has a complete PhoP box with excellent match to the PhoP box consensus sequence ( Zwir et al. , 2005 ) .
We first explored PhoP binding to the amgR and mgtC promoters in - vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation using a strain expressing the PhoP - HA protein from the normal phoP promoter and chromosomal location ( Shin & Groisman , 2005 ) .
PhoP occupied the mgtC promoter 2 h after Salmonella was switched from high to low Mg 2 + media ( Fig. 5A ) .
By contrast , PhoP binding to the amgR promoter took place only after 4 h ( Fig. 5B ) .
This appears to reflect that there was more phosphorylated PhoP protein at 4 h than at 2 h postinduction ( Fig .
Electrophoretic mobility - shift assays demonstrated that larger amounts of purified PhoP - His6 protein were necessary to shift a DNA fragment harboring the amgR promoter than one carrying the mgtC promoter ( Fig. 5C ) .
The observed shifts were specific to the mgtC and the amgR promoter regions because they could be competed out by the corresponding unlabeled DNA fragments but not by a non - specific competitor ( Fig. 5C ) .
Furthermore , a DNA fragment consisting of one half of the amgR promoter region could not be shifted by the same amount of PhoP - His6 protein ( data not shown ) .
These data demonstrated that the PhoP protein controls AmgR expression directly , and that it binds to the amgR promoter with less affinity than to the mgtC promoter .
AmgR regulates Salmonella virulence Because MgtC is required for virulence in mice ( Blanc - Potard & Groisman , 1997 ) and because AmgR reduces MgtC protein levels ( Fig. 3A ) , we reasoned that changes in AmgR expression might impinge on Salmonella 's pathogenicity .
To test this notion , we carried out two sets of experiments that probed the effect of obliterating or overexpressing AmgR .
Firstly , we inoculated mice intraperitoneally with ~ 10 3 of either wild - type Salmonella or the isogenic amgR promoter mutant and followed mouse survival for three weeks .
Only 40 % of the mice inoculated with the amgR promoter mutant survived compared to 80 % of those inoculated with wild - type Salmonella ( Fig. 6A ) .
Moreover , the mice inoculated with the amgR promoter mutant died 5 -- 7 days before those inoculated with the wild - type strain ( Fig. 6A ) .
And secondly , we inoculated mice intraperitoneally with ~ 2 × 10 4 of wild - type Salmonella harboring either the AmgR - expressing plasmid pBAD - amgR or the vector pBAD18 .
All the mice inoculated with the strain harboring pBAD - amgR survived whereas 100 % of the mice inoculated with the strain harboring the control plasmid vector died within 2 weeks ( Fig. 6B ) .
( We used a larger bacterial dose than in the previous experiment to better evaluate the protective effect of AmgR overexpression .
) These results showed that tight control of MgtC and/or MgtB protein levels by AmgR is critical for Salmonella virulence .
Different roles for AmgR and MgtR in controlling MgtC levels Both the MgtR peptide ( Alix & Blanc - Potard , 2008 ) and the AmgR RNA ( Fig. 3 ) function as negative regulators of MgtC .
However , they differ in two aspects : First , mgtR is cotranscribed with mgtC and mgtB whereas amgR is on a different transcription unit , suggesting that they act at different times after the onset of PhoP - inducing conditions .
And second , MgtR does not affect MgtB levels ( Alix & Blanc - Potard , 2008 ) whereas AmgR does Mol Microbiol .

NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Discussion We evaluated the MgtC and MgtB protein levels in four isogenic strains differing in whether they have functional or null alleles of mgtR and amgR .
The amgR promoter mutant had higher MgtC protein levels than the wild - type strain following 5 h growth under PhoPinducing conditions ( Fig. 6C ) ; yet , this effect was no longer apparent after 23 h ( Fig. 6C ) .
By contrast , the mgtR mutant accumulated larger MgtC amounts both at 5 and 23 h in wildtype and amgR backgrounds ( Fig. 6C ) .
As expected , accumulation of the MgtC protein in the amgR mgtR double mutant resembled that taking place in the mgtR mutant ( Fig. 6C ) .
To compare the virulence contribution of MgtR and AmgR , we determined the survival of C3H/HeN mice when inoculated intraperitoneally with ~ 3 × 10 3 of the four isogenic strains described above .
All the animals that were infected with the Salmonella amgR promoter mutant perished within the first 16 days whereas 40 % of those injected with the mgtR mutant survived , displaying a similar survival as those that were inoculated with wild - type Salmonella or the mgtR amgR double mutant ( Fig. 6D ) .
Most examined organisms produce non - coding regulatory RNAs ( Chen et al. , 2004 , Katayama et al. , 2005 , Storz et al. , 2005 , Wagner & Flardh , 2002 , Waters & Storz , 2009 ) .
In bacteria , these RNAs can be divided into two groups based on whether they are encoded in cis or trans with respect to the target mRNA they regulate ( Wagner & Flardh , 2002 ) .
Until very recently , the typical cis - acting RNA was small , encoded in a plasmid , transposon or bacteriophage genome , exhibited perfect complementarity with its target and did not require the RNA chaperone Hfq to exert its regulatory action ( Brantl , 2007 ) .
This is in contrast to trans - acting RNAs , which tend to be longer , chromosomally - encoded , display only partial complementarity with their targets , and are dependent on Hfq ( Storz et al. , 2005 ) .
However , genome - wide transcriptomic analyses now indicate that bacteria make large numbers of cisacting anti - sense RNAs ( Liu et al. , 2009 , Mendoza - Vargas et al. , 2009 , Sharma et al. , 2010 , Toledo - Arana et al. , 2009 ) the properties of which remain largely unknown .
We have now uncovered a cis - encoded anti - sense RNA -- termed AmgR -- with three salient properties : ( 1 ) it is unusually long ; ( 2 ) it functions to attenuate virulence mediated by the sense - encoded MgtC protein ; and ( 3 ) its expression is under direct control of the PhoP protein , which is essential for transcription of the sense RNA that it regulates .
The 1,200 - nt long AmgR is slightly longer that the 1000 - nt long antisense RNA identified in Clostridium acetobutylicum ( Andre et al. , 2008 ) and a 750 - nt antisense RNA reported in Bacillus subtilis ( Eiamphungporn & Helmann , 2009 ) .
The length of the AmgR suggests that it has the potential for complementarity with the mgtC coding region as well as with the leader region of the mgtCBR transcript , extending even to the PhoP - dependent mgtC promoter ( Fig. 1A ) .
This is in contrast to the well - characterized antitoxin RNAs , which typically overlap only with the 5 ' or 3 ' ends of toxin - encoding mRNAs ( Fozo et al. , 2008 ) .
The amgR promoter is located in the intergenic region that separates the mgtC and mgtB genes , raising the possibility of other cis - acting RNAs being encoded within operons as recently suggested for H. pyroli ( Sharma et al. , 2010 ) , V. cholerae ( Liu et al. , 2009 ) and L. monocytogenes ( Toledo - Arana et al. , 2009 ) .
Thus , the repertoire of bacterial regulatory RNAs is likely to be larger than anticipated because most genome - wide efforts to identify regulatory RNAs have typically focused on regions located between ( as opposed to within ) transcription units ( Altuvia , 2007 , Vogel & Sharma , 2005 ) .
Yet , long intergenic regions located within operons may not necessarily code for regulatory RNAs but rather be the Mol Microbiol .

Antisense RNAs affecting expression within an operon have been described for the Spot42 RNA in the galETKM operon of E. coli ( Moller et al. , 2002 ) , the RNAβ regulatory RNA of the iron transport/biosynthesis operon of Vibrio anguillarum ( Stork et al. , 2007 ) and the GlmZ sRNA targeting the glmUS operon involved in amino - sugar metabolism of E. coli ( Urban & Vogel , 2008 ) .
Spot42 binds to the galK ribosome binding sequence , which unlike the mRNA destabilization promoted by AmgR , it leads to translational repression of galK without affecting expression of the two upstream genes galE and galT ( Moller et al. , 2002 ) .
Similarly , RNAβ is transcribed within the iron uptake - biosynthesis operon ( fatDCBA angRT ) of the virulence plasmid pJM1 , causing differential expression between the fatDCBA genes encoding the ferric - siderophore transport proteins and the angRT genes encoding the siderophore biosynthesis proteins ( Stork et al. , 2007 ) .
In contrast to the Spot42 and RNAβ RNAs , the GlmY and GlmZ sRNAs act hierarchically on the activation of GlmS synthesis at a post - transcriptional level without affecting GlmU protein levels ( Urban & Vogel , 2008 ) .
AmgR appears to act as a timing device that allows Salmonella to modify the levels of the MgtC and MgtB proteins dynamically when Salmonella experiences PhoP inducing conditions ( Fig. 3 and Fig. 6C ) .
The AmgR effects are more dramatically observed on MgtC and this could obey the multiple biochemical functions and/or physiological roles ascribed to MgtC , which enables growth in low Mg 2 + , mediates Salmonella survival inside macrophages and is necessary for Salmonella 's ability to cause a lethal infection in mice ( Blanc - Potard & Groisman , 1997 ) .
Thus , it is possible that different amounts of MgtC may be needed for the pathogenicity and Mg 2 + homeostasis activities , which have been separated genetically ( Rang et al. , 2007 ) , and that AmgR functions to limit MgtC levels under particular circumstances , which would be determined by the degree of activation of PhoP protein .
The role played by AmgR is different from that carried out by the MgtR peptide , which sets the steady - state MgtC : MgtB ratio ( Alix & Blanc - Potard , 2008 ) , because : First , even though inactivation of either mgtR or the amgR promoter results in higher MgtC protein levels , the MgtR effect is observed both at 5 h and 23 h after switching bacteria to low Mg 2 + media ( Alix & Blanc - Potard , 2008 ) ( Fig. 6C ) but AmgR plays its major role at 5 h ( Fig. 3A and Fig. 6C ) .
And second , the amgR promoter mutant is hypervirulent ( Fig. 6A and 6D ) whereas the mgtR mutant retains the pathogenic behavior of the wild - type strain ( Fig. 6D ) ( Alix & Blanc - Potard , 2008 ) .
Pathogenic bacteria must control the expression of its virulence determinants tightly as overexpression of particular proteins or constitutive alleles of particular genes can compromise a pathogen 's ability to survive within its host rendering the bacterium as attenuated as mutants lacking the gene ( Humphreys et al. , 2004 , Miller & Mekalanos , 1990 , Mouslim et al. , 2004 ) .
It is also the case that certain virulence proteins must be expressed for a defined extent of time .
For example , the Salmonella effector SptP reverses the cytoskeletal rearrangements promoted by a different Salmonella effector -- termed SopE -- taking place during eukaryotic cell invasion ( Kubori & Galan , 2003 ) , possibly to preserve the integrity of Salmonella 's replication habitat ( Galan & Zhou , 2000 ) .
Our experiments now indicate that the amount of MgtC protein is a limiting factor in Salmonella 's pathogenic capacity as the amgR promoter mutation , which enhances MgtC and MgtB levels ( Fig. 3A ) , rendered Salmonella more virulent than the wild - type strain ( Fig. 6A and 6D ) .
( By contrast , AmgR overexpression decreased MgtC protein levels ( Fig .
S4A ) and attenuated Salmonella Mol Microbiol .

) Thus , Salmonella uses the AmgR antisense RNA to limit proliferation in host tissues , perhaps because mgtC contributes to long - term infection in mice ( Lawley et al. , 2006 ) .
AmgR promotes changes in MgtC protein levels ( Fig. 3A ) by destabilizing the mgtC portion of the polycistronic mgtCBR mRNA ( Fig. 4A ) in an RNase E - dependent ( Fig. 4D ) but MgtR - , RNase III - and Hfq - independent fashion ( Fig .
The Hfq - independent action of AmgR is typical of cis - acting anti - sense RNAs ( Brantl , 2007 ) .
Both AmgR and mgtCBR are expressed when Salmonella experiences low Mg 2 + ( Fig. 2 ) ( Snavely et al. , 1991 , Soncini et al. , 1996 ) by the direct transcriptional control of the PhoP protein ( Fig. 2 and Fig. 5 ) .
This is in contrast to most sRNAs described to date , the expression of which is typically regulated by a different regulator than the mRNA they target .
Yet , it does not appear to be unique as the recently described anti - sense RNAs for acid resistance genes in H. pylori are also induced by acid stress ( Sharma et al. , 2010 ) .
The observed kinetic changes in MgtC and MgtB protein levels ( Fig. 3A ) probably reflect the different affinity of the PhoP protein for the amgR and mgtCBR promoters ( Fig. 5C ) , which result in distinct promoter occupancies in - vivo ( Fig. 5A and 5B ) .
Our findings raise the possibility of PhoP - P binding to the amgR promoter hindering transcriptional activation of the mgtC promoter , perhaps by forming a loop with PhoP - P at the mgtC promoter .
Analysis of the mgtC - mgtB intergenic region indicates that the amgR promoter and putative PhoP box sequences are conserved among salmonellae serovars differing in host specificity and disease they provoke ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , the mgtC and mgtB genes are separated by unusually long sequences also in Yersinia spp ( 300 -- 408 bp ) and in Erwinia tasmaniensis ( 295 bp ) ( Fig .
In the case of Yersinia spp , we could identify a conserved promoter region and a putative PhoP box sequence , raising the possibility of an AmgR - like RNA operating also in this enteric pathogen where the mgtC gene is also required for virulence ( Grabenstein et al. , 2006 ) .
By contrast , a TBLASTn search of the Enterobacteriaceae family genomes with the MgtR amino - acid sequence did not result in a positive hit .
Yet , downstream of the E. tasmaniensis mgtB gene is an open reading frame potentially coding for a highly hydrophobic 30 - amino - acid long peptide , like the Salmonella MgtR peptide with which it shares six amino - acids .
Finally , the PhoP/PhoQ two - component regulatory system governs virulence and Mg 2 + homeostasis both directly , by the PhoP protein binding to its target promoters ( Zwir et al. , 2005 ) as well as indirectly , by promoting the expression of proteins that modify the levels ( Bijlsma & Groisman , 2005 , Shi et al. , 2004 ) and/or activity of transcriptional regulators ( Bijlsma & Groisman , 2005 , Kato & Groisman , 2004 ) and alternative sigma factors ( Bougdour et al. , 2008 , Tu et al. , 2006 ) .
It is now becoming clear that PhoP exerts its regulatory control also by inducing the production of trans - acting ( Moon & Gottesman , 2009 ) and cis - encoded ( this work ) regulatory RNAs .

Lee and Groisman Page 10 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript DH5α was used as the host for preparation of plasmid DNA .
Ampicillin and kanamycin were used at 50 µg ml − 1 , chloramphenicol was used at 20 µg ml − 1 , tetracycline at 10 µg ml − 1 and fusaric acid at 12 µg ml − 1 .
Construction of plasmid pBAD - amgR A 1,372 bp of EcoRI - HindIII fragment corresponding to the complete 1,224 bp AmgR sequence and 148 bp downstream of AmgR was amplified using genomic DNA from strain 14028s and primers 7611 and 7613 , and then ligated into plasmid pBAD18 that had been digested with EcoRI and HindIII to generate pBAD - amgR .
DNA sequencing verified the presence of wild - type amgR sequence in the pBAD - amgR plasmid .
Construction of a chromosomal mutant with nucleotide substitutions in the amgR and mgtC promoter To create the amgR and mgtC promoter mutants , we introduced a Tet r cassette in the mgtCmgtB intergenic region and the mgtC promoter region , respectively , as follows : we generated a 1,990 - bp PCR product harboring the tetRA genes using as template chromosomal DNA from strain MS7953s and primers 7802/7803 ( for amgR ) and 7370/7371 ( for p mgtC - ) , which apart from the region of complementarity with the tetRA sequences they were flanked by 40 - bp sequences exhibiting identity to the mgtC - mgtB intergenic region and the mgtC promoter region .
The product was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit ( QIAGEN ) and used to electroporate Salmonella 14028s containing plasmid pKD46 ( Datsenko & Wanner , 2000 ) .
The resulting mgtCB ∷ tetRA and p mgtC ∷ tetRA strains containing plasmid pKD46 ( EG18750 and EG17156 ) were kept at 30 °C .
Then , we replaced the tetRA cassette in the mgtC - mgtB intergenic region and mgtC promoter region to create the amgR and mgtC promoter mutations .
This was accomplished by preparing a DNA fragment harboring nucleotide substitutions in the amgR promoter − 10 sequence and PhoP box in the mgtC promoter by a two - step PCR process .
For the first PCR reaction , we used primer pairs 7554/7860 and 7859/1259 for the amgR promoter , and 3552/1689 and 1690/3553 for the mgtC promoter .
For the second PCR reaction , we mixed the two PCR products from the first reaction as templates and amplified the DNA fragment using primers 7554/1259 ( amgR promoter ) and 3552/3553 ( mgtC promoter ) .
The PCR product was purified , electroporated into EG18750 and EG17516 respectively and plated on media containing fusaric acid to select against the tetRA genes ( Maloy & Nunn , 1981 ) , and incubated at 37 °C .
The transformants were further purified on fusaric acid - containing plates and screened for their ability to grow in the presence of tetracycline and ampicillin .
Those tetracycline - and ampicillin - sensitive colonies were further investigated for the presence of nucleotide substitution in the amgR promoter and mgtC promoter region by sequencing a PCR product generated with primers 7554/1259 and 3552/3553 respectively .
In the mgtC promoter mutant nucleotides CTTAAACAGA were substituted for nucleotides CTGGATCCGA .
The nucleotide changes in the amgR promoter mutant are indicated in Figure 1B .
Construction of strains with chromosomal deletions of the hfq , mgtR and rnc genes Salmonella strains deleted for the hfq , mgtR or rnc genes were constructed by the one - step gene inactivation method ( Datsenko & Wanner , 2000 ) .
The Cm R cassette from plasmid pKD3 was amplified using primers 4718 and 4719 , 10009 and 10010 , and 2991 and 2993 to make the hfq , mgtR and rnc mutants , respectively .
The resulting PCR product were integrated into the chromosome of strain 14028s to create strains EG15349 ( hfq ∷ Cm R ) and EG15350 ( rnc ∷ Cm R ) .
P22 phage lysates grown in strains EG15349 and EG15350 were used to transduce wild - type 14028s and amgR promoter mutant ( EG18729 ) Salmonella selecting for chloramphenicol resistance to generate strains EL58 ( hfq ∷ Cm R ) , EL59 ( amgR , hfq ∷ Cm R ) , EL60 ( rnc ∷ Cm R ) and EL61 ( amgR , rnc ∷ Cm R ) , respectively .

Regulation of the mgtCBR operon A .
When the sensor PhoQ senses low extracytoplasmic Mg 2 + , it promotes phosphorylation of the PhoP protein .
Phosphorylated PhoP ( PhoP - P ) binds to the mgtC promoter resulting in transcription of the mgtCBR message , and to the amgR promoter to generate a 1.2 kbantisense RNA that destabilizes the sense mRNA resulting in lower levels of the MgtC and MgtB proteins .
The 30 - amino - acid long MgtR peptide binds to the MgtC protein leading to MgtC degradation by the FtsH protease .
Grey arrows correspond to open reading frames ( which are not drawn to scale ) .
