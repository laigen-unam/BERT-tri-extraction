We demonstrate that , in Salmonella enterica , Rob overexpression upregulates the transcription of mgtA , which codes for the MgtA Mg 2 transporter .
mgtA was previously characterized as a member of the Mg 2 - modulated PhoPQ regulon .
Here we demonstrate that Rob ( but not its paralog protein SoxS or MarA ) is able to induce mgtA transcription in a PhoP - independent fashion by binding to a conserved Mar/Sox/Rob motif localized downstream of the PhoP - box and overlapping the PhoP - dependent transcriptional start site .
We found that Rob - induced mgtA expression confers low - level cyclohexane resistance on Salmonella .
Because mgtA intactness is required for Rob - induced cyclohexane resistance , provided the AcrAB multidrug efflux pump can be expressed , we postulate that MgtA is involved in the AcrAB - mediated cyclohexane detoxification mechanism promoted by Rob in Salmonella .
The Rob protein is a member of a subfamily of AraC/XylS transcriptional regulators which also includes MarA , SoxS , and TetD , a more recently described protein ( 14 , 27 ) .
Although all of the proteins in this subfamily recognize the same asymmetric degenerate binding motif known as the Mar/Sox/Rob box , they are able to differentially induce each individual promoter , depending on the activator concentration ( 24 ) and the relative affinity that each regulator has for each operator region ( 26 , 27 ) .
It has been demonstrated that MarA , SoxS , and Rob are able to promote low - level resistance to multiple drugs , heavy metals , and superoxide and also to induce organic solvent tolerance in Escherichia coli .
In contrast to what has been described for SoxS or MarA , the intracellular levels of Rob do not appear to be subject to extensive variations under most of the conditions tested , although a moderate increase has been observed in stationary - phase or in phosphate - or glucose - restricted medium ( 17 ) .
In E. coli , it was demonstrated that Rob inducers such as dipyridyl , bile - salts , or fatty - acids trigger its activity by provoking a conformational switch in the regulator ( 37 , 38 ) .
This activation can also be achieved in - vitro or in - vivo by overexpressing either the N - terminal portion ( which harbors the DNA - binding domain ) or the full - length protein ( 3 , 16 , 32 ) .
While searching for factors that would modulate the expression of Salmonella mgtA independently of the PhoP / PhoQ system , we identified Rob .
We found that Rob was able to induce mgtA transcription by a direct interaction Molecular y Celular de Rosario ( IBR - CONICET ) , Departamento de Microbiología , Facultad de Ciencias Bioquímicas y Farmacéuticas ( UNR ) Suipacha 531 , S2002LRK Rosario , Argentina .

mgtA codes for a P - type ATPase which is known as one of the three Mg 2 transporters in Salmonella enterica , together with MgtB and CorA ( see reference 19 for a comprehensive review ) .
It has been previously demonstrated that mgtA expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the extracellular Mg 2 - responsive PhoP / PhoQ two - component system ( 13 , 39 ) and posttranscriptionally by an intracellular Mg 2 - sensitive riboswitch that governs the extent of transcript elongation and stability ( 9 , 40 ) .
Several lines of evidence have converged to suggest that MgtA plays an essential role in maintaining Salmonella Mg 2 homeostasis .
mgtA is required for normal cell growth in Mg 2 - restricted minimal liquid medium ( 39 ) .
Additionally , mgtA transcription is differentially and more sensitively regulated in response to environmental Mg 2 availability compared to other PhoP - regulated genes , with its promoter displaying a higher affinity for the PhoP regulator ( 31 , 40 ) .
The fine and multilevel regulation of mgtA expression is indicative of MgtA relevance in the physiology of the cell .
In this work , we show that the mgtA regulatory region also harbors a Mar/Sox/Rob box downstream the PhoP recognition motif and that its expression is selectively induced by Rob and not modulated by MarA or SoxS .
We demonstrate that basal Rob levels contribute to MgtA expression in late exponential phase and show that Rob overexpression confers enhanced resistance to cyclohexane on Salmonella .
We also provide evidence that mgtA expression is involved in this solvent resistance phenotype , disclosing a novel role for MgtA in Salmonella .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains , plasmids , and growth - conditions .
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Bacteria were grown in Miller 's Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium or on LB agar plates overnight at 37 °C .
The antibiotics used were ampicillin ( 100 g ml 1 ) , kanamycin ( 50 g ml 1 ) , and chlor - 4951 4952 BARCHIESI ET AL. .
All of the reagents , chemicals , and oligonucleotides used were from Sigma .
For the - galactosidase activity assay , bacteria were grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C in LB - medium with the addition of different concentrations of isopropyl - - D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) , with and without 50 mM MgCl 2 , as indicated .
- Galactosidase levels were determined as described previously ( 30 ) .
Genetic and molecular biology techniques .
Gene disruptions or lacZ reporter fusions were carried out as described previously ( 10 ) in strain LB5010 ( 4 ) .
All constructions were transferred to wild - type ( WT ) strain 14028s by P22 transduction ( 11 ) .
When necessary , the antibiotic resistance cassette inserted at the deletion point was removed by using temperature - sensitive plasmid pCP20 carrying the FLP recombinase ( 8 ) .
The marA soxS double mutant was generated by transducing the soxS : : Cm r deletion into the marA mutant strain by phage P22 - mediated transduction .
pCE36 was used to introduce the transcriptional lacZ fusion as previously described ( 12 ) .
The same procedure was used to construct the marA soxS rob mutant strain .
All mutated DNA fragments were sequenced to confirm the required mutation and to screen against undesired mutations .
To construct plasmids pRob , pMarA , and pSoxS ( Table 1 ) , the rob , marA , and soxS genes were amplified from the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028s chromosome by PCR with primers rob BglII ( F ) and rob HindIII ( R ) for pRob , marA BglII ( F ) and marA HindIII ( R ) for pMarA , and soxS BglII ( F ) and soxS HindIII ( R ) for pSoxS ( Table 2 ) .
Each fragment obtained was cloned into BamHI - HindIII - digested pUHE21 - 2laqI q .
Plasmid DNA was introduced into bacterial strains by electroporation with a Bio - Rad apparatus according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
An adaptation of the method described by Horton et al. ( 15 ) was used to generate chromosomal deletions in the mgtA untranslated region ( UTR ) .
Briefly , a first round of PCR was carried out with the mgtA - tF oligonucleotide as the 5 primer with mgtA - 1 - 2A , mgtA - 1A , or mgtA - 2A and the mgtA - tR oligonucleotide as a 3 primer with mgtA - 1 - 2B , mgtA - 1B , or mgtA - 2B to generate the first 5 or 3 amplification product for UTR , UTR1 , or UTR2 , respectively .
A second round of amplification was performed with mgtA - tF and mgtA - tR and the 5 or 3 amplification product as the template .
The PCR products were purified , cloned into the pGEM - T ( Promega Corp. ) plasmid , and verified by DNA sequence analysis .
To introduce these mutations into the chromosome , a second round of overlap extension PCR was performed with a treB - F/TreR - R-amplified fragment containing a Cm r cassette from pKD3 and the mgtA - tF/mgtA - tR PCR products of the fragments cloned in pGEM - T .
The treB - F/mgtA - tR PCR fragments containing the mutated mgtA promoter sequence were introduced into the mgtA : : MudJ treBR phoP strain ( 40 ) .
All of the mutations were verified by chromosomal DNA sequence analysis .
All of the primer sequences used are provided in Table 2 .
RNA purification and primer - extension .
Total RNA was extracted from lateexponential - phase cultures ( optical density at 630 nm 0.9 ) grown in LB at 37 °C with 100 g ml 1 ampicillin and 0.1 mM IPTG as previously described ( 5 ) .
A final RNA cleanup step with an RNeasy kit ( Qiagen ) , used according to the manufacturer 's protocol , was included .
cDNA synthesis was performed with 1.0 pmol of 32 P - end - labeled primer MgtA Primext 2 , with 50 g of total RNA and 1 U of SuperScript II RNaseH2 reverse transcriptase ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) .
The extension products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6 % polyacrylamide -- 8.0 M urea gel and compared with sequence ladders initiated with the same 32 P - labeled primer that was used for primer - extension .
DNase I footprinting assay .
DNase - I-protection assays were done for both DNA strands with labeled primers mgtA - tF and # 384 mgtA2 .
Binding reaction mixtures with 0 or 132 nmol of purified Rob - HisX6 protein and 6.0 fmol of labeled DNA in a 20 - l volume were incubated at room temperature for 30 min .
Rob - HisX6 protein was purified by our previously described protocol ( 22 ) .
The binding buffer used for protein - DNA incubations contained 25 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 10 % glycerol , 2.0 ng l 1 salmon sperm DNA , and 0.025 mg ml 1 bovine serum albumin .

( 0.05 U ; Life Technologies , Inc. ) was added , and the mixture was incubated for 60 s at room temperature in a final volume of 100 l .
The reaction was stopped by adding 90 l of 20 mM EDTA ( pH 8.0 ) -- 200 mM NaCl -- 100 g ml 1 tRNA .
DNA fragments were purified by phenol - chloroform extraction and resuspended in 7.0 l ofH 2 O. Samples ( 3 l ) were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide ( 6 % ) gel electrophoresis by comparison with a DNA sequence ladder generated with the appropriate primer ( 1 ) .
A method termed the efficiency - of - plating assay was used to determine solvent tolerance ( 23 ) .
Briefly , stationary - phase LB broth cultures were diluted into the same medium to yield a suspension of approximately 10 4 cells ml 1 .
A 30 - l volume of the cell suspension was spread over the surface of a 20 - ml LB - agar plate containing 0.1 mM IPTG and ampicillin which was subsequently overlaid with 1 ml of cyclohexane or 2 ml of n - hexane .
The plates were sealed , and growth was assessed following incubation at 30 °C for 24 h .
We plotted the percent survival of each strain ( WT or otherwise isogenic mgtA , marA soxS , oracrAB mutant harboring the vector plasmid or the pRob plasmid ) grown in 20 ml LB - agar - ampicillin -- 0.1 mM IPTG plates with a 1 - ml cyclohexane or a 2 - ml n - hexane overlay , relative to the growth in plates without solvent , which was taken as 100 % .
Antibiotic and heavy metal susceptibility assays .
For antibiotic sensitivity assays , 50 l ofa2 10 2 dilution of overnight cultures was mixed with 50 l of antibiotic solution dissolved in the same medium at final concentrations that ranged between 0 and 15 g ml 1 for kanamycin , 0 and 3.0 g ml 1 for tetracycline , 0 and 0.6 g ml 1 for ciprofloxacin , and 0 and 45 g ml 1 for nalidixic - acid .
The mixtures were incubated in 96 - well microtiter plate at 37 °C with shaking for 18 h. Optical density at 630 nm was determined with a Dynatech Laboratories microplate reader .
For metal sensitivity assays , a 5 10 7 dilution of overnight culture of the strains was done in phosphate - buffered saline .
A 30 - l aliquot was applied to LB plates containing increasing concentrations of CdCl 2 , AgNO 3 , or HgCl 2 .
Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Alter incubation , the number of CFU per milliliter was calculated and percent survival was estimated on the basis of the count of the corresponding strain grown in the absence of added metal ( 7 ) .
Statistical analysis was performed by one - way analysis of variance and the Holm - Sidak test .
RESULTS mgtA expression is specifically upregulated by Rob in a PhoP - independent manner .
We have previously observed that , when expressing PhoP from multicopy plasmid pBP1019 , the induction of the PhoP - controlled gene expression turns out to be PhoQ and extracellular Mg 2 concentration independent ( 22 ) , with the exception of mgtCB and mgtA ( 40 ) .
This observation coincided with other reported results ( 9 , 42 ) .
With the aim of identifying regulatory factors other than the PhoP / PhoQ system or the posttranscriptional riboswitch controlling mgtA expression ( 9 ) , we transformed an mgtA : : MudJ phoP mutant Salmonella strain ( 39 ) with a partially Sau3AI - digested Salmonella phoPQ DNA chromosomal library generated in plasmid pBBR1 - MCS2 ( 20 ) .
Transformants were selected in 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - - D - galactopyranoside ( X - Gal ) -- LB - agar plates .
Out of approximately 5,000 transformants , we isolated one positive blue clone for the induction of mgtA expression .
DNA sequence analysis and a subsequent search of the Salmonella genome database ( 29 ) showed that the insert harbored the entire rob gene sequence and approximately 1,000 - bp flanking sequences upstream and downstream of rob .
The rob gene codes for Rob , a transcriptional regulator member of the AraC/XylS family of proteins that also includes MarA and SoxS .
To verify that Rob expression was responsible for mgtA induction , we PCR amplified and cloned rob into medium - copy plasmid pUHE21 - 2lacI q ( 39 ) under the control of the IPTGinducible promoter .
We determined mgtA transcriptional activities in the Salmonella WT and phoP mutant backgrounds .

Nevertheless , an eightfold decrease in mgtA transcription , presumably Two products were detected in the WT strain ( Fig. 3A ) .

On the other hand , only when cells were residue located 264 bp upstream of the mgtA start codon , grown to late exponential phase was a 30 % reduction in mgtA which coincides with the PhoP - dependent transcription start expression consistently observed in the rob mutant compared site previously identified in both S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and E. coli ( 18 , 21 , 39 ) .

This shorter product was detected either Mar/Sox/Rob box ( 28 ) .

start ATG site ( see reference 40 and Materials and Methods for details ) .
As shown in Fig. 3B , Rob - dependent induction of mgtA transcription was detected in the UTR2 deletion - containing strain , irrespective of the Mg 2 concentration used , while it was abrogated in the strains harboring the UTR and UTR1 deletions .
This result indicates that the region required for Rob - dependent regulation is at least partially encompassed in the region between nt 121 and nt 260 relative to the mgtA translational start codon ( see Fig. 4C for a scheme including the UTR deletions used ) .
To define whether Rob directly controls the expression of mgtA , a DNase I footprinting assay was performed with purified Rob as a His 6 - tagged protein , as described in Materials and Methods .
As shown in Fig. 4B , Rob protected an overlapping region from nt 28 to nt 53 relative to the Rob - dependent transcriptional start site .
The C residue at position 34 in the direct strand and the corresponding G residue at position 34 in the reverse strand showed hypersensitivity to DNase I .
The protected region ( Fig. 4A ) encompassed a sequence that displays a 15 - of - 20 match to the AHRGCACRWWNNRYYA AAHN Mar/Sox/Rob revised consensus binding motif ( 28 ) .
These results demonstrate the presence of a Mar/Sox/Rob binding motif in the 28 to 53 protected region of this promoter relative to the start site of the Rob - dependent transcript , providing evidence of a direct interaction of Rob within the mgtA promoter ( see schemes in Fig. 4B and C depicting the locations of the regulatory regions determined in the mgtA promoter region ) .
Rob - induced mgtA expression confers resistance to cyclohexane on Salmonella .
It has been previously demonstrated that overexpression of Rob confers multidrug , heavy metal , and organic solvent resistance on E. coli ( 3 , 16 , 32 , 43 ) .
To gain an insight into the physiological role of the Rob - dependent induction of mgtA in Salmonella , we compared the resistances of the WT and mgtA mutant strains to diverse compounds in the absence or presence of overexpressed Rob .
Antibiotic and metal resistances were determined by MIC assays , while resistance to organic solvents was assayed by the efficiency - ofplating method as previously described ( 23 , 43 ) .
We found that Rob overexpression did not affect WT Salmonella resistance to kanamycin , while it conferred augmented resistance to tetracycline , ciprofloxacin , and nalidixic - acid ( Table 3 ) .
No differential effects were observed in heavy metal resistance ( Ag , Cd , and Hg ; data not shown ) , while increased tolerance was detected when the cells were challenged with n - hexane and cyclohexane ( Table 3 and Fig. 5 ) .
The Rob - dependent induction of cyclohexane resistance was unaltered in a marA soxS mutant background .
The Rob - mediated cyclohexane resistance was approximately 10 - fold reduced in the mgtA strain compared to that of the WT strain ( Fig. 5 ) .
In contrast , mgtA deletion did not affect the Rob - mediated resistance to the other compounds tested .
It has been previously demonstrated that deletion of the multicomponent multidrug efflux pump - encoding operon acrAB results in loss of organic solvent tolerance ( 2 , 43 ) .
Therefore , we tested whether Rob - induced cyclohexane tolerance was detectable in an acrAB background .
Under our conditions , the resistance of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium to cyclohexane was abrogated in the acrAB mutant strain compared to the WT strain ( Fig. 5 ) .
This result suggests that mgtA expression contributes to acrAB - mediated cyclohexane resistance .
DISCUSSION Previous studies have provided ample demonstration that mgtA expression is subject to two different regulatory mechanisms in response to the availability of Mg 2 .
One is mediated by the phosphorylation status of the PhoP regulator , which modulates mgtA transcription in response to the kinase/phosphatase activity balance of the environmental Mg 2 - responsive sensor PhoQ ( 6 , 22 ) .
The other posttranscriptionally regulates the levels of the mgtA transcript , depending on the intracellular Mg 2 content ( 9 , 40 ) .
In this work , we show that the mgtA promoter region harbors a Mar/Sox/Rob motif which is responsive to Rob overexpression , not being significantly affected by overexpression of the MarA or SoxS paralogs .
Interestingly , the resultant Rob - dependent mgtA transcript is distinct and independent of that induced by the PhoP regulatory activity .
However , it preserves unmodified the 5 UTR , which is the target of the Mg 2 - dependent posttranslational regulatory mechanisms .

In contrast , in a phoP background , when the region required for the riboswitch is disrupted while preserving the Rob - binding site ( UTR2 strain ) , mgtA is induced by Rob in an Mg 2 - independent manner .
Neither Robmodulated expression nor a Mar/Sox/Rob conserved box in the respective regulatory region was detected in other PhoP - dependent genes examined ( including mgtCB ) , suggesting that this feature is unique to mgtA among the Salmonella PhoPQ VOL .

Predicted Rob - binding sites are located 250 , 398 , 249 , 249 , 255 , and 256 nt upstream of the mgtA translational start site , respectively .
Nucleotides that match the Mar/Sox/Rob consensus motif ( sequence at the top ) are in boldface .
Both the absence of a sequence matching the Mar/Sox/Rob motif in the promoter region of corA and - galactosidase activities measured from a strain harboring a corA : : lacZ transcriptional reporter in which Rob was overexpressed indicated that corA is not under Rob regulation ( our unpublished results ) .
Therefore , of the three Mg 2 transporters present in Salmonella , MgtA is the only one whose expression is subject to Rob - dependent regulation .
Upregulation of mgtA was only observed during Rob overexpression .
This was not unexpected , since most Rob - dependent phenotypes have been detected only when the regulator was overexpressed ( 3 , 32 , 43 ) .
Consistent with this result , when the rob mutant was compared to the otherwise WT strain in late exponential phase , downregulation of mgtA expression was observed , showing that , under this condition , physiological Rob levels contribute approximately 30 % of mgtA expression .
No mgtA induction was observed when testing compounds previously described to posttranslationally activate Rob in E. coli ( i.e. , salicylate , deoxycholate , and dipyridyl ) ( 37 , 38 ; data not shown ) .
In this regard , the E. coli and Salmonella Rob amino - acid sequences display 92 % identity .
However , they show only one nonidentical amino - acid along the N - terminal domain which harbors the 106 - residue DNA - binding region , while the 183 - amino - acid C - terminal domain that encompasses the putative regulatory domain which would bind the inducers shows 20 nonidentical residues .
Therefore , a dissimilar physiological function of Rob in E. coli or Salmonella might also explain why the inducers tested were ineffective in activating Salmonella Rob .
Interestingly , when the sequence that matches the Mar/Sox / Rob motif in the S. enterica mgtA promoter is compared to that region in other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae , an identical box can be found upstream of Citrobacter koseri mgtA .
E. coli , Shigella , Klebsiella , and Enterobacter strains show the Mar/Sox/Rob motif with a few scattered mismatches compared to the S. enterica Rob motif ( Fig. 6 ) .
This observation suggests that regulation of mgtA by Rob is an ancestral trait of related enterobacteria .
Because the overexpression of Rob was demonstrated to increase bacterial resistance to organic solvents , heavy metals , and antibiotics , we examined whether mgtA expression somehow contributes to the expression of these phenotypes .
Deletion of mgtA greatly diminishes Rob - mediated induction of Salmonella resistance to cyclohexane .
The induction of multidrug resistance and of organic solvent tolerance by the AraC / XylS - type regulators has been essentially associated with the abilities of these regulators to activate the expression of AcrAB , an RND family efflux pump which displays a broad drug specificity , and to simultaneously downregulate the expression of the major porin OmpF ( 36 , 41 ) .
As shown in Fig. 1B , Rob overexpression is able to upregulate acrAB transcriptional activity even in a marA soxS background .
On the other hand , the transcriptional activity of acrAB remained unchanged in an mgtA mutant strain compared to that in the otherwise isogenic WT strain ( not shown ) .
Traditionally , testing for cyclohexane resistance has been considered a quick and easy procedure to detect intrinsic fluoroquinolone resistance phenotypes in both E. coli and Salmonella isolates .
However , it seems that this association is valid only in those cases in which resistance is linked to active efflux mechanisms , mainly mediated by a high acrAB expression level .
But a cyclohexane tolerance assay is not appropriate when mutations in the gyrase or topoisomerase gene are the essential components of the fluoroquinolone resistance phenotype ( 25 , 33 , 35 , 36 ) .
Although we observed that , under our conditions , Rob - induced cyclohexane resistance was dependent on the intactness of acrAB , we did not find a concomitant Rob - enhanced mgtA - dependent resistance to fluoroquinolones ( i.e. , ciprofloxacin and nalidixic - acid ) .
In sum , these last results reveal that mgtA contributes to the mechanism of Rob - mediated resistance to cyclohexane in Salmonella , most probably because of its role in preserving Mg 2 homeostasis when the cation is scarce .
In light of our results , we favor the possibility that , under certain environmental conditions , mgtA might contribute to the acrAB - dependent solvent efflux mechanism .
Lastly , the multilevel regulation mechanisms that converge to control mgtA expression , comprising posttranscriptional and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms ( i.e. , PhoPQ , attenuation , degradation by RNase E , and Rob regulation ) , are indicative of a requirement for MgtA expression in Salmonella under precise physiological conditions .
