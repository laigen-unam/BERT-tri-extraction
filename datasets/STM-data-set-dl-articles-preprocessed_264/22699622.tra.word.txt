Control of a Salmonella Virulence Locus by an ATP - Sensing Leader mRNA Eun - Jin Lee 1 and Eduardo A. Groisman 1 , * 1 Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Yale School of Medicine , Section of Microbial Pathogenesis , Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine , 295 Congress Avenue , New Haven , CT 06536 - 0812 , USA ; Yale Microbial Diversity Institute , PO Box 27389 , West Haven , CT 06516 , USA Abstract The facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica resides within a membrane - bound compartment inside macrophages 1 .
This compartment must be acidified for Salmonella to survive within macrophages 2 , possibly because acid - pH promotes expression of Salmonella virulence proteins 3,4 .
We reasoned that Salmonella may sense its surroundings have turned acidic not only upon protonation of the extracytoplasmic domain of a protein sensor 5 but also by an increase in cytosolic ATP levels because conditions that enhance the proton gradient across the bacterial inner membrane stimulate ATP synthesis 6,7 .
We now report that an increase in cytosolic ATP promotes transcription of the coding region for the virulence gene mgtC , which is the most highly - induced horizontally - acquired gene when Salmonella is inside macrophages 8 .
This transcript was induced both upon media acidification as well as by physiological conditions that increase ATP levels independently of acidification .
ATP is sensed via the coupling/uncoupling of transcription of the unusually long mgtC leader mRNA and translation of a short open reading frame located in this region .
A mutation in the mgtC leader mRNA that eliminated the response to ATP hindered mgtC expression inside macrophages and attenuated Salmonella virulence in mice .
Our results define a singular example of an ATP - sensing leader mRNA .
Moreover , they indicate that pathogens can interpret extracellular cues by the impact they have on cellular metabolites .
The mgtC gene is required for survival inside macrophages and for growth in low Mg 2 + media in several phylogenetically unrelated intracellular pathogens including S. enterica 9 , Yersinia pestis 10 , Brucella suis 11 , Burkholderia cenocepacia 12 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis 13 .
In Salmonella , mgtC heads the mgtCBR operon , which specifies the inner membrane protein MgtC , the Mg 2 + transporter MgtB and the MgtR peptide promoting MgtC degradation 14 .
Transcription from the mgtCBR operon is controlled by the virulence regulatory system PhoP/PhoQ 15 .
mgtC expression must be tightly regulated for a normal course of infection because inactivation of the mgtC gene attenuates Salmonella virulence in mice 9 whereas preventing transcription of AmgR , a PhoP - dependent anti - sense RNA that promotes the preferential degradation of the mgtC portion of the polycistronic mgtCBR message , renders Salmonella hypervirulent 16 .
Mild acid - pH induces expression of the mgtC 17 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) and mgtB 18 genes in a phoP - dependent manner in wild - type Salmonella .
This could be ascribed to acid - pH sensing by PhoP 's cognate sensor PhoQ 5 .
However , Salmonella appears to utilize a different mechanism to promote mgtC expression in response to mild acid - pH because when bacteria * Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to E.A.G ( eduardo.groisman@yale.edu ) .

Lee and Groisman Page 2 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript were switched from media at pH 7.7 to media at pH 5.1 , the mRNA levels of the mgtC ( Fig. 1a ) and mgtB ( Fig. 1b ) coding regions increased even in a phoP * phoQ - strain , which lacks the pH sensor PhoQ and harbors a PhoP allele that can function in its absence 19 .
This stimulation appears to be specific to mgtC because the mRNA levels corresponding to the mgtA coding region did not increase ( Fig. 1c ) despite the mgtA promoter also being under direct transcriptional control of PhoP 15 .
The stimulation of mgtC expression promoted by mild acid - pH could be mediated by an increase in the proton gradient across the inner membrane , hence creating a change in cytosolic ATP .
Indeed , the intracellular pH dropped by ~ 0.9 units and the ATP concentration rose ~ 2.5 fold within one hour of switching the phoP * phoQ - strain from media at pH 7.7 to media at pH 5.1 ( Fig. 1d ) .
Dissipation of the proton gradient with a protonophore decreased ATP levels ( Fig. 1d ) and prevented induction of mgtC and mgtB at pH 5.1 ( Fig. 1a and 1b ) .
( A similar drop in intracellular pH was displayed by wild - type Salmonella displayed [ i.e. , from pH 8.15 ± 0.112 in media with pH 7.7 to pH 7.25 ± 0.079 in media with pH 5.1 and to pH 5.04 ± 0.031 in media with pH 5.1 in the presence of the protonophore ] .
) That cellular ATP is the signal upregulating mgtC transcription when Salmonella experiences mild acidification is supported by two additional experiments performed with strains carrying plasmid pGFP303 , which harbors the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the natural mgtCBR promoter and leader region fused to a promoterless gfp gene at the mgtC start codon .
Fluorescence was six fold higher when a purine auxotroph was grown in defined media with high adenine than with low adenine ( Fig. 2a ) .
The higher fluorescence is not due to differences in growth - rates ( data not shown ) or a decrease in cellular pH ( Fig. 2b ) , but reflects the higher ATP levels present in bacteria grown at the higher adenine concentration ( Fig. 2b ) .
Moreover , it is specific to ATP because a change in uridine levels in the growth media did not alter the fluorescence of a uridine auxotroph harboring pGFP303 ( data not shown ) .
Furthermore , it requires mgtCBR regulatory sequences because changes in the adenine concentration in the media did not affect the fluorescence produced by the adenine auxotroph harboring the plasmid vector ( Fig. 2a ) .
And when wild - type Salmonella harboring pGFP303 was grown in glucose , fluorescence was two times higher than when it was grown in glycerol ( Fig. 2c ) , reflecting the larger ATP amounts generated when glucose is used as carbon source ( Fig. 2d ) .
We analyzed the mgtCBR leader mRNA seeking sequence and structural features that may suggest how it might sense ATP .
We identified two short ORFs -- designated mgtM and mgtP -- preceded by putative ribosome binding sites ( RBS ) ( Fig. 4a ) .
Here , we focus on mgtM because , as described below , it mediates the response to ATP .
We determined that mgtM is translated in - vivo ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) and that similarly sized ORFs preceded by potential RBSs are conserved in the mgtCBR leader regions from other enteric bacteria ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) .
The sequences adjacent to and including mgtM have the potential to adopt two alternative structures -- stem - loops A and B -- in Salmonella ( Fig. 4a ) and other examined species ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) .
Inline probing experiments verified the formation of stem - loop B in the wild - type mgtCBR leader RNA ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ) and of stemloop A in a mutant leader RNA with the G 95 → C substitution , which is predicted to hinder formation of stem - loop B ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ) .
The deduced amino - acid sequence of mgtM is not conserved in other species ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ) , but its length and location relative to stem - loop A , as well as the presence of A nucleotides near the base and within stem - loop A are ( i.e. , positions 44 - 46 and 56 - 57 ; Fig. 4b ) .
Because the left arm of stem - loop A includes the last four mgtM codons ( Fig. 4a ) , translation of the complete mgtM is anticipated to hinder formation of stem - loop Nature .

Lee and Groisman Page 3 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript A and favor formation of stem - loop B. Therefore , changes in intracellular ATP levels may affect the coupling/uncoupling of transcription of the mgtCBR leader with translation of mgtM .
This would determine whether stem - loop A versus B forms thereby dictating whether transcription continues into the mgtCBR coding regions .
This is analogous to the mechanism by which cytoplasmic UTP levels control expression of the pyrimidine biosynthetic gene pyrBI in Escherichia coli , except that low UTP promotes pyrBI transcription when RNAP pauses at a U - rich segment of the pyrBI leader mRNA 20 whereas we propose that high ATP furthers expression of the mgtCBR coding regions .
In agreement with the notion that a transcription attenuation - like mechanism 20,21 regulates transcription elongation into the mgtCBR coding region , a strain with a chromosomal mutation in the mgtM start codon and harboring a lac fusion in the mgtC coding region produced over four times more β - galactosidase than the isogenic strain with the wild - type mgtC leader in response to low Mg 2 + ( Fig. 4c and 4d ) .
Likewise , strains harboring stop codons at the 4 th , 6 th or 7 th positions of mgtM ( Fig. 4a ) also derepressed mgtC - lac expression ( Fig. 4c ) .
This derepression is due to a defect in mgtM translation ( as opposed to resulting from an effect on the structure of the mgtC leader mRNA ) because a plasmid expressing the amber suppressor supF restored normal mgtC - lac transcription to an mgtM mutant with an amber stop codon at the 6 th position but not to an isogenic mutant with an ochre stop codon at the same position ( Fig. 4e ) .
As expected , the supF - expressing plasmid had no effect on mgtC - lac transcription in a strain harboring the wild - type mgtC leader ( Fig. 4e ) .
An mgtM derivative with a stop codon at the 9 th position failed to express mgtC - lac ( Fig. 4c ) , possibly because translation of mgtM beyond the 8 th codon would result in formation of stem - loop B ( Fig. 4a ) .
mgtM translation exerts its regulatory effect on the associated mgtCBR coding regions in cis ( as opposed to mgtM encoding a trans - acting peptide ) because a plasmid expressing the mgtM ORF failed to restore normal mgC - lac expression to an mgtM stop codon mutant , behaving like the vector control ( Fig. 4f ) ; and it had no effect on a strain with a wild - type mgtC leader ( Fig. 4f ) .
Our data suggest that whenever translation stops before the ribosome reaches the 9 th mgtM codon , stem - loop A forms , which promotes expression of the mgtCBR coding region ; and when mgtM is translated beyond a certain position , stem - loop B is favored , which reduces transcription of the mgtCBR coding region .
As predicted , the dramatic mgtC - lac derepression exhibited by the mgtM start codon mutant ( Fig. 4c and 4d ) was eliminated by the simultaneous introduction of C 87 → G and G 95 → C substitutions ( Fig. 4d ) , which further formation of stem - loop B ( Fig. 4a ) .
The phenotypes described above are not an artifact resulting from the absence of a fucntional mgtC gene in the mgtC - lac strains .
This is because mutation of the mgtM start codon derepressed mgtC levels in an otherwise wild - type Salmonella that experienced mild acidification ; and also because introduction of a stop codon at the 9 th position of mgtM resulted silenced mgtC expression in an isogenic strain subjected to the same conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ) ) .
The conserved A nucleotides at positions 44 - 46 or 56 - 57 of the mgtCBR leader ( Fig. 4a ) are critical for the response to ATP because : on the one hand , the mild acid induction of the mgtC and mgtB genes disappeared in a strain with a chromosomal mutation at position 44 - 46 in the mgtCBR leader ( Fig. 1a and 1b ) .
Likewise , growth in glucose no longer promoted higher fluorescence than growth in glycerol in wild - type Salmonella carrying a pGFP303 derivative with the As at position 44 - 46 substituted by Ts ( Fig. 2c ) .
And the increased fluorescence displayed by the mgtC mutant also required the A nucleotides at position 44 - 46 ( Fig. 2e ) .
Yet , this mutant leader retained a wild - type structure Nature .

Lee and Groisman Page 4 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Methods ( Supplementary Fig. 7 ) and ability to respond to Mg 2 + ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ) 22 .
Moreover , changes in the adenine concentration in the media failed to affect the fluorescence produced by the purine auxotroph with derivatives of pGFP303 where the A nucleotides at position 44 - 46 were replaced by either Ts , Gs or Cs , or with a plasmid with the A nucleotides at position 56 - 57 replaced by Gs ( to avoid destabilizing stem - loop A , the latter two nucleotides were not replaced by Ts or Cs ; Fig. 4a ) ( Fig. 2a ) .
One the other hand , an engineered mgtCBR leader with a scrambled mgtM sequence that retained the As at positions 44 - 46 and 56 - 57 displayed a wild - type response to ATP ( Fig. 2a ) .
The RNAs from the wild - type and ATP - blind mutant mgtC leader displayed indistinguishable in - vitro profiles when investigated at two pHs ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ) .
This provides further support to the notion that the increase in mgtCBR expression resulting from mild acidification is mediated by cytosolic ATP levels as opposed to protons being sensed directly by the mgtC leader mRNA .
Cumulatively , these data provide a singular example of a bacterial mRNA leader that senses ATP , utilizing a mechanism that is different from those previously described in eukaryotic organisms 23 - 25 .
We wondered whether ATP sensing by the mgtCBR mRNA leader is required for Salmonella virulence given that mgtC is expressed in a variety of tissues during infection in several different animal hosts 8,26 - 28 and that inactivation of the mgtC gene hinders survival inside macrophages and virulence in mice 9 .
We established that when Salmonella was inside the macrophage - like cell line J774.A1 , the mRNA levels of the mgtA and mgtC leaders region rose in parallel ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ) , which likely reflects activation of their respective promoters during infection 29 .
By contrast , the mRNA levels corresponding to the mgtC and mgtB coding regions increased dramatically ( i.e. , 10 fold by 9 h post internalization relative to Salmonella grown in tissue culture media ; Fig. 3d ) , but no induction was observed for the coding region of the mgtA gene ( Fig. 3d ) , which is not required for Salmonella virulence 9 .
This may reflect differences between the mgtCBR ( Fig. 4a ) and mgtA 30 leaders .
Indeed , the mRNA levels of the mgtA coding region did not increase under conditions promoting higher ATP levels ( Fig. 2a ) or mild acidification ( Fig. 1a ) .
Induction of the mgtC and mgtB coding regions inside macrophages requires the ability of the mgtCBR leader mRNA to sense ATP because it was defective in a chromosomal mutant with the A nucleotides at position 44 - 46 replaced by Ts ( Fig. 3e ) .
This mutant was attenuated for virulence following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice ( Fig. 3f ) , albeit not as much as a strain deleted for the mgtC and mgtB coding regions ( Fig. 3f ) , implying that other signaling inputs remain functional in this mutant .
Cumulatively , our findings demonstrate that the mgtCBR leader and the MgtC protein regulate ATP homeostasis by sensing and controlling cytosolic ATP levels , respectively .
These properties are critical for Salmonella virulence , possibly because Salmonella resides within a phagosome that is mildly acidic 1 , which is a condition that can generate high ATP levels in the bacterium 6,7 .
Finally , our data highlight how pathogens can interpret host - derived signals , such as acid - pH , by the changes they experience in their cellular constituents .

ATP promotes gene transcription in a manner dependent on conserved A nucleotides in the mgtCBR leader region a , Fold change in fluorescence produced by an adenine auxotroph ( EG9652 ) harboring the plasmid vector pfpv25 , pGFP303 or derivatives with substitutions of conserved A nucleotides at position 44 - 46 by Ts ( pGFP303 A 44 - 46 → T ) , Gs ( pGFP303 A 44 - 46 → G ) , or Cs ( pGFP303 A 44 - 46 → C ) , with substitutions of conserved 55 - 56 A nucleotides by Gs ( pGFP303 A 56 - 57 → G ) , or with substitution of most of the mgtM sequence except for A nucleotides at 44 - 46 and 55 - 56 ( pGFP303 mgtM scrambled ) .
Plasmid pfpv25mgtA harbors a transcriptional - fusion between the PhoP - dependent mgtA promoter and mgtA leader sequence and a promoterless gfp gene .
Bacteria were grown in N - minimal media with 10 μM Mg 2 + in the presence of either 25 μM ( low ) or 250 μM ( high ) adenine .
Fluorescence was monitored as described in Methods .
Fold change was calculated by dividing the fluorescence of cells grown in the high adenine by that of cells grown in low adenine .
Note that the ratio of fluorescence displayed at high and low adenine is the same for bacteria harboring pfpv25mgtA or the vector pfpv25 .
Data correspond to a representative of four independent experiments conducted in duplicate .

Regulation of the Salmonella mgtCBR virulence operon by the PhoP/PhoQ system and mgtCBR leader region a , The sensor PhoQ responds to extracytoplasmic low Mg 2 + , acid - pH and antimicrobial peptides by promoting phosphorylation of the PhoP protein , which binds to the mgtCBR promoter resulting in transcription initiation .
Acidic pH also produces a proton gradient across the inner membrane resulting higher intracellular ATP levels .
Intracellular ATP levels control transcription elongation into the mgtCBR coding regions by affecting the coupling/uncoupling of transcription of the mgtCBR leader and translation of the short ORF mgtM , which affects the formation of alternative stem - loops A versus B .
The mgtM RBS is underlined .
Positions and sequences of stop codon mutations or nucleotide substitutions in the strains used in the experiments presented in ( c ) and ( d ) are indicated and denoted below the mgtM sequence .
