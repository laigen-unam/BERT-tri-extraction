Crl has a major physiological impact at low levels of S .
Here , we report that the Crl effects on S - dependent gene expression , the H 2 O 2 resistance of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , and the resistance of this organism to acidic pH are greater at 28 °C than at 37 °C .
Immunoblot experiments revealed a negative correlation between S and Crl levels ; the production of Crl was slightly greater at 28 °C than at 37 °C , whereas the S levels were about twofold lower at 28 °C than at 37 °C .
At both temperatures , Crl was present in excess of S , and increasing the Crl level further did not increase the H 2 O 2 resistance level of Salmonella and the expression of the S - dependent gene katE encoding the stationaryphase catalase .
In contrast , increasing the S level rendered Salmonella more resistant to H 2 O 2 at 28 °C , increased the expression of katE , and reduced the magnitude of Crl activation .
In addition , the effect of Crl on katE transcription in - vitro was not dependent on temperature .
These results suggest that the effect of temperature on Crl - dependent regulation of the katE gene and H 2 O 2 resistance are mediated mainly via an effect on S levels .
In addition , our results revealed that S exerts a negative effect on the production of Crl in stationary - phase when the cells contain high levels of S .
Bacteria frequently encounter limited - nutrient conditions and are exposed to other stressful conditions in their natural habitats , causing them to grow and divide slowly and to enter stationary - phase .
Stationary - phase physiology , particularly multiple - stress resistance , and even cell morphology are determined by the general stress response .
This response is controlled at the molecular level by a sigma subunit of RNA polymerase , S ( for reviews , see references 12 and 14 ) .
In enterobacteria , RNA polymerase is composed of a core enzyme , E , with the subunit structure 2 , which associates with one of the seven different subunits to form the holoenzyme ( E ) .
Each subunit targets the RNA polymerase to a different set of promoters , thereby modulating the gene expression patterns .
The RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the 70 subunit is responsible for the transcription of most genes during exponential - growth .
When a cell enters stationary phase or when it is under specific stress conditions during the exponential - growth - phase ( high - osmolarity , low pH , or high and low - temperature ) , S , which is encoded by the rpoS gene , accumulates in the cell , associates with the core enzyme , and directs the transcription of genes essential for the general stress response and for stationary - phase survival ( for reviews , see references 12 and 14 ) .
Regulation of S occurs at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels and involves numerous regulators ( for a review , see reference 14 ) .

70 is abundant throughout the growth cycle and shows the highest affinity of all sigma factors for core polymerase in - vitro ( 12 ) .
In contrast , the level of S reaches only about one - third of the 70 level upon entry into stationary - phase and exhibits the lowest affinity for E of all sigma factors in - vitro ( 12 ) .
The cell uses at least two strategies to ensure the switch between 70 and S in the RNA polymerase and to allow reprogramming of gene expression during entry into stationary - phase .
Several factors ( Rsd , 6S RNA , ppGpp , and DksA ) indirectly increase S competitiveness upon entry into stationary - phase by decreasing 70 effectiveness ( for a review , see reference 14 ) .
In addition , increasing the performance of S involves the unconventional regulatory protein Crl .
The crl gene product is a regulator of S activity in Escherichia coli ( 1 , 8 , 19 , 30 ) and Salmonella ( 21 , 22 ) .
The Crl protein binds S in - vitro ( 1 ) and facilitates RNA polymerase holoenzyme E S formation ( 30 ) , thereby enhancing S effectiveness ( 8 , 21 , 22 , 30 ) .
The physiological effects of Crl are greatest at low levels of S ( 22 ) .
In addition to both transcriptomic and proteomic analyses , gene fusions experiments have indicated that members of the rpoS regulon exhibit differential sensitivity to Crl activation ( 6 , 16 , 22 , 30 ) .
Also in - vitro , the magnitude of Crl activation of gene transcription varies according to the promoter ( 8 , 22 ) .
In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028 , Crl is required for development of the rdar morphotype ( 21 ) , a colony morphology caused by production of curli and cellulose and correlated with biofilm formation ( 24 ) .
However , the crl mutation did not have any effect on the general stress resistance of ATCC 14028 unless S levels were reduced by using a derivative of ATCC 14028 in which rpoS had the inefficient translation start codon TTG ( 22 ) .
In this study , we showed that the effect of a crl mutation on the general stress resistance of ATCC 14028 is revealed upon 4453 4454 ROBBE - SAULE ET AL. .
We showed that the effects of Crl on the hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) resistance of ATCC 14028 and on gene transcription are greater at 28 °C than at 37 °C because S levels are lower at 28 °C than at 37 °C .
Upon entry into stationary - phase , Crl is more abundant than S , and S levels , but not Crl levels , are limiting for expression of S - dependent genes .
Finally , we underscored a feedback control of Crl effects ; in stationary phase , when the level of S is high and Crl may be dispensable , S exerts a negative effect on Crl production .
This control of Crl production by S , together with the negative control of S stability by Crl ( 19 , 30 ) , likely ensures tight control of , and a negative correlation between , S and Crl levels .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains , plasmids , and growth - conditions .
The S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Transposon Tn5B21 , a derivative of Tn5 that confers tetracycline resistance , was constructed to facilitate the creation of lacZ gene fusions ( 28 ) .
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 derivatives carrying Tn5B21 insertions in S - dependent genes have been described previously ( 11 , 22 ) .
Bacteriophage P22HT105/1int was used to transfer mutations between Salmonella strains by transduction ( 26 ) .
Green plates , for screening for P22 - infected cells or lysogens , were prepared as described previously ( 29 ) .
The plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Strains were routinely cultured at 37 °C in Luria - Bertani medium ( LB ) ( 25 ) .
Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations : carbenicillin , 100 gml 1 ; chloramphenicol , 15 g ml 1 for the chromosomal resistance gene and 30 g ml 1 for the plasmid resistance gene ; kanamycin , 50 g ml 1 ; and tetracycline , 20 g ml 1 .
For stress resistance assays , cells were grown to stationary - phase in LB at 37 and 28 °C ( optical density at 600 nm [ OD 600 ] , 3.5 to 4 ) .
For the oxidative shock survival assay , cells were washed and resuspended in 0.9 % NaCl to an OD 600 of 1.0 ( about 10 9 CFU per ml ) , and H 2 O 2 was added to a final concentration of 5 , 15 , or 30 mM , as indicated below .

Construction of the dps mutant and the chromosomal dps - lac fusion .
We created a chromosomal mutation in the dps gene of Salmonella ( strain ATCCdps ) ( Table 1 ) using PCR - generated linear DNA fragments and the Red recombination method as described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 5 ) .
We used primers dps - P1 ( 5 - CCTGGGACACAAACATCAAGAGGATATGAGATTAT GAGTACCGGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC - 3 ) and dps - P2 ( 5 - CTG CAACTCGAAGTATTCAGGGTAGAGATAGATTTATTCGATGCATATG AATATCCTCCTTAG - 3 ) for disruption of the dps gene .
Mutant candidates were characterized by using a combination of PCRs performed with locusspecific primers and common test primers ( 5 ) .
Finally , isogenic strains were constructed by P22HTint - mediated transduction of the mutations into the appropriate strains .
We constructed a single - copy dps - lacZY transcriptional gene fusion from mutant ATCCdps ( Table 1 ) using a conditional plasmid containing promoterless lacZY genes and the FLP recognition target ( FRT ) site as described previously ( 7 ) .
We then used PCR assays to ensure integration of the plasmid in the correct location and to determine the presence of multiple plasmid integrants ( using common test primers , such as those described by Ellermeier et al. [ 7 ] ) .
We also used flanking locus - specific primers to amplify junction fragments that were subsequently analyzed by DNA sequencing .
Isogenic strains were constructed by P22HTint - mediated transduction of the mutations into the appropriate strains .
Electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis of proteins .
Whole - cell extracts were prepared and sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Silhavy et al. ( 27 ) .
The amount of protein in whole - cell lysates was determined using a DC protein assay kit ( Bio - Rad ) .

Crl effect on expression of S - dependent genes at 28 and 37 °C .
A collection of lacZ - transcriptional - fusions in S - dependent genes was constructed in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028 and its crl derivative ATCCcrl ( 22 ) .
These fusions were initially isolated from a bank of Salmonella mutants harboring random Tn5B21 insertions ( 11 ) .
The S - dependent gene fusions ( 2.4 to G57 ) are labeled according to the names of the initial Tn5B21 mutants ( 11 ) .
The strains harboring the fusions were grown to stationary - phase in LB at 37 and 28 °C ( OD 600 , 3.5 to 4 ) , and - galactosidase activity was measured by using the method of Miller ( 17 ) .
The Crl effect is the ratio of the - galactosidase activity measured in the wild - type strain to that in the crl mutant .
RESULTS Greater effects of Crl on gene expression at 28 °C than at 37 °C .
We previously showed that a crl mutation does not have any effect on the general stress resistance of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 in LB at 37 °C ( 22 ) , but the development of the rdar morphotype in a crl mutant was affected ( 21 ) .
Development of the rdar morphotype is efficient at low temperature and osmolarity ( i.e. , at 28 °C in LB without salt [ LB0 ] ) .
To determine whether growth - conditions modulate Crl effects , we first compared the effects of the crl mutation on S - dependent gene expression in LB at 28 and 37 °C and in LB0 at 28 °C .
We used 25 chromosome - borne lacZ gene fusions in S - dependent genes that were previously isolated from a bank of Salmonella mutants harboring random Tn5B21 insertions ( 11 , 22 ) .
Expression of the S - dependent fusions in ATCC 14028 was slightly lower in LB at 28 °C than at 37 °C ( data not shown ) , but the magnitude of Crl activation in LB was greater at 28 °C than at 37 °C ( Fig. 1 ) .
At 37 °C , the induction levels caused by Crl varied from 1.3 for fusion 2.4 located in the katE gene ( 11 ) to 4.1 for fusion G57 located in the katN gene ( 20 ) .
At 28 °C , expression of katE and expression of katN were induced 2.8 - and 8.1 - fold , respectively , by Crl ( Fig. 1 ) .
The growth - rate of Salmonella in LB was reduced by 30 % at 28 °C compared to 37 °C , but the stationary - phase cultures reached similar optical densities at the two temperatures ( OD 600 , ca. 4.5 ) .
At 28 °C , the growth - rate was further reduced by 20 % in LB0 compared to LB .
However , the levels of induction of expression of the fusions by Crl at 28 °C were in the same range in both LB0 and LB ( data not shown ) .
These results indicated that temperature had an effect on the magnitude of Crl - dependent activation of gene expression .
Greater physiological effects of Crl at 28 °C than at 37 °C .
S is required for bacterial resistance to various stresses during stationary - phase ( the so - called general stress resistance ) ( 12 , 14 ) .
The S - dependent gene katE encodes a catalase , an enzyme that detoxifies H 2 O 2 and contributes to the resistance of bacteria to oxidative - stress .
In stationary - phase LB cultures of Salmonella , KatE is the major catalase ( 2 , 20 ) , and in the experimental conditions used , KatE played a major role in the resistance of ATCC 14028 to H 2 O 2 ( Fig. 2D ) .
In stationary - phase LB cultures of ATCC 14028 , transcription of katE was less efficient at 28 °C than at 37 °C ( Fig. 3A ) and more sensitive to Crl activation at 28 °C than at 37 °C ( Fig. 1 and 3A ) .
These findings were confirmed at the protein level by measurement of catalase activity ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether the effects of Crl and temperature on the level of expression of katE were relevant at the physiological level , we monitored the effect of Crl on the H 2 O 2 resistance of ATCC 14028 at 28 and 37 °C .
Upon exposure to 5 mM H 2 O 2 , the wild - type and crl strains survived well , and even the katE mutant was mildly affected ( data not shown ) .
At higher H 2 O 2 concentrations ( 15 and 30 mM ) ( Fig. 2AB ) , the impact of Crl on the level of H 2 O 2 resistance of ATCC 14028 was dependent on the growth temperature .
At 37 °C , the crl mutation had no significant effect on the H 2 O 2 resistance of ATCC 14028 , but it decreased the H 2 O 2 resistance of this strain at 28 °C .
Although the katE mutant was highly sensitive to H 2 O 2 , the rpoS mutant was even more sensitive ( Fig. 2D ) , indicating that other S - dependent H 2 O 2 defense mechanisms were involved in addition to the detoxifying KatE enzyme .
The S - dependent gene dps encodes a ferritin - like protein involved in Salmonella resistance to oxidative - stress ( 10 ) .
As observed for the other S - dependent gene fusions ( Fig. 1 ) , the dps - lacZ gene fusion was more sensitive to Crl activation at 28 °C than at 37 °C ( Fig. 3A ) .
The Dps protein was involved in the H 2 O 2 resistance of ATCC 14028 , but in the conditions used , its contribution was less marked than that of KatE ( Fig. 2D ) .
Lowering the growth temperature also increased the effects of the crl mutation on the resistance of ATCC 14028 to acidic pH ( Fig. 4 ) .
Altogether , these results showed that the physiological effects of Crl are greater at 28 °C than at 37 °C .
Production of Crl and S at 37 and 28 °C .
The smaller stimulatory effect of Crl at 37 °C than at 28 °C might be due to the fact that Crl is less abundant at high - temperature .
At 28 °C , Crl was synthesized during the early exponential - growth - phase , but the Crl protein levels increased during the late exponential and stationary growth phases ( 21 ) .
A similar pattern of Crl production was observed in LB at 37 °C , when the accumulation of Crl slightly preceded that of S ( Fig. 5A and B ) .
The levels of Crl were maximal upon entry into stationary - phase and showed significant reductions in overnight cultures ; they were less than 1.5 - fold greater at 28 °C than at 37 °C , and the effect was maximal at an OD 600 of 3.5 to 4 ( Fig. 6A ) .
The S levels were about twofold lower at 28 °C than at 37 °C as cells entered stationary - phase ( OD 600 , 2.5 to 3 ) ( Fig. 6B ) .
Therefore , temperature had a more pronounced effect on the amount of S than on the amount of Crl , and the levels of Crl and S were negatively correlated .
Crl levels are not a limiting factor for S - dependent gene expression .
The amount of Crl in cells was only slightly larger at 28 °C than at 37 °C .
However , if Crl is present at a limiting level in the cell , even a small increase in the Crl concentration might increase the Crl effects .
A high level of Crl expression can be obtained with pACcrl - 1 , a plasmid in which crl is transcribed from the cat promoter of the vector ( 21 ) .

Impact of a crl knockout mutation on H 2 O 2 resistance at 28 and 37 °C .
The resistance of Salmonella strains to H 2 O 2 was determined in stationary - phase LB cultures grown at 37 and 28 °C ( OD 600 , 3.5 to 4 ) .
( A and B ) Resistance of wild - type strain ATCC 14028 ( wt ) ( triangles ) and ATCCcrl ( crl ) ( circles ) to H 2 O 2 at concentrations of 15 mM ( A ) and 30 mM ( B ) at 37 °C ( open symbols ) and 28 °C ( filled symbols ) .
( C ) Effect of the pACYC184 vector and the pSTK4 and pACcrl - 1 plasmids ( carrying rpoS and crl , respectively ) on the H 2 O 2 resistance of ATCC 14028 ( squares and diamonds ) and ATCCcrl ( triangles and circles ) at 28 °C .

The measurements were repeated twice , and the results of a representative experiment are shown .
level was increased by introducing pACcrl - 1 , the H 2 O 2 resistance of the crl strain at 28 °C was restored to the wild - type level , but pACcrl - 1 did not further increase H 2 O 2 resistance in ATCC 14028 ( Fig. 2C ) .
We could not use pACcrl - 1 to increase the Crl level in strains harboring the katE - lacZ fusion due to the tetracycline resistance marker of Tn5B21 ( Table 1 ) .
We used pACcrl - 1-Km , which is identical to pACcrl - 1 except for the tetracycline resistance gene , in which a kanamycin resistance cartridge was inserted ( Table 1 ) .
pACcrl - 1-Km did not significantly increase the expression level of the katE - lacZ gene fusion ( Fig. 3B , compare bars 5 and 6 ) .
These results suggested that under the growth - condition used , Crl levels are not limiting in the cell .
Consistent with this hypothesis , quantitative immunoblots using standard curves with purified His - Crl and His - S proteins indicated that there were 15 to 20 fmol of S and 40 to 50 fmol of Crl per g of total proteins in LB stationary - phase cultures of ATCC 14028 grown at 37 °C ( OD 600 , 3.8 ) .
Thus , in stationary - phase at 37 °C there is a two - to threefold excess of Crl over S .
At the entry into stationary - phase , the S level is lower than the level in late stationary - phase , and thus the excess of Crl is even greater ( Fig. 5A and B ) .
The amount of S found in LB stationary - phase cultures of ATCC 14028 is similar to the amount previously found in E. coli MC4100 ( 13 ) .
S levels mediate temperature - dependent regulation of the Crl effect on H 2 O 2 resistance .
The results presented above indicate that the major stimulatory effect of Crl on S activity at low - temperature does not result from a higher level of Crl .
However , Crl might be more active at low - temperature .
To obtain further insight into this possibility , we performed in vitro single - round transcription assays with the katE promoter at 37 and 25 °C ( data not shown ) .
Many more transcripts were formed at 37 °C than at 25 °C , a finding consistent with the fact that promoter melting is facilitated by high - temperature .
Crl activation was visible at both temperatures , especially at low E / S ratios , as previously demonstrated ( 22 ) .
However , the magnitude of the Crl activation at katE did not change with temperature .
Therefore , we concluded that under the conditions used , Crl activity is not dependent on temperature .
The magnitude of the Crl effect is greater at low levels of S ( 21 , 22 ) .
Therefore , the greater effects of Crl at 28 °C than at 37 °C ( Fig. 1 , 2 , and 4 ) might result from the decreased level of S at 28 °C compared to the level at 37 °C ( Fig. 6 ) .
Consistent with this hypothesis , pSTK4 , which increases the level of S ( 21 ) ( Fig. 7 ) , reduced the magnitude of the Crl effect on the H 2 O 2 resistance of ATCC 14028 ( Fig. 2C ) and the expression of the katE - lacZ fusion ( Fig. 3B ) at 28 °C .
In addition , ATCC 14028 containing the pACYC184 vector was less resistant to VOL .
190 , 2008 TEMPERATURE EFFECT ON Crl - MEDIATED REGULATION 4457 FIG. 4 .
Effect of Crl on acid stress resistance of Salmonella at 28 and 37 °C : acid stress resistance of wild - type strain ATCC 14028 ( wt ) ( triangles ) and ATCCcrl ( crl ) ( circles ) at 37 °C ( open symbols ) and 28 °C ( filled symbols ) .
The Salmonella strains were grown to stationary phase ( OD 600 , 3.5 to 4 ) in LB at 37 and 28 °C and were subjected to acid stress ( LB , pH 3 ) .
The results of representative experiments are shown .
Similar results were obtained in repeat experiments .
Interestingly , the levels of Crl in overnight cultures were about twofold higher in the rpoS mutant than in wild - type strain ( Fig. 5C , time point 8 ) .
Moreover , increased production of S from pSTK4 reduced production of Crl in stationary - phase and overnight cultures of ATCC 14028 ( Fig. 7 ) .
This suggests that rpoS negatively regulates Crl production in stationary - phase , when the level of S is high .
Crl - dependent activation of katE and dps transcription at 28 and 37 °C .
( A ) Effect of Crl on katE and dps gene transcription at 28 and 37 °C .
Salmonella wild - type ( wt ) , crl , and rpoS strains harboring the katE - lacZ and dps - lacZ - fusions were grown in LB at 37 and 28 °C , and - galactosidase activity was measured in the stationary - phase of growth ( OD 600 , 3.5 to 4 ) .
( B ) Effect of pSTK4 and pACcrl - 1-Km on katE expression at 28 and 37 °C .
Expression of the katE - lacZ gene fusion was measured in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and its crl mutant harboring the pACYC184 and pACYC184 - Km vectors and plasmids pSTK4 and pACcrl - 1-Km that carry rpoS and crl , respectively ( Table 1 ) .
Salmonella strains were grown in LB at 37 and 28 °C , and - galactosidase activity was measured in the stationary phase of growth ( OD 600 , 3.5 to 4 ) .

H 2 O 2 and expressed lower levels of katE at 28 °C than at 37 °C , whereas similar levels of H 2 O 2 resistance and katE gene expression were found at the two temperatures in the presence of pSTK4 ( Fig. 2D and 3B and data not shown ) .
The effect of pSTK4 on katE was evident mainly at the onset of stationary phase and resulted in earlier expression of the katE - lacZ fusion , even at 37 °C ( data not shown ) .
These results suggested that Crl had a marked effect on the H 2 O 2 resistance at 28 °C because under these conditions , S levels were the limiting factor for maximal expression of S - dependent genes , including katE ; consequently , Crl plays a major role by increasing the amount of E S .
RpoS has a negative effect on Crl production in stationary phase .
Crl levels were lower in overnight cultures than in stationary - phase cultures , whereas the levels of S in these two types of cultures did not differ significantly ( Fig. 5B , compare FIG. 5 .

ATCC 14028 was grown in LB at 37 and 28 °C .
Aliquots were removed at various times ( aliquots 1 to 5 for the strain grown at 37 °C and aliquots 6 to 9 for the strain grown at 28 °C ) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti - Crl ( A ) and anti- S ( B ) antibodies .
The growth phase was determined by measuring the culture OD 600 .
Relative quantification of S and Crl in the extracts was determined as a function of OD 600 .
Five micrograms of total protein was loaded in each slot .
For relative quantification of S , a fixed amount of a His 12 - S protein was loaded into each slot .
This protein migrated slower than the wild - type S protein .
The relative amount of S was determined by dividing the intensity of the band corresponding to S in the extract by the intensity of the band corresponding to the His 12 - S protein .
For relative quantification of Crl , a fixed amount of a Salmonella extract containing a mutated Crl protein ( Crl * ) was loaded in each slot .
The Crl * protein migrated slower than the wild - type Crl protein .
The relative amount of Crl was determined by dividing the intensity of the band corresponding to Crl in the extract by the intensity of the band corresponding to the Crl * protein .
DISCUSSION The Crl protein has been proposed to be a thermosensor that favors expression of rpoS - regulated genes at low - temperature because Crl levels in E. coli MC4100 were very low at 37 °C compared to the levels at 30 °C ( 1 ) .
However , in a recent study , Crl levels in MC4100 were found to be only mildly affected by temperature ( 30 ) .
In agreement with the later report for E. coli , we found that the Crl levels in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 were only slightly increased at 28 °C compared to those at 37 °C ( Fig. 6 ) .
Nevertheless , the physiological effects of Crl were greater at 28 °C than at 37 °C ( Fig. 1 to 4 ) .
In particular , the expression of the katE gene , which encodes a S - dependent stationary - phase catalase , was induced by less than 1.5 - fold by Crl at 37 °C and by 2 - to 3 - fold at 28 °C .
Consistently , the crl mutation had no effect on the H 2 O 2 resistance of ATCC 14028 at 37 °C but significantly decreased the H 2 O 2 resistance of ATCC 14028 at 28 °C .
Crl binds S ( 1 ) and facilitates RNA polymerase holoenzyme E S formation ( 30 ) .
The plasmon surface resonance data indicate that Crl binds S with a 1:1 stoichiometry ( unpublished results ) .
One hypothesis to explain the effect of temperature on Crl - mediated activation is that Crl levels are limiting in - vivo compared to S levels , so that a small increase in the Crl level at 28 °C compared with that at 37 °C results in greater Crl effects .
However , there was a two - to threefold excess of Crl over S in stationary - phase in ATCC 14028 grown at 37 °C in LB ( and the excess was even greater during entry to stationary - phase ) .
In addition , increasing Crl levels in ATCC 14028 did not result in higher expression of the katE gene , nor did they result in greater H 2 O 2 resistance ( Fig. 2 and 3 ) .
This suggests that Crl levels are not a limiting factor for the induction of S - dependent genes .
We also showed that Crl activity in - vitro is not dependent on temperature ( data not shown ) .
This result is consistent with the finding of Typas et al. ( 30 ) , who showed that in - vitro - transcription from the synp9 promoter is similar at 30 and 37 °C .
Altogether , these results indicate that the major stimulatory effect of Crl at low - temperature is not due to the fact that Crl is more active or more abundant at low - temperature .
We previously showed that katE expression is more sensitive to Crl in ATCCrpoS LT2 , a derivative of ATCC 14028 that contains an rpoS allele with the inefficient TTG translation start codon and reduced S levels ( 22 ) .
We reasoned that the higher induction ratio for katE expression by Crl at 28 °C than at 37 °C and the marked effect of the crl mutation on the H 2 O 2 resistance of ATCC 14028 might result from a lower level of S .
Consistent with this hypothesis , the level of S in ATCC 14028 was about twofold lower at 28 °C than at 37 °C ( Fig. 6 ) , and this likely resulted in the lower levels of katE expression and H 2 O 2 resistance at 28 °C than at 37 °C ( Fig. 2 and 3 ) .
Indeed , increasing the S level at 28 °C resulted in greater H 2 O 2 resistance in ATCC 14028 ( Fig. 2C ) and a higher level of katE expression ( Fig. 3B ) .
Altogether , these results indicate that S levels are the limiting factor at 28 °C and that they mediate the observed effect of temperature on the magnitude of Crl activation .
This does not exclude the possibility of additional effects of temperature at particular promoters , for instance at promoters with low melting ability .
There may also be other environmental conditions under which the balance of Crl and S levels is set such that the presence of more Crl makes an important difference .
Consistent with a major role for Crl at low levels of S , the maximal level of Crl is reached when S begins to accumulate ( Fig. 5 ) , and Crl has a negative effect on S production ( 19 , 30 ) .
We further show here that when the level of S is high in stationary - phase and Crl may be dispensable , S exerts a negative effect on Crl production ( Fig. 5 and 7 ) .
We do not know the molecular mechanism responsible for this phenomenon , which reveals that the levels of S and Crl are intimately linked and negatively correlated .
