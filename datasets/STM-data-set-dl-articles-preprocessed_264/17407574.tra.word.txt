Abstract Background : All organisms living under aerobic atmosphere have powerful mechanisms that confer their macromolecules protection against oxygen reactive species .
Microorganisms have developed biomolecule - protecting systems in response to starvation and/or oxidative - stress , such as DNA biocrystallization with Dps ( DNA - binding protein from starved cells ) .
Dps is a protein that is produced in large amounts when the bacterial cell faces harm , which results in DNA - protection .
In this work , we evaluated the glycosylation in the Dps extracted from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium .
This Dps was purified from the crude extract as an 18 - kDa protein , by means of affinity chromatography on an immobilized jacalin column .
Results : The N - terminal sequencing of the jacalin - bound protein revealed 100 % identity with the Dps of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium .
Methyl - alpha - galactopyranoside inhibited the binding of Dps to jacalin in an enzyme - linked lectin assay , suggesting that the carbohydrate recognition domain ( CRD ) of jacalin is involved in the interaction with Dps .
Furthermore , monosaccharide compositional analysis showed that Dps contained mannose , glucose , and an unknown sugar residue .
Finally , jacalin - binding Dps was detected in larger amounts during the bacterial earlier growth periods , whereas high detection of total Dps was verified throughout the bacterial growth period .
Conclusion : Taken together , these results indicate that Dps undergoes post - translational modifications in the pre - and early stationary - phases of bacterial growth .
There is also evidence that a small mannose - containing oligosaccharide is linked to this bacterial protein .

Dps is one of the major protein components in the late stationary growth phase , and both its own stability and the stability of DNA are enhanced within DNA - Dps complexes [ 3 ] .
Dps proteins form dodecamers [ 4 ] and bind DNA without any apparent sequence specificity , which results in a highly ordered , multi - layered structure that physically protects DNA in an energy consumptionindependent process [ 5 ] .
Dps and homologous molecules have been identified in distantly related bacteria [ 4,6,7 ] , suggesting that this protein plays an essential role in bacterial vitality .
Despite the limited information about the glycosylation phenomenon in prokaryotes , it is expected that their glycoproteins should share some of the structural features of eukaryotic glycoproteins .
However , it is obvious that prokaryotic and eukaryotic glycoproteins should differ in terms of the biosynthetic route .
As in eukaryotes , prokaryotic glycans are predominantly O - or N - linked to the protein core ; nevertheless , the consensus sequences are not observed in most cases [ 8 ] .
The structures of these glycans are far more diverse in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes , resembling the somatic antigen repetitive sequences of some Gram - negative bacteria in some cases [ 9,10 ] .
In other cases , prokaryotic glycans display non - repetitive sequences , as in the case of the surface layer ( S - layer ) glycoprotein of Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum [ 11 ] .
They may also contain unusual carbohydrates , like the one found in Neisseria meningitidis pilin , where the presence of 2,4 - diacetamido - 2,4,6 - trideoxyhexose has been detected [ 12,13 ] .
Numerous functions have been attributed to the glycans of glycoproteins in eukaryotes .
In prokaryotes , however , the functional characterization of glycoproteins is still unexplored , with very few exceptions .
Halobacterium halobium , for example , seems to glycosylate the S - layer in order to maintain a rod - shaped structure [ 14 ] .
Interestingly , the structure of the glycans present in the S - layer of this microorganism resembles a type of collagen .
Other functions attributed to the glycan moieties in prokaryotic glycoproteins include increased stability and/or maintenance of protein conformation [ 15 ] , cellular signalling and adhesion [ 16 ] , physiological functions [ 17 ] , and increased pathogenicity [ 18 ] .
Furthermore , such glycan moieties are responsible for directing biological activity [ 19 ] .
The whole process of prokaryotic glycosylation is not well understood .
The general consensus is that the bacterial membrane takes part in this process , and that the mechanism involving the lipid carrier dolichol has been demonstrated [ 8,14,20 ] .
It has recently been discovered that Campylobacter jejuni has an N - glycosylation system similar to that of eukaryotes , in which a group of genes named pgl is apparently involved [ 21 ] .
The pglB gene is responsible for the expression of a protein that is very similar to the Stt3p found in eukaryotes , which is an essential component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex .
Furthermore , mutation of the pglA gene in Neisseria meningitidis suggests that it encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in the addition of a galactose residue of the trisaccharide substituent of its pilin [ 22 ] .
Since the pilin of N. meningitidis is known to be glycosylated , it is possible that both pglA and galE [ 12 ] are involved in the glycosylation process .
In this study , we have purified a protein corresponding to the Dps of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium by affinity chromatography using a column containing immobilized jacalin .
Jacalin is a lectin from Artocarpus integrifolia that binds galactose [ 23 ] and has high affinity for the Thomsen - Friedenreich or T - antigen disaccharide Galβ1 ,3 GalNAc [ 24 ] .
In addition , jacalin binds mannose and oligomannosides [ 25 ] , which makes this lectin an important tool for evaluation of protein glycosylation .
So , in this work , we present evidence that the purified Dps is glycosylated .
Results J - Dps purification and staining One liter of LB - cultured S. enterica produced approximately 1.0 g of a soluble crude extract whose protein electrophoretic profile is shown in Fig. 1A ( lane 2 ) .
The jacalin - bound fraction of the crude extract was eluted from the affinity column with 0.2 M D - galactose - containing buffer .
This chromatographic procedure allowed purification of an 18 - kDa glycoprotein , which was stained as protein by the silver method and as glycoconjugate by the PAS method ( lane 1 , fig. 1A and 1B , respectively ) .
Because the N - terminal sequence ( STAKLVKTKASNLLYTRNDV ) of this protein , obtained by Edman degradation , showed 100 % identity to the DNA - binding protein Dps of S. enterica Typhimurium LT - 2 the jacalin - bound preparation was denoted J - Dps .
A band with apparent molecular mass and staining properties similar to those of Dps was clearly visualized in the S. enterica crude extract ( Fig. 1A , lane 2 ) , but barely seen in the unbound fraction of the crude extract ( Fig. 1A , lane 3 ) .
In addition , when J - Dps was treated to undergo beta - elimination of O - glycans , it remained silverstained ( Fig. 1C , lane 2 ) but it was not possible to stain it with PAS ( Fig. 1D , lane 2 ) .
These observations suggest that O - linked carbohydrate is present in the J - Dps structure .
Page 2 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Microbial Cell Factories 2007 , 6:11 http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/6/1/11 Lectin Binding to J - Dps The jacalin carbohydrate - binding specificity has been reported on the basis of its specific interaction with the T - antigen disaccharide Galβ1 ,3 GalNAc [ 24 ] , but a recent investigation has led to the suggestion that there is promiscuity in its sugar specificity [ 26 ] .
Knowing that lectinbinding contributes to the characterization of glycoproteins , we re - examined the lectin - binding ability of J - Dps by means of a microplate lectin - binding assay .
Besides jacalin , other biotinylated lectins such as GSIB4 ( specific for α - galactosides ) , euphorbin ( specific for N - acetylgalactosamine ) , and KM + and concanavalin - A ( both specific for mannose - containing glycans ) were probed .
Among the galactose - binding lectins , only jacalin was able to bind J - Dps , providing optical density readings 20 - fold higher than those provided by GSIB4 or euphorbin ( Fig. 2A ) .
Both mannose - binding lectins bound to J - Dps , although their affinity for J - Dps was lower than that of jacalin .
The sugar recognition dependence of the jacalin binding to J - Dps was confirmed by means of an inhibition assay in which the alpha - anomer of methyl - D-galactopyranoside ( Me - αGal p ) inhibited the jacalin/Dps interaction , whereas the beta - anomer ( Me - βGal p ) did not ( Fig. 2B ) .
We also showed that D - galactose and D - mannose partially inhibited J - Dps recognition .
Because jacalin binding to J - Dps was strongly inhibited by Me - αGal p and inhibited by D - mannose , we hypothesize that the carbohydrate recognition domain ( CRD ) of the lectin is involved in such a binding .

SDS - PAGE analysis of the purified antigen of S. enterica stained with silver nitrate ( A and C ) and PAS/silver nitrate ( B and D ) .
An overnight culture of S. enterica Typhimurium UK - 1 was pelleted , washed , and sonicated .
After centrifugation , the supernatant was collected for chromatography on a jacalin column immobilized on Sepharose ® .
A single band of approximately 18 kDa delayed in the column was eluted with D - galactose and stained by both methods ( lane 1 , A and B ) .
An equivalent band can be visualized ( arrow ) in the crude extract before chromatography ( lane 2 , A ) , and it is much less intense in the non - delayed fraction ( lane 3 , A ) .
Dps was also submitted to beta - elimination reaction with NH 4 OH ( C and D ) .
Intact ( native ) J - Dps was stained by both methods ( lane 1 , C and D ) , whereas the NH 4 OH - treated protein was stained with silver nitrate but not with PAS ( lane 2 , C and D , respectively ) .
The 18 - kDa protein displayed an N - terminal sequence similar to that of the DNA - binding protein ( Dps ) of S. enterica Typhimurium LT - 2 .
Molecular mass markers : lactoalbumin ( 14 kDa ) , trypsin - inhibitor ( 20 kDa ) , carbonic anhydrase ( 30 kDa ) , hen egg albumin ( 43 kDa ) , and bovine serum albumin ( 67 kDa ) .
Mass Spectrometry Analysis of J - Dps Analysis of the J - Dps preparation by ESI - MS , solubilized in formic acid 10 % , showed a collection of peaks with variable molecular masses ( Fig. 3 ) .
The sequence of Dps protein predicted for Salmonella , with excised N - terminal methionine , has a deduced molecular mass of 18,586 Da , which is very close ( 18,587 Da ) to the molecular mass of the second most abundant peak .
We could also detect varying amounts of degradation products resulting from the loss of the N - terminal serine ( 18,499 Da ) up to lysine ( 18,200 Da ) and leucine ( 18,087 Da ) .
Other minor peaks could also be detected and their correlation with the Dps molecule remains to be investigated .
Monosaccharide composition as determined by GC - MS analysis of the trimethylsilyl ( TMS ) derivatives indicated the presence of glucose , mannose , and an unknown component in significant amount ( Fig. 4 ) .
Because glucose has commonly been associated with sample contamination , we focused our attention on the presence of both mannose and the unknown component only .
In spite of having been purified on a jacalin column , we could not identify any traces of galactose or N - acetyl - galactosamine in the J - Dps sample .
Glycosylated Dps is produced in the pre - and early stationary - phases of bacterial growth Antibodies anti - Dps , produced by immunization of BALB/c mice , were highly reactive ( up to 1:128,000 serum dilution ) with the antigen - coated microplates ( data not Page 3 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Microbial Cell Factories 2007 , 6:11 http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/6/1/11 Molecular mass analysis of Dps by ESI - MS Figure 3 Molecular mass analysis of Dps by ESI - MS .

In the Western blot of the J - Dps preparation , narrow doublet and triplet bands are revealed ( Fig. 5B , J - Dps ) , ranging from 15 - kDa to18 kDa .
This same pattern of bands has been observed in recombinant Dps over - expressed in S. enterica cells ( unpublished results ) .
binding Figure Dps binds lectins 2 to jacalin , via CRD , but not to other galactose - Dps binds to jacalin , via CRD , but not to other galactose - binding lectins .
Isolectin B4 of Griffonia simplicifolia ( GSIB4 ) , euphorbin from Euphorbia milli , jacalin and KM + from Artocarpus integrifolia , and concanavalin - A were biotinylated and their interactions with Dps in solid phase were assessed ( A ) .
The negative control was performed in the absence of lectins .
The binding of biotinylated jacalin to Dps in solid phase was assessed in the presence of sugars at a concentration of 0.1 M ( B ) .
The alpha - anomer of methylgalactose ( Jac - αgal ) inhibited the jacalin/Dps binding drastically , whereas the beta anomer ( Jac - βgal ) did not .
A solution of D - galactose ( Jac - αβgal ) and D - mannose ( Jac - man ) partially inhibited this interaction .
PBS was the control in the absence of sugars and lectins .
Anti - Dps was used to estimate the relative antigen concentration during the S. enterica growth phase .
Cell - lysate extracts obtained from bacteria cultured for different time intervals were added to jacalin - or anti - Dps - coated wells of a microplate .
Binding was detected through the addition of anti - Dps antibody and revealed by labeled antimurine IgG .
Dps capturing by specific antibodies confirmed literature data concerning the higher antigen concentration in the late stationary - phase of bacterial growth ( Fig. 6A ) .
On the other hand , the relative concentration of Dps captured by jacalin was higher in the earlier growth stages ( from 5 to 7 hours ) , decreasing thereafter ( from 8 to 24 hours ) .
Maximum Dps concentration was captured by jacalin coating in the lysate of cells taken from 7 - hour cultures ( Fig. 6B ) .
Discussion Dps expression has been proven to be controlled by either the Sigma factor δ S in the stationary - phase of bacterial growth or the transcriptional activator oxyR when the bacterial cell faces oxidative hazards [ 27 ] .
In vitro growth results in depletion of all the nutrients , leading to morphological and physiological changes in the bacterial cells that will help them adapt to an environment where carbon sources are scarce .
In this way , bacterial cells in the stationary growth phase are smaller , both the protein synthesis and the number of ribosomes are reduced , and the Page 4 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Microbial Cell Factories 2007 , 6:11 http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/6/1/11 Western anti - Dps Figure 5blot of S. enterica antigens and J - Dps detection with Western blot of S. enterica antigens and J - Dps detection with anti - Dps .

) could not be identified through database matching of the electron impact fragmentation spectrum .
DNA molecules are sequestered and structurally protected by energy - independent intracellular assemblies [ 3 ] .
The observation that an 18 - kDa protein of S. enterica was able to bind to immobilized jacalin and the fact that this protein has an N - terminal sequence displaying 100 % identity to Dps have led us to hypothesize that glycosylation occurs in the DNA - binding protein of this bacterium strain .
In addition , SDS - PAGE analysis of J - Dps stained for proteins and glycoconjugates reinforces the glycosylation hypothesis .
It is important to bear in mind some aspects of these staining methods : i ) proteins are stained with silver nitrate , whereas carbohydrates in glycoconjugates are oxidized by periodate and stained by silver nitrate dissolved in alkaline buffer ( PAS - silver nitrate ) ; ii ) PAS - silver nitrate is likely to stain proteins , but with lower sensitivity ; iii ) in the case of glycoproteins , silver nitrate might have a double function , thus staining oligosaccharides and polypeptides ; iv ) in our assays we verified that the glycoprotein hen - egg albumin is stained by PAS - silver nitrate , whereas the non - glycosylated protein bovine albumin is not ( data not shown ) .
Although Dps has already been well characterized in Enterobacteriaceae as well as in Salmonella [ 1,4,28 ] , there is no report of glycosylation on its molecule .
In other words , Dps purification by affinity chromatography on lectin - immobilized columns has never been considered .
During beta elimination , the beta - carbon of the amino acid residue ( s ) to which the glycan ( s ) was/were attached react ( s ) with ammonium hydroxide to yield a modified amino - acid - residue and release the O - linked oligosaccharide ( s ) .
The beta elimination reaction shown in Fig. 1 made the detection of J - Dps by the PAS - silver nitrate staining method impossible , corroborating the discriminatory capacity of this method .
This result supports the idea of glycosylation in the Dps molecule .
We have investigated sugar inhibition of jacalin binding and our results are in agreement with the jacalin binding specificity [ 29 ] .
The fact that the binding of biotinylated jacalin to coated J - Dps was totally abolished by Me - αGal p , and not by the Me - βGal p , indicates that the carbohydrate recognition domain ( CRD ) of the lectin is involved Page 5 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Microbial Cell Factories 2007 , 6:11 http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/6/1/11 Among the lectins tested herein , jacalin has remarkable ability to interact with J - Dps .
Because jacalin is mainly known as a galactoside - binding lectin , we conjectured that J - Dps could contain galactoside residues on its molecule .
However , other tested galactose - binding lectins did not recognize J - Dps , while mannose - binding lectins , such as ConA and KM + , did interact with J - Dps ( Fig. 2A ) .
A 0.2 M mannose solution inhibited the J - Dps interaction with jacalin ( Fig. 2B ) , ConA , and KM + ( not shown ) .
As expected , Me - αGal p , a higher affinity ligand for jacalin , inhibited jacalin binding to J - Dps , a fact that was attributed to the hindrance of the jacalin CRD .
Interpretation of the results concerning J - Dps binding to lectins has become clear from the results obtained with the carbohydrate analysis by GC - MS of the J - Dps molecule .
Carbohydrate compositional analysis gave evidence of the presence of mannose , glucose , and a third unknown residue .
Because glucose has been commonly identified as contaminant species in this kind of assay , we have considered that its presence is irrelevant .
Indeed , D - mannose , and not D - galactose , was detected , leading us to assume that binding to jacalin is attributed to a secondary affinity of the lectin for mannose and oligomannosides [ 25 ] associated to the unknown residue , which might have some role in this binding .
Furthermore , unusual saccharide residues have been reported as components of many glycoproteins or polysaccharides in prokaryotes [ 30 - 33 ] , and this might be the case of the unknown residue that did not match any component of the standard .
The detailed structure of the J - Dps oligosaccharide by meticulous structural analysis using GC - MS , ESI - MS , nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) , and other analytical techniques is underway .

Crude extracts of S. enterica ( A : 25 μg and B : 5 μg each sample ) from different growth periods were added ( 100 μl/well ) to the wells of a microplate coated with jacalin ( A ) or rabbit antibody anti - Dps ( B ) .
Dps detection was performed , in both cases , with murine antibody anti - Dps .
Results are the read average and standard deviation of triplicates , and are expressed as the absorbance at 492 nm .
Sa , crude extract of Staphylococcus aureus ; Ctrl , control with no added crude extract .
This result has led us to another clue with respect to the Dps glycosylation purpose .
Some points concerning characteristics of the Dps molecule are important and should be mentioned , with respect to the ESI - MS analysis .
Firstly , self - aggregation of E. coli Dps is related to the properties of the amino terminus of this protein [ 34 ] .
In fact , self - aggregation of this protein leads to the formation of oligomers of variable size , which tend to precipitate .
This might explain why we had to solubilize J - Dps in formic acid 10 % to properly analyze it by ESI - MS .
Secondly , Dps is supposed to lose up to 6 residues at the N - terminus [ 1 ] , producing varying amounts of a minor degradation product .
In fact , we were able to detect these N - terminus degradation specimens in different J - Dps preparations .
Finally , the two most potential O - glycosylation sites as determined by NetOGlyc 3.1 [ 35 ] lie close to near threshold values for this algorithm and are located on positions 2 and 3 of the polypeptide - chain .
These positions are supposed to be excised away by the degradation predicted at the N - terminus .
As in eukaryotes [ 36 ] , nuclear protein glycosylation can be very labile , and J - Dps solubilization could have accelerated deglycosylation and/or N - terminus degradation processes , making the detection of any glycoprotein traces difficult .
J - Dps preparation after long term storage at -20 °C showed a pattern of doublet/triplet bands .
A similar pattern is observed Page 6 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Microbial Cell Factories 2007 , 6:11 http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/6/1/11 with the fresh preparations of Dps obtained from recombinant strains ( unpublished results ) .
However , we could not establish any correlation between the glycosylation and degradation processes .
In eukaryotes , there are many transcriptional factors that , in certain periods of time , interchange the phosphorylation/O - GlcNAc - glycosylation state to exert stress - protective functions for important biomolecules such as DNA .
Nuclear proteins containing O - GlcNAc have been shown to form reversible multimers and to be phosphorylated [ 37,38 ] .
Addition of O - GlcNAc to the protein backbone is dynamic and it has been shown to respond to cellular stress and changes in glucose metabolism [ 36 ] .
Interestingly , Dps was identified as a phosphoprotein in a model study of E. coli physiology [ 39 ] .
The present work indicates that S. enterica Dps is a glycoprotein , which supposedly adds important data to a phenomenon that has been proven to be ubiquitous in eukaryotes .
Several works have demonstrated that the bacterial cell accumulates large amounts of Dps during the stationary growth phase [ 1,3,5,27,28,40 ] .
Thus , when the bacterial cell faces nutritional depletion during the stationary phase , Dps rises up to 23 -- 25 - fold its initial amount per cell , thus becoming the most abundant component in the cell during that period [ 41 ] .
Likewise , Dps concentration is also supposed to be regulated by a proteolysis mechanism , in which the enzymes ClpXP and ClpAP might play an important role in the modulation of Dps degradation [ 42 ] .
We have observed that the jacalin - coated microplate captured more Dps from the crude extract of S. enterica obtained from earlier growth periods than from the crude extract obtained from later growth phases .
This reveals a relative concentration curve opposed to the one reported for Dps concentration [ 41 ] , which was confirmed herein through the assay using anti - Dps coated microplates .
Once Dps production and accumulation is primarily associated with stationary - phase , it would be possible that another immuno - reactive product in logarithmically growing cells could be cross - reacting with the anti - Dps antibody .
However , the monospecificity of the anti - Dps antibodies produced in BALB/c mice is suggested by the development of a single band in the immunoblot of crude S. enterica lysate .
In addition , detection of Dps in cells growing logarithmically is consistent with a previous systematic immunoblot analysis of E. coli cell lysates , showing that in the exponential - growth - phase one single cell contains around 6,000 Dps molecules [ 41 ] .
Therefore , we are tempted to suggest that the S. enterica component captured by jacalin on each well was most probably Dps , and there might be a kind of modulation that leads to the acquisition of suitable glycosylated/non - glycosylated molecule ratios in the bacterial cell in certain growth periods .
Because Dps is a DNA - binding protein and its binding is associated with nutritional depletion or oxidative stress , glycosylation appears to be inversely related to the DNA - binding process .
Thus , bacterial cells growing exponentially should keep a certain amount of Dps for an eventual stress condition where , instead of the de novo synthesis , pre - existing molecules would be ready to bind and protect DNA , and glycosylation might play a role in this mechanism .
Conclusion It is clear that Dps production is finely regulated by the bacterial cell , and its production responds to many stimuli in the growth medium .
Our work has shown that immobilized jacalin hooked one of the several constituents of the crude extract of S. enterica .
Whether glycosylation really occurs in any other bacterial DNA - binding protein is an intriguing question .
Dps is a stress inducible DNA binding protein , and we have gathered evidence that this molecule is , at least for a certain period of the bacterial cell physiology , glycosylated .
To our knowledge , this is the first description of glycosylation in a prokaryotic DNA - binding protein .
Methods Bacterial strain , growth and processing The strain UK - 1 ( Universal Killer ) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium χ3761 was kindly provided by Dr. Roy Curtis III ( Washington University , Washington , DC , USA ) , and cells were grown in Luria - Bertani medium at 37 °C for 18 h at 200 rpm .

The sugar inhibition assay was performed as described above , including an extra step in the carbohydrate inhibition test .
Biotinylated jacalin was incubated with 50 mM alpha - methyl - D-galactose , 50 mM beta - methyl - D-galactose , 50 mM D - galactose , or 50 mM D - mannose prior to adhesion to J - Dps in the microtiter plate .
The negative control was the lectin - absent assay .
Immunoblot BALB/c mice and rabbits were used for production of anti- Dps antibodies .
Immunization was carried out by intraperitoneal injection of 10 μg ( mice ) or 100 μg ( rabbit ) of J - Dps in PBS , emulsified in complete Freund 's adjuvant , followed by three boosts ( on days 21 , 28 , and 35 ) with the same amount of J - Dps , emulsified in the incomplete Freund 's adjuvant .
The antiserum was obtained 1 week after the last boost and its reactivity with Dps was analyzed by immunoblotting .
Pellets from 1.5 ml culture of S. enterica were lysed in 100 μl reducing buffer [ recipe for 10 ml : 3.55 ml deionized water , 1.25 ml 0.5 M Tris - HCl ( pH 6.8 ) , 2.5 ml glycerol , 2.0 ml sodium dodecyl sulfate 10 % ( w/v ) , 0.2 ml bromophenol blue 0.5 % ( w/v ) , and 0.5 ml 2 - mercapto - ethanol ) ] .
Polyacrylamide gel was electrotransferred to the nitrocellulose membrane ( Millipore Co. , Billerica , MA , USA ) .
Nonspecific interactions were blocked with 3 % skimmed milk ( Nestlé Brazil ) in PBS - T ( see above ) for 2 h at 25 °C .
Dps was detected by incubation overnight with anti - Dps serum diluted at 1:4000 in 1 % skimmed milk in PBS - T .
The antigen - antibody reaction was detected after overnight incubation with peroxidase conjugate anti - mouse or anti - rabbit IgG antibody ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) diluted 1:2000 in 1 % skimmed milk in PBS - T , and revealed with 0.3 % 4 - chloro - naphtol [ 20 ml 0.05 M Tris - Cl ( pH 6.8 ) , 7 μl hydrogen - peroxide , and 5 ml 4 - chloro - naphtol 0.3 % ( w/v in methanol ) ] .
ELISA Crude extracts of S. enterica from different growth periods were diluted to equalize the amount of protein with that of the less concentrated sample .
Rabbit anti - Dps ( 1 μg / well ) or purified jacalin ( 1 μg/well ) were coated on microtiter plates .
The jacalin - coated plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 25 μg ( 100 μl/well ) of one of the samples of the crude extract ( 3 -- 18 and 24 hours of growth ) , whereas the anti - Dps - coated plate was submitted to the same incubation conditions with 5 μg ( 100 μl/well ) of the samples .
Murine anti - Dps ( 100 μl/well ) diluted 1:4000 was used as primary antibody , and rabbit peroxidase - conjugated antimouse IgG antibody ( 100 μl/well ) diluted 1:2000 ( Sigma Chemical Co. ) was the secondary antibody .
The crude extract from an overnight culture of Staphylococcus aureus was used as control .
All buffers used for coating , blocking , washing , substrate reaction , and reading were the same as described above .
Results are expressed as the absorbance at 492 nm .
Molecular mass analysis Protein molecular mass profiles were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( ESI - MS ) using a Finnigan LCQ Duo ion - trap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Page 8 of 10 ( page number not for citation purposes ) Microbial Cell Factories 2007 , 6:11 http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/6/1/11 Electron Co. , San Jose , CA , USA ) .
Spectra were acquired in the positive - ion mode , and molecular masses were calculated by mass deconvolution using the Xcalibur software ( Thermo Electron Co. ) .
Potential glycosylation sites were predicted using GlycoMod and NetOGlyc 3.1 [ 51 ] .
Carbohydrate analysis An aliquot of J - Dps ( 200 picomoles ) was hydrolyzed with 0.5 M hydrochloric acid - methanol ( Supelco , Bellefonte , PA , USA ) , under N 2 atmosphere , to avoid oxidation .
Acid was removed by vacuum at 40 °C .
Monosaccharide compositional analysis was accomplished by preparing alditol acetate derivatives of the glycan components , followed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( GC/MS ) analysis as described [ 52 ] .
