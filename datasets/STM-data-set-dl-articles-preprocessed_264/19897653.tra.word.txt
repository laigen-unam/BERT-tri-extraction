Groisman * Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Department of Molecular Microbiology , Washington University School of Medicine , St. Louis , Missouri 63110 The MgtA protein from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium mediates Mg 2 uptake from the periplasm into the cytoplasm .
Here we report that the PhoP/PhoQ two - component regulatory system , which responds to periplasmic Mg 2 , governs mgtA transcription initiation at all investigated Mg 2 concentrations and that the Mg 2 - sensing 5 leader region of the mgtA gene controls transcription elongation into the mgtA coding region when Salmonella is grown in media with < 50 M Mg 2 .
Overexpression of the Mg 2 transporter CorA , which is believed to increase cytoplasmic Mg 2 levels , decreased mgtA transcription in a manner dependent on a functional mgtA 5 leader .
Expression of the Mg 2 transporter gene mgtA from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is regulated at both the transcription initiation and elongation steps .
Transcription initiation is dependent on the two - component regulatory system PhoP/PhoQ ( 9 ) , which is activated in response to low Mg 2 ( 8 ) , acid - pH ( 16 ) , and antimicrobial peptides ( 1 ) sensed in the periplasm by the PhoQ protein .
Transcription elongation into the mgtA coding region is controlled by the 5 leader region of the mgtA transcript , which functions as a Mg 2 - sensing device or riboswitch ( 5 ) and renders the transcript susceptible to degradation by RNase E ( 20 ) .
The mgtA leader region can adopt alternative stem - loop structures that favor or hinder transcription elongation into the mgtA coding region at low and high Mg 2 , respectively ( 5 ) .
In addition , overexpression of the regulatory gene rob promotes mgtA transcription from a site located 44 nucleotides downstream of the PhoP - dependent transcription start site ( 2 ) , thereby generating an mgtA transcript with a shorter leader region that could lack some of the Mg 2 - sensing elements .
To examine the contributions that the PhoP - dependent mgtA promoter and the mgtA riboswitch make to the Mg 2 - regulated expression of the mgtA gene , we constructed a set of four isogenic strains with alterations in the promoter and/or riboswitch regions of the chromosomal copy of the mgtA gene , as well as a lac transcriptional - fusion at position 977 in the mgtA open reading frame ( position 1 corresponds to the PhoPdependent transcription start site in the wild - type strain ) ( Fig. 1A ) .
All four strains are derived from wild - type strain 14028s and have a cat cassette ( conferring resistance to chloramphenicol ) upstream of the promoter , which does not alter mgtA expression and was used as a selectable marker when moving mutations into different genetic backgrounds .

YS773 -- retains the wild - type PhoP - dependent promoter and mgtA 5 leader region .
The second strain -- YS783 -- contains nucleotide substitutions in the DNA sequence corresponding to positions 151 to 160 of the mgtA 5 leader region , where the sequence AGAUGUUUC replaced the original GUAAGAC AGU , which was anticipated to interfere with the formation of stem - loop B , a structure normally formed in cells experiencing high Mg 2 ( 5 ) .
The third strain -- YS802 -- lacks the PhoPdependent wild - type promoter and harbors a derivative of the lac promoter -- designated p lac1 - 6 -- ( 12 ) that responds neither to PhoP nor to Mg 2 ( 5 ) .
( This strain retains the normal Mg 2 response of the mgtA riboswitch despite lacking the first 31 nucleotides of the mgtA leader region [ 5 ] .
) The fourth strain -- YS812 -- combines the PhoP - independent p lac1 - 6 promoter present in strain YS802 with the mutant mgtA 5 leader of strain YS783 .
The construction of strains YS773 and YS802 has been reported elsewhere ( 5 ) .
Strains YS783 and YS812 were made by the one - step gene disruption method ( 6 ) , using chromosomal DNA from strains YS773 and YS802 , respectively , as templates to create PCR - generated DNA fragments for substitution using primers 4416 ( 5 - TGATTTCCCTAC GCCGCTCAGGCGGGCGATGTCTTTGATAG TGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC ) and 4479 ( 5 - CCTTGCCC GATGAGCAATGTTTAAATAAAAACAGGGACGTTA TTGTGTCGAAAACATCTACACCGGTAAGACAGCAG AGG ) .
The resulting DNA was integrated into the chromosome of strain EG9521 ( 8 ) , harboring a lac transcriptional fusion in the mgtA coding region .
We determined the - galactosidase activity produced by the four isogenic strains following 4hofgrowth in N - minimal medium , pH 7.4 ( 19 ) , supplemented with 0.1 % Casamino Acids , 38 mM glycerol , and different Mg 2 concentrations spanning a 1,000 - fold range as described previously ( 13 ) .
There was no - galactosidase activity in strain YS773 following growth at 5 or 10 mM Mg 2 , presumably because the PhoP protein is not activated under such high Mg 2 concentrations ( 8 ) .
However , the - galactosidase levels increased as the Mg 2 concentration decreased with a dramatic jump between 50 and 10 M Mg 2 ( Fig. 1B ; notice log scale of x axis ) , as previously reported ( 5 , 21 ) .
In contrast , there was little mgtA transcription 604 VOL .
Distinct roles for the mgtA promoter and mgtA riboswitch in mgtA expression .
( A ) Schematic representation of four isogenic strains with wild - type ( P mgtA ) or variant ( P lac1 - 6 ) promoters and wildtype ( black line ) or mutant ( black line interrupted by white box ) mgtA leader regions .
( B ) - Galactosidase activity produced by the four strains depicted in panel A grown for 4hinN - minimal - medium with the indicated Mg 2 concentrations .
Data correspond to the average of two experiments conducted in duplicate .
when strain YS802 was grown in media with 50 M Mg 2 , some transcription in 50 M Mg 2 , and maximum levels in 10 M Mg 2 ( Fig. 1B ) .
The similar - galactosidase activity produced by strain YS802 when grown in 10 mM and 100 M Mg 2 reflects the Mg 2 - insensitive nature of the p lac1 - 6 promoter ( 5 ) .
For both YS773 and YS802 , the largest difference in mgtA expression was observed following growth in 50 versus 10 M Mg 2 ( Fig. 1B ) .
Because these strains differ in the promoter transcribing the mgtA gene ( Fig. 1A ) , we hypothesized that the shared sequences in the 5 leader region were likely responsible for the significant mgtA derepression displayed in organisms grown in 10 M Mg 2 .
Consistent with this notion , strain YS783 , with the mutant mgtA 5 leader but wild - type mgtA promoter ( Fig. 1A ) , produced similar - galactosidase activity when grown in media containing 50 and 10 M Mg 2 ( Fig. 1B ) .
Finally , strain YS812 made - galactosidase at the same levels at all seven Mg 2 concentrations ( Fig. 1B ) , indicating that it lacks the sequence information to modulate mgtA expression in response to changes in the levels of Mg 2 .
Strain YS802 synthesized less - galactosidase than the double mutant YS812 when grown in the presence of 100 Mto10 mM Mg 2 ( Fig. 1B ) , which may reflect the dampening effect exerted by the riboswitch at high Mg 2 .
This effect is highlighted also by the consistently higher levels of mgtA transcription displayed by strain YS783 than strain YS773 , both of which share the PhoP - activated mgtA promoter but differ in that the latter harbors a functional riboswitch but the former does not , when bacteria were grown in the presence of 50 M to1mMMg 2 ( Fig. 1B ) .
Yet , at 10 M Mg 2 , the strains with the wild - type mgtA leader region produced higher - galactosidase activity than their respective isogenic strains with a mutant mgtA leader ( Fig. 1B ) .
This indicates that the mgtA leader region both promotes transcription of the mgtA coding region in low Mg 2 and decreases its transcription in high Mg 2 .
Cumulatively , our data demonstrated that the PhoP - dependent mgtA promoter controls mgtA expression over the whole range of Mg 2 concentrations tested ( i.e. , 10 M to10mM Mg 2 ) whereas the mgtA riboswitch exerts its regulatory effect primarily when bacteria experience 50 M Mg 2 .
Because transcription elongation into the mgtA coding region responds to cytoplasmic Mg 2 via the mgtA riboswitch , we reasoned that synthesis of the MgtA protein might also take place under other conditions promoting a drop in the cytoplasmic Mg 2 concentration .
In other words , the MgtA protein might be observed earlier if Salmonella is grown in media with aMg 2 concentration of 10 M but at later times if the Mg 2 concentration is 10 M , as one would anticipate that Mg 2 would be exhausted at earlier and later times , respectively .
To test this hypothesis ( and because anti - MgtA antibodies were not available ) , we engineered a Salmonella strain expressing a C - terminal FLAG - tagged MgtA protein from its normal promoter and chromosomal location and harboring the wild - type 5 leader region .
The FLAG epitope was introduced as described previously ( 22 ) by amplifying the cat gene from plasmid pKD3 by the PCR with the following primers : MgtA - FLAG , 2048 ( 5 - GTTGGTGAAAGGGTTTTACAGCAGAC GTTATGGCTGGCAGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGAC AAGTAACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG - 3 ) and 2049 ( 5 - TCGGGGATTAAGCACGCTGGCGAATCCCCGACGAA AGTGTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC - 3 ) .
Addition of the FLAG tag does not appear to disrupt normal MgtA protein function because the corA mgtB mgtA - FLAG strain MJC116 grew as well as the isogenic corA mgtB mgtA strain EG10983 in LB - medium ( data not shown ) , whereas the corA mgtB mgtA triple mutant did not grow in LB unless supplemented with high concentrations of Mg 2 , as described previously ( 11 ) .
The MgtA - FLAG - expressing strain EG13250 was grown in 10 mM Mg 2 and then harvested at different times after organisms were switched to media with different Mg 2 concentrations .
Western blot analysis was carried out with crude cell extracts prepared from the different cell cultures and developed with anti - FLAG antibodies ( Fig. 2 ) .
We determined that the lower the Mg 2 concentration , the earlier the MgtA - FLAG protein was produced .
For instance , MgtA - FLAG was detected after 2.5 h in organisms switched to 2 MMg 2 , after 4 h when Salmonella was grown in 20 MMg 2 , and only after 5 h in organisms experiencing 40 M Mg 2 ( Fig. 2 ) .
As expected , the levels of the Mg 2 transporter CorA , which was used as control because CorA expression is PhoP/PhoQ independent and nonresponsive to changes in the concentration of Mg 2 in the growth media ( 3 ) , were similar at the investigated times and Mg 2 concentrations ( Fig. 2 ) .
Thus , even though the PhoP - activated mgtA and phoP promoters are bound by the PhoP protein at the same time and transcription of the mgtA leader sequence happens concurrently with that of the phoP gene ( 17 ) , production of the MgtA protein takes place 4 h later than that of the PhoP protein ( Fig. 2 ) ( 17 ) .
Synthesis of the MgtA protein is determined by the length of time and the Mg 2 concentration in which Salmonella is grown .
Western blot analysis of crude extracts prepared from strain EG13250 coding for an MgtA - FLAG protein following growth in N - minimal - medium with the indicated Mg 2 concentrations and incubation times .
Blots were probed with both anti - FLAG ( top ) and anti - CorA ( bottom ) antibodies .
If MgtA synthesis is triggered when the cytoplasmic Mg 2 drops below a certain threshold , as one would expect from MgtA being regulated by a Mg 2 - responding riboswitch , artificially increasing cytoplasmic Mg 2 levels may hinder synthesis of the MgtA protein .
To explore this possibility , we examined the chromosomally encoded MgtA - FLAG protein levels by Western blot analysis in bacteria carrying plasmid pUCcorA , which expresses the Mg 2 transporter gene corA from the vector plac promoter , or the plasmid vector pUC19 ( 23 ) .
MgtA - FLAG could be detected in the latter but not in the former strain ( Fig. 3A ) .
( As expected , there was no reactivity in extracts prepared from the wild - type strain lacking the FLAG tag [ Fig. 3A ] .
) Likewise , when streaked onto 1 % agar plates containing N - minimal media , pH 7.4 , supplemented with 0.1 % Casamino Acids , 38 mM glycerol , 10 M MgCl 2 , and the chromogenic LacZ substrate X - Gal ( 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - - D - galactopyranoside ; 60 g/ml ; Gold Biotechnology , Inc. ) , strain EG9170 , harboring a chromosomal mgtA - lac transcriptional fusion , formed blue colonies when containing pUC19 but white colonies when carrying pUC - corA ( Fig. 3B ) .
The silencing effect of the corA - expressing plasmid is exerted on the mgtA riboswitch because the pUC - corA plasmid had no effect on the expression of strain EG9220 harboring a lac fusion at the sixth nucleotide of the mgtA 5 leader region and thus lacking the mgtA riboswitch ( Fig. 3B ) , but could silence mgtA expression in strain EG9170 with a lac fusion at position 2190 .
Moreover , mgtA expression in strain EG17425 , with a defective mgtA riboswitch due to replacement of the 100 - bp sequence corresponding to positions 148 to 247 in the wildtype mgtA 5 leader ( 5 ) by the 84 - bp `` scar '' sequence ( 6 ) , was refractory to repression by the pUC - corA plasmid ( Fig. 3B ) .
In sum , we have established that production of the Mg 2 transporter MgtA is ultimately governed by the Mg 2 levels in the cytoplasm , which are sensed by the mgtA riboswitch .
Expression of the mgtA gene is also controlled at the transcription initiation step via the two - component system PhoP/PhoQ responding to periplasmic Mg 2 .
Because the PhoP/PhoQ system is a major regulator of virulence functions ( 9 ) and the mgtA gene is not required for pathogenicity , the mgtA riboswitch may enable Salmonella to produce the MgtA protein only when the cytoplasmic Mg 2 concentration falls below a certain level and thus differentially from other gene products belonging to the PhoP regulon .
Indeed , there is no mgtA expression when Salmonella experiences acid - pH ( 4 ) even though the PhoP/PhoQ system is activated by acid - pH ( 16 ) .
The mgtA expression behavior is in contrast to that of the Fe 2 transporter gene feoB , which is turned on via the PhoP - activated RstA protein when Salmonella faces acid - pH but not in response to low Mg 2 ( 4 ) .
As rstA transcription is also induced in low Mg 2 ( 14 , 20 , 24 ) , these findings suggest that acid - pH is necessary for activation of the RstA protein .
Finally , there is increasing evidence suggesting the intriguing possibility that signals other than Mg 2 may act on the mgtA leader region to promote transcription elongation into the mgtA coding region .
First , mutations in the mgtA leader region resulting in heightened mgtA expression enhanced the thermo - FIG. 3 .

Second , rob overexpression confers resistance to cyclohexane in an mgtA - dependent manner ( 2 ) .
And third , inactivation of the RNA chaperone Hfq promoted mgtA expression ( 7 , 18 ) while decreasing the mRNA levels of other PhoP - activated genes ( 18 ) .
( The mgtA gene appears to be regulated in a different manner in Escherichia coli because hfq inactivation led to increased mgtA transcription [ 10 ] .
) Moreover , the dual control of mgtA expression at the transcription initiation and elongation steps is unusual for genes regulated by riboswitches , as they are typically transcribed from constitutive promoters .
Therefore , we hypothesize that metabolic signals , environmental or cellular cues , and/or regulatory trans - acting factors may act on the mgtA leader region so that mgtA transcription initiated at intermediate Mg 2 concentrations in a PhoP - dependent manner ( 5 ) ( Fig. 1B ) can continue into the mgtA coding region , resulting in the synthesis of the MgtA protein even if the Mg 2 concentration in the cytoplasm is relatively high .
