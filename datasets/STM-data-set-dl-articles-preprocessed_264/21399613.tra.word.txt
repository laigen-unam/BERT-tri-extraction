We demonstrate that mgtL translation is required to prematurely terminate mgtA transcription .
Abrogation of mgtL translation by mutation of its start codon results in transcription of the mgtA - coding region in high Mg 2 þ , suggesting that ribosome stalling is not required for preventing premature transcription termination .
Consistently , the Mg 2 þ riboswitch responds to cytoplasmic Mg 2 þ , but not to proline or arginine , both repeatedly present in the MgtL sequence , to mediate mgtL translation - coupled regulation .
RNA structural probing and nucleotide substitution analysis show that the riboswitch loop A region alters base pairing in response to Mg 2 þ , and favours stem - loop A1 in high Mg 2 þ , subsequently opening the ribosome - binding sequence for mgtL translation .
Presumably , mgtL ORF directs translation to localize a ribosome in cis to act on downstream RNA in a manner similar to some upstream ORFs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes .

It is suggested that two independent mechanisms are involved in Mg 2 þ - dependent transcriptional regulation of mgtA .
( i ) The PhoP/PhoQ two - component system responds to micromolar levels of environmental Mg 2 þ and activates transcription initiation ; or to milli - molar levels of Mg 2 þ and represses transcription initiation ( Garcia Vescovi et al , 1996 ) .
( ii ) Once transcription is initiated , the 5 0 untranslated region ( here , called the 5 0 leader region or 5 0 LR ) of nascent mgtA transcripts functions as an alternative Mg 2 þ - sensing system .
If the Mg 2 þ concentration increases in the bacterial cytoplasm , the latter system interrupts mgtA transcription before it is extended to the downstream coding region ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
In Salmonella , the mgtA transcript initiated from the QJ ; PhoP - activated promoter contains a 264 - nt 5 0 LR ( Lejona et al , 2003 ) , which contains a cis - acting regulatory element responsive to Mg 2 þ .
This element is similar to other riboswitches that are able to interact with a small molecule , normally a specific metabolite , and modify the RNA structures through stem - loop switching , subsequently exerting their regulatory effects ( review see ref .
A structural probing of the 5 0 LR showed that a high Mg 2 þ condition ( 3.5 mM ) induced regions containing nucleotides 56 -- 125 and 136 -- 159 to form stem - loops A and B ( see ref .
Cromie et al ( 2006 ) and illustrated in Figure 1A ) .
Whereas , a low Mg 2 þ condition ( 0.35 mM ) caused a stemloop switching via alternative base pairing between nucleotides 118 -- 125 located in the right arm of stem A , and 140 -- 147 in the left half of stem - loop B , resulting in formation of stemloop C. Stem - loop B is a prerequisite for initiating premature termination of mgtA transcription mediated by the mgtA Mg 2 þ riboswitch ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
The stem - loop C , favoured in low Mg 2 þ , may have prevented formation of stem - loop B , and thus allowed mgtA transcription to be extended into the coding region ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
The E. coli mgtA 5 0 LR also responds to Mg 2 þ similarly as its Salmonella homologue ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
A truncated RNA representing the mgtA 5 0 LR was characterized from E. coli cells ( Kawano et al , 2005 ) , providing direct evidence for premature termination of mgtA transcription in - vivo .
Notably , the truncated transcripts are different in length from in - vivo ( B240 - nt ; Kawano et al , 2005 ) and in - vitro ( 220 - nt ; Cromie et al , 2006 ) samples .
As the mgtA 5 0 LR does not have sequences consistent with a Rho - independent terminator , the 220 - nt transcript is unlikely a product generated in - vitro through transcription termination , but a product from the strong pausing of the RNA polymerase in high Mg 2 þ .
The mechanism of termination or pausing , however , is not known .
It is possible that mgtA transcription is paused at nucleotide 220 , probably by an RNA conformation induced in high Mg 2 þ , and subsequently terminated near nucleotide 240 in - vivo by additional cellular components .

Stem - loop A is critical for Mg 2 þ sensing in the riboswitch because Mg 2 þ - promoted conformational changes in stem - loops B and C depend on the presence of the stem - loop A sequence ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
As the stem - loop A region is transcribed , it might trap the 5 0 LR RNA into distinct structures depending on the Mg 2 þ concentration that ultimately determine whether transcription is prematurely terminated .
Interestingly , a transition mutation in loop A , that substituted nucleotide 98 from C to U , resulted in uncharacteristic expression of Salmonella mgtA in high Mg 2 þ concentrations ( O'Connor et al , 2009 ) .
While the significance of stem - loop A has been implicated , it remained unknown what regulatory element embedded in this region contributed to the 5 0 LR function .
Importantly , previous results suggested that additional cellular factors could have a role in transcriptional regulation of mgtA via the 5 0 LR .
( i ) When transcribed in E. coli , mgtA transcript from Salmonella was degraded more in a high Mg 2 þ condition in an RNase E - dependent manner ( Spinelli et al , 2008 ) .
Mutations at the 5 0 LR eliminated the degradation , suggesting that this nuclease degrades the mgtA mRNA by targeting the 5 0 LR .
( ii ) A transcriptional regulator , Rob , can bind to the Salmonella sequence : 5 0 - accgccaTaattgccacaaa - 3 0 , which includes the PhoP - dependent transcription start ( shown in uppercase ) ( Barchiesi et al , 2008 ) .
When overexpressed , Rob initiates transcription from nucleotide 44 of the 5 0 LR in a PhoP/PhoQ - independent manner .
An Mg 2 þ - responsive RNA element was also characterized in Gram - positive bacteria .
The 5 0 LR of the Mg 2 þ transporter gene , mgtE from Bacillus subtilis , harbours a metal - sensing domain ( M box ) , which is able to bind Mg 2 þ and enhance formation of the downstream Rho - independent terminator 1486 The EMBO Journal VOL 30  NO 8  2011 & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization mgtL translation controls mgtA riboswitch activity GZhaoet al structure ( Dann et al , 2007 ) .
Interestingly , these regulatory RNAs from Gram - negative and Gram - positive bacteria do not share homologous sequences , suggesting that they employ different mechanisms to sense Mg 2 þ and mediate transcription regulation .
In this study , we identify a novel component that controls the regulatory function of the Mg 2 þ riboswitch in mgtA .
Our results demonstrate that the stem - loop A region in the 5 0 LR comprises a translational unit , which encodes the 17 - residue peptide , MgtL , in Salmonella .
We show that Mg 2 þ facilitates modification of the stem - loop A conformation through stem switching to allow mgtL translation from the integral open reading frame ( ORF ) , resulting in premature termination of mgtA transcription .
This mechanism seems to be adopted by the MgtA - type Mg 2 þ transporters in many other Gram - negative species , providing an example in which a small molecule ligand stimulates regulatory function of its cognate riboswitch to initiate premature termination of transcription by coupling translation of a leader peptide .
During the submission of our manuscript , a publication became available online which reported an ORF encoding a putative peptide MgtL in the Salmonella mgtA 5 0 LR presumably responsive to proline ( Park et al , 2010 ) .
While the presence of the mgtL ORF is undisputed , our model of the Mg 2 þ - dependent/proline - independent mgtL translation via a novel stem - loop switch does not support their conclusions .
Results An ORF embedded in the stem - loop A region of the mgtA 5 0 LR To study the regulatory function of stem - loop A , we analysed the phylogenetically conserved sequences from several Gramnegative species that harbour mgtA homologues , including S. typhimurium , E. coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Citrobacter rodentium , Erwinia chrysanthemi , Serratia marcescens , and Yersinia enterocolitica .
These stem - loop A sequences greatly varied , but contained three highly conserved regions that could form an ORF : ( i ) a consensus sequence for ribosomebinding ( SD ) located upstream of a start codon , ( ii ) a start codon , AUG ( GUG in Yersinia ) , and ( iii ) a stop codon , UAA , lying in the same reading frame ( Figure 1B ) .
In Salmonella , this ORF encodes a 17 - residue peptide ( referred to as MgtL , hereafter ) from the start codon 71 AUG 73 , which is located 4 - nt downstream of a putative SD sequence 62 GGAGG 66 , to the stop codon 122 UAA 124 ( Figure 1B ) .
MgtL homologues can also be predicted from stem - loop A sequences of other Gramnegative species ( Figure 1B ) .
MgtL in E. coli , K. pneumoniae , and C. rodentium are also 17 - residue peptides sharing high identity with that in Salmonella ( 70.6 , 76.5 , and 64.7 % , respectively , Figure 1C ) .
On the other hand , MgtL from E. chrysanthemi , S. marcescens , and Y. enterocolitica are shorter peptides , and merely share proline residues at positions 3 and 5 ( amino - acid - residues highlighted in Figure 1C ) , and arginine at the C terminus , as with the peptides from other species .
Regardless of the varied sequence and length in these species , the stop codon UAA is always located at the end of the right arm of stem A ( Figure 1B , except Y. enterocolitica whose UAA is located just before the right arm ) .
The right arm is the switching sequence in the riboswitch structure , that base pairs with alternative sequences to form stem - loop C in low Mg 2 þ and stem - loop A in high Mg 2 þ ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
We presume that this architectural design of the mgtL ORF is important for the regulatory function of the mgtA 5 0 LR .
Similar to our observation , an 18 codon ORF , predicted to encode a peptide whose suggested sequence is the same as MgtL , was identified from Salmonella mgtA 5 0 LR in a recent study ( Park et al , 2010 ) .
Characterization of MgtL peptide encoded by the stem - loop A sequence in Salmonella mgtA 5 0 LR The MgtL peptide is probably either highly unstable or produced at very low levels in the conditions used in this study .
We were unable to detect MgtL peptide expressed from the 5 0 LR in the chromosomal location in - vivo using western blot .
Therefore , we constructed a plasmid , pYS1475 , which carries the full - length mgtA 5 0 LR with an inserted 21 - nt sequence encoding the FLAG - epitope to generate MgtL tagged by FLAG at the N terminus ( hereafter MgtL -- FLAG ; Figure 2A ) .
In this plasmid , the P lac1 6 promoter ( Liu et al , 2004 ) , which is independent of Mg 2 þ and the PhoP/PhoQ system ( Cromie et al , 2006 ; Kong et al , 2008 ) , initiates transcription of the 5 0 LR and a downstream lacZ gene .
Notably , the Rob regulator does not control this transcription because the Rob - binding site is partially deleted in this plasmid ( data not shown ) .
b - Galactosidase activity in wildtype Salmonella harbouring pYS1475 and its parent plasmid pYS1010 ( i.e. , P lac1 6 - mgtA 5 0 LR - lacZ ) ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) grown in N minimal - medium ( Snavely et al , 1989 ) supplemented with 0.01 mM ( low ) Mg 2 þ are 13.3 - and 18 - fold higher than those with 10 mM ( high ) Mg 2 þ , respectively .
This suggests that the engineered mgtA 5 0 LR responds similarly to Mg 2 þ as wild - type 5 0 LR .
Because the Salmonella 5 0 LR can also function in E. coli ( b - galactosidase activity from MC4100 harbouring pYS1010 grown in low Mg 2 þ is B15 - fold higher than in high Mg 2 þ ) , we introduced pYS1475 into an E. coli Maxicell mutant , CSR603 .
MgtL -- FLAG was produced in UV - irradiated bacterial cells in which protein synthesis directed by chromosomal loci , but not by plasmid , was generally inhibited due to extensive degradation of the chromosomal DNA ( Sancar et al , 1979 ) .
Affinity chromatography was carried out to isolate MgtL -- FLAG ( MW 3164 da ) from bacterial cultures grown in low and high Mg 2 þ .
The peptide sample was separated through electrophoresis and a band was detected from the bacterial cells grown in high Mg 2 þ ( Figure 2B ) , which migrated to a position slightly slower than a control peptide , magainin 2 ( MW 2465 da ) .
However , this peptide could not be detected from the bacterial cells grown in low Mg 2 þ , suggesting that MgtL -- FLAG is synthesized only in high Mg 2 þ .
We then carried out a parallel experiment using a plasmid , pYS1475 -- A71C , which carries an A -- C substitution at nucleotide 71 of the 5 0 LR that changes 71 AUG 73 to 71 CUG 73 , resulting in deletion of the start codon .
The MgtL -- FLAG peptide could not be detected from the cells harbouring this plasmid grown in low and high Mg 2 þ ( Figure 2B ) .
Furthermore , when MgtL was overexpressed in a Salmonella wild type harbouring an IPTG - inducible plasmid pUHE - mgtL , we were able to detect an m/z 2171.38 peak in a MALDI - TOF mass spectrum analysis from an eluent derived from bacteria cells grown in the presence of IPTG and 10 mM Mg 2 þ ( Figure 2C , bottom ) .
This peak is specific because it could not be detected from a wild - type cell lysate harbouring control vector ( Figure 2C , top ) .

Premature termination of Salmonella mgtA transcription in high Mg 2 þ is coupled to mgtL translation initiation The observation that mgtL translation and premature termination of mgtA transcription both occur in the 5 0 LR in high Mg 2 þ suggests that these convergent phenomena are coordinated in response to Mg 2 þ .
Thus , we hypothesize that MgtL synthesis is a prerequisite for the premature termination of mgtA transcription .
We constructed a set of pYS1010 derivatives with site - directed substitutions inside the mgtL - coding region ( Figure 3A and C ) , and determined lacZ expression in Salmonella wild - type cells harbouring these plasmids .
In contrast to the result from parental pYS1010 , lacZ expression in cells carrying pYS1010 - A71C , in which MgtL could not be synthesized due to disruption of the start codon ( Figure 2A and B ) remained activated in high Mg 2 þ because b - galactosidase activity was only 1.9 - fold lower in high Mg 2 þ than in low Mg 2 þ ( Figure 3B ) .
On the other hand , lacZ transcription from cells harbouring pYS1010 - A71G , which also carried a substitution at nucleotide 71 , but changed 71 AUG 73 to another start codon 71 GUG 73 ( Figure 3A and C ) , was repressed in high Mg 2 þ because b - galactosidase activity was 12.2 - fold lower when grown in high Mg 2 þ than in low Mg 2 þ ( Figure 3B ) .
To further determine the importance of the start codon , we tested pYS1010 - G73C in which the start codon was disrupted by a substitution at nucleotide 73 ( Figure 3A and C ) .
Comparable to pYS1010 - A71C , b - galactosidase activity from cells with pYS1010 - G73C was only two - fold lower in high Mg 2 þ than in low Mg 2 þ ( Figure 3B ) .
Apparently , if mgtL fails to be translated , high Mg 2 þ is not sufficient to prematurely terminate mgtA transcription .
The 5 0 LR in another plasmid , pYS1010 - G74C , which contains a substitution at nucleotide G74 that changes the second amino - acid from Asp to His without interfering with mgtL translation ( Figure 3A and C ) remained responsive to Mg 2 þ because b - galactosidase activity in high Mg 2 þ was 14.9 - fold lower than in low Mg 2 þ ( Figure 3B ) .
Collectively , these observations demonstrate that mgtL translation is essential for the premature termination of mgtA transcription in high Mg 2 þ .
Disruption of mgtL translation elongation prevents the premature termination of mgtA transcription in high Mg 2 þ We created a stop codon within the mgtL ORF to determine whether interference of its translation elongation could inhibit premature termination of mgtA transcription in high Mg 2 þ .
The plasmid , pYS1010 - G80T , harbours a substitution that replaces the fourth codon , 80 GAA 82 ( Glu ) , with stop codon 80 UAA 82 ( Figure 3A and C ) , in which mgtL translation should be stopped prematurely .
b - Galactosidase activity from cells harbouring this plasmid in high Mg 2 þ was only 1.4 - fold lower than that in low Mg 2 þ ( Figure 3B ) , indicating that mgtA transcription could not be prematurely terminated due to the nonsense point mutation .
Furthermore , a recent study showed that a substitution , C98U , in the mgtA 5 0 LR resulted in mgtA expression in high Mg 2 þ ( O'Connor et al , 2009 ) .
This mutation changes the tenth codon , 98 CGA 100 ( Arg ) , to a stop codon 98 UGA 100 , thus causing a premature stop of mgtL translation at a codon far downstream of 80 GAA 82 ( fourth codon ) .
We constructed a plasmid pYS1010 - C98A , which carried a substitution at the same nucleotide , C98 , and generated a silent mutation ( Figure 3A and C ) and found that b - galactosidase activity was 27.9 - fold lower in high Mg 2 þ than in low Mg 2 þ ( Figure 3B ) , indicating that the 5 0 LR carrying a substitution of C98A , unlike C98U , remained responsive to Mg 2 þ .

( C ) Effect of the substitutions of the mgtL ORF on premature termination of mgtA transcription based on the results from ( B ) .
that the full - length MgtL peptide is detected specifically in high Mg 2 þ ( Figure 2B ) , we propose that mgtL translation should be completed in high Mg 2 þ to prematurely terminate mgtA transcription .
Mg 2 þ concentration modulates a stem switching within stem - loop A that determines conformation of the ribosome - binding site for mgtL translation We synthesized the full - length 264 - nt mgtA 5 0 LR and probed the stem - loop A structure in different Mg 2 þ conditions using dimethyl sulphate ( DMS ) which modifies adenosine , cytidine , and guanosine when located in single - stranded regions .
A primer - extension assay , in which the reverse transcription reaction is disrupted at the modified nucleotides in RNA templates , showed that 62 GGAGG 66 , proposed to be the SD sequence here ( Figure 1B ) , was located in a double - stranded region in low Mg 2 þ , however , in a single - stranded region in high Mg 2 þ ( Figure 4A ) .
The nucleotides G63 and A64 in the SD sequence were modified 2.7 - and 2.4 - fold more in high Mg 2 þ ( 3 mM ) than in low Mg 2 þ ( 0.1 mM ) , respectively ( Figure 4A ) , indicating their locations in a single - stranded region in high Mg 2 þ regardless of simulated base pairs ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
Furthermore , G73 , G74 , C85 , A86 , C96 , and G97 were modified 2.9 - , 2.4 - , 2.6 - , 4.7 - , 2.1 - , and 2.6 - fold more in high Mg 2 þ than in low Mg 2 þ , respectively , implying that they are base paired or protected in a stem ( named D , Figure 1A ) formed in low Mg 2 þ .
Based on these observations , we proposed that the sequence , 91 UCUCC 95 ( named anti - SD ) , can form part of stem D by base pairing with the SD sequence in low Mg 2 þ ; and can alternatively form stem A1 with the sequence , 102 GGAGA 106 ( named antianti - SD ) , in high Mg 2 þ in which the SD site is accessible for mgtL translation ( summarized in Figure 6 ) .
Consistent with this , substitution of the anti - SD sequence in stem A1 with 91 AGAGG 95 enhanced premature transcription termination regardless of Mg 2 þ because b - galactosidase activity in a wild - type strain harbouring this substituted plasmid ( pYS1010 - A1 - sub ) grown in low Mg 2 þ was as low as that in wild - type strain harbouring the wild - type plasmid grown in high Mg 2 þ ( Figure 4B , also see ref .
To determine the role of the anti - SD sequence , we used DMS to map the full - length RNA carrying this substituted sequence .
We found that G63 and A64 in the SD sequence was modified regardless of Mg 2 þ at a similar level as wild type in high Mg 2 þ ( Figure 4C ) , indicating that without the anti - SD sequence , the SD sequence remained single stranded in low and high Mg 2 þ , causing constitutive repression of mgtA transcription likely due to the continuous translation of mgtL .
Introduction of a second substitution to pYS1010 - A1 - sub , which replaced 102 GGAGA 106 with 102 CCUCU 106 to form pYS1010 - A1 - rev , complemented the first substitution by creating a modified stem - loop A1 and restored a wild - type - like response to Mg 2 þ ( Figure 4B , also see ref .
It is likely that 102 CCUCU 106 forms a new anti - SD sequence that base pairs with the SD sequence , thus resulting in inhibition of mgtL translation similar to wild type in low Mg 2 þ ; whereas the 91 AGAGG 95 becomes a new anti - anti - SD sequence in the double substituted 5 0 LR and turns on mgtL translation in high Mg 2 þ .
This was supported by a DMS probing assay using this double substituted full - length RNA in which , like wild - type RNA , the nucleotides G63 and A64 in the SD sequence were protected from DMS modification in low Mg 2 þ ( Figure 4C ) .
Additional mapping of the full - length wild - type RNA with RNase T1 , which cleaves unpaired G residues , revealed that high Mg 2 þ facilitates the accessibility of this nuclease to G65 and G66 located in the SD sequence because they were cleaved 3.4 - fold more in high Mg 2 þ than in low Mg 2 þ ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) , suggesting that the SD site was localized in a single - stranded region in high Mg 2 þ making it more accessible .
In contrast , G105 in the anti - anti - SD sequence was cleaved 3.7 - fold more in low Mg 2 þ than in high Mg 2 þ , implying that it should be located & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30  NO 8  2011 1489 mgtL translation controls mgtA riboswitch activity GZhaoet al in double - stranded region by base paring with the anti - SD sequence in high Mg 2 þ , however , located in a single - stranded region when the anti - SD sequence is switched to form stemloop D in low Mg 2 þ ( Figure 6 ) .
Collectively , these results provide evidence that Mg 2 þ controls the accessibility of the mgtL SD sequence via a stem - loop switching that determines formation of stem - loop A1 and D by which it modulates mgtL translation .
It remains to be investigated how the SD site is modulated in E. chrysanthemi , S. marcescens , and Y. enterocolitica .
Investigation of premature termination of mgtA transcription influenced by amino - acids conserved in the MgtL sequence To determine whether the four Pro residues in Salmonella MgtL sequence ( Figure 1B ) are involved in mgtL translationcoupled transcriptional regulation of mgtA , we constructed four plasmids pYS1010 - C77G , pYS1010 - C83G , pYS1010 - C89G , and pYS1010 - C95G which harbour single substitutions at nucleotides 77 , 83 , 89 , and 95 , respectively , and therefore substitute the individual Pro codons to Ala codons .
b - Galactosidase activity from wild - type cells with the substituted plasmids remained responsive to Mg 2 þ similar to the wild - type plasmid ( Figure 5A ) .
In addition , we constructed a plasmid that replaced the Pro - 3 and Pro - 5 codons , which are conserved in the mgtA 5 0 LRs from various enteric bacteria ( listed in Figure 1C ) , with Ala and found that this double substitution still retained an Mg 2 þ response similar to the wild - type plasmid .
Furthermore , there are three Arg residues in the Salmonella MgtL sequence ( Figure 1B ) .
Therefore , we assayed the function of the 5 0 LR by depleting the amino - acids from the medium in proline and arginine auxotrophs .
It was presumed that reduction of the cytoplasmic concentration of proline or arginine may slow down or prematurely stop mgtL translation due to a possible ribosome stalling and subsequent inhibition of premature termination of mgtA transcription .
However , b - galactosidase activity from the auxotrophs ( constructed using one - step gene disruption strategy ; Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) carrying pYS1010 grown with low and high Mg 2 þ , and 0 and 10 mM proline ( for proC mutant , Deutch et al , 1982 ; YS14029 ) or 10 mM arginine ( for argA mutant , Marvil and Leisinger , 1977 ; YS12014 ) was similar to that from wild - type strain harbouring pYS1010 ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that starvation of these amino - acids does not affect the 5 0 LR - mediated premature termination .
Similar to the results from Salmonella , b - galactosidase activity from E. coli proline auxotrophic mutants , proB ( Smith et al , 1984 ) and proC , as well as arginine auxotrophic mutants , argB ( Parsot et al , 1988 ) and argE ( Meinnel et al , 1992 ) , harbouring pYS1010 was similar to wild type in each Mg 2 þ condition regardless of the proline or arginine concentration ( Supplementary Figure S3D ) .
A recent study compared the level of mgtA mRNA transcribed from its native promoter and proposed that the 5 0 LR could respond to cytoplasmic concentration of proline ( Park et al , 2010 ) .
On the contrary , we found that in high Mg 2 þ without supplemented proline the 5 0 LR - dependent mgtA transcription in the proC mutant was similar to that in wild type ( Figure 5B ) , although the cytoplasmic proline level was much higher in the Salmonella wild type than in the proC mutant ( B3 .7 and 2.4 mmol/g protein , respectively , Figure 5C ) .
When proC mutant was grown in high Mg 2 þ with supplemented proline ( 10 mM ) , which significantly raised the cytoplasmic proline concentration ( from B2 .4 to 3.4 mmol/g protein ) , b - galactosidase activity remained similar to that without proline ( Figure 5B ) .
These results indicate that intracellular proline does not influence 5 0 LR - dependent mgtA expression .
Noteworthy , the proline levels in wild type grown in high Mg 2 þ are actually lower than that grown in low Mg 2 þ , ruling out the possibility that high Mg 2 þ facilitates premature transcription termination by raising the cytoplasmic proline levels to enhance mgtL translation .
Furthermore , we repeated our assays using the conditions in a recent study investigating the proline effect on mgtA transcription ( Park et al , 2010 ) .
In a time ( i.e. , 15 min ) sufficient to see an B7 - fold Mg 2 þ - dependent response of the 5 0 LR - dependent mgtA transcription in wild - type and proC strains , a proline effect was not observed .
In fact , the cytoplasmic proline concentration was lower in the proC mutant than the wild type in all the tested conditions .
Previous results indicate that supplementing proline reduces mgtA - coding mRNA levels within 15 min , we found that this time period is too short for the accumulation of cytoplasmic proline because supplementation of proline can not significantly increase the cytoplasmic concentration ( Supplementary Figure S3C ) .
Thus , we prolonged the incubation for 2 h and found that b - galactosidase activity in the proC mutant supplemented with proline had similar expression levels as wild type grown in low Mg 2 þ without proline supplemented , while the proC mutant expression without proline was significantly reduced ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) due to the significant reduction of colony forming units ( CFUs ) ( Supplementary Figure S3B ) .
Although the cytoplasmic proline levels from cultures grown in low Mg 2 þ with proline supplemented are lower in the proC mutant ( 3.7 mmol/g protein ) than the wild type ( 6.0 mmol/g protein ) , the b - galactosidase activity from both remained similar ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) .
In addition , we constructed two pYS1010 derivatives harbouring substituted Pro codons at three ( 5 , 7 , 9 ) and four ( 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 ) Pro residues , similar to the introduced substitutions at the chromosomal mgtA 5 0 LR in the recent study in which they report a loss Figure 4 Mg 2 þ modifies the secondary structure of stem - loop A in the full - length 264 - nt mgtA 5 0 LR .

Investigation of the mgtL translation - coupled premature termination of mgtA transcription in - vitro Full - length mgtA 5 0 LR is sufficient to direct mgtL translation in - vivo ( Figure 2C ) , but not in - vitro ( data not shown ) .
To explore the possibility that mgtL may be translated from a transcribing mgtA 5 0 LR , we carried out a transcription -- translation - coupled in - vitro reaction using DNA fragments in which the P lac1 6 promoter controls the transcription initiation of the mgtA 5 0 LR .
We detected the full - length transcript ( 264 - nt ) and the truncated transcript ( 220 - nt ) , which was produced at higher levels in high Mg 2 þ ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) similarly as a previous in - vitro - transcription result ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
However , we could not detect the MgtL peptide in this reaction that could detect a truncated LacZ ( B14 .8 kDa ) in low and high Mg 2 þ at similar protein levels using a control DNA fragment with the P lac1 6 - promoted 390 - bp lacZ coding region ( Supplementary Figure S1B ) .
A template containing the P lac1 6 - promoted mgtA 5 0 LR followed by the 390 - bp lacZ coding region could direct synthesis of truncated LacZ at a lower amount from the reaction without supplemented EDTA ( i.e. , high Mg 2 þ ) than that with EDTA ( i.e. , low Mg 2 þ ) , yet , MgtL could not be detected ( Supplementary Figure S1B ) .
The 5 0 LR carrying mutation in the anti - SD sequence ( A1 - sub , 91 -- 95 ) , which resulted in constitutive mgtL translation in - vivo , could produce truncated transcripts , in - vitro , in high Mg 2 þ , similar to wild type ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) .
Thus , it is likely that the in - vitro system allows the 5 0 LR to mediate pausing of the downstream lacZ transcription in high Mg 2 þ , independent of mgtL translation .
As MgtL peptide could not be detected from in - vitro reactions , it is very likely that translation of mgtL requires additional cellular factors .
Discussion AMg 2 þ - dependent translation of leader peptide within a riboswitch is coupled to the premature termination of transcription This study presents an example in which a translational unit comprises an integral part of a riboswitch to mediate premature termination of transcription .
An ORF is characterized within the 5 0 LR of the Salmonella mgtA gene , which encodes a 17 - residue peptide , MgtL .
The mgtL ORF is embedded in stem - loop A region , which has been regarded as the Mg 2 þ - sensing domain in the Mg 2 þ riboswitch ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
We found that this translation occurs specifically in high Mg 2 þ , a condition known to facilitate premature termination of mgtA transcription , thus indicating that high Mg 2 þ should stimulate mgtL translation that triggers this transcription termination .
A typical model of translation - coupled transcription attenuation is the 5 0 LR that harbours a coding region for the 14 - residue TrpL in the E. coli trp operon , which includes two tandem tryptophan codons .
Lack of tryptophan caused the TrpL - translating ribosome to stall due to the uncharged tRNA Trp at the 5 0 LR , which triggers modification of the leader RNA to eliminate a downstream terminator structure ( a review see Henkin and Yanofsky ( 2002 ) ) .
Different from trp regulation ( i ) mgtA transcription will not be prematurely terminated in high Mg 2 þ if mgtL translation is unable to be initiated due to start codon mutations , in which no ribosome can enter the mgtL ORF region ( Figure 3A and B ) ; and ( ii ) cytoplasmic levels of amino - acids present repeatedly in the 1492 The EMBO Journal VOL 30  NO 8  2011 & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization mgtL translation controls mgtA riboswitch activity GZhaoet al RNA structure AUG anti - SD SD A High Mg 2 + Low Mg 2 + STOP A1 anti - anti - SD B AUG SD D STOP anti - SD C signal that determines the mgtL translation , not the mgtL translation that leads to the Mg 2 þ sensing .
That is to say , mgtL translation is an intermediate step that relays the Mg 2 þ signal from the Mg 2 þ - sensor domain to the far downstream region in which the premature termination of mgtA transcription takes place .
Ribosome binding mgtL translation Premature termination of mgtA transcription YES YES YES anti - anti - SD NO NO NO Figure 6 Illustration of the mgtA 5 0 LR conformational changes that influence mgtL translation .
In high Mg 2 þ , the SD site is accessible ( in loop A ) , while the anti - SD and anti - anti - SD sequences are base paired ( in stem A1 ) , resulting in mgtL translation and premature termination of mgtA transcription once translation is completed .
In low Mg 2 þ , the SD sequence is base paired to the anti - SD sequence ( in stem D ) inhibiting mgtL translation .
MgtL sequence , such as proline and arginine , are irrelevant to the regulatory activity of the mgtA 5 0 LR because premature transcription termination takes place similarly in wild - type and isogenic auxotrophs ( Figure 5A -- C ; Supplementary Figure S3A , C , and D ) .
These observations rule out the possibility that a stalled ribosome would be required to induce a specific RNA conformation in order to prevent premature transcription termination .
The mgtL translation has only been detected in - vivo so far , possibly because this intricate process requires additional cellular component ( s ) in the translation system .
An ongoing project was initiated to identify chromosomal loci that are required for mgtL translation in high Mg 2 þ that has led to the identification of a mutant that abrogates premature termination of mgtA transcription in high Mg 2 þ ( data not shown ) .
Mg 2 þ induces a conformation change in the stem - loop A RNA region that determines initiation of mgtL translation Alternative strategy must be adapted for regulation of mgtL translation since ribosome stalling does not appear to prematurely terminate translation .
Our results suggest that mgtL translation is not constitutive , but Mg 2 þ dependent ( Figure 2B and C ) .
mgtL translation unlikely modulates the mgtA 5 0 LR stem switching because , in - vitro , Mg 2 þ is sufficient to induce formation of stem - loops A and B ( in high concentrations ) ; or alternative stem - loop C ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) , and likely stem - loop D ( in low concentrations ) .
According to the model in Figure 6 , we conclude that , in low Mg 2 þ , the SD sequence , 62 GGAGG 66 , is base paired with the anti - SD sequence , 91 UCUCC 95 , to form stem - loop D and prevent access of the ribosome , thus inhibiting translation of MgtL and subsequent premature termination of mgtA transcription .
However , in high Mg 2 þ , along with the formation of stemloop A , the anti - SD sequence base pairs with the anti - anti - SD sequence , 102 GGAGA 106 , to form stem - loop A1 , thus opening the SD site for mgtL translation .
Stem - loop D can not be formed in low Mg 2 þ when the anti - SD sequence is substituted , which leaves the SD site single stranded even in low Mg 2 þ ( Figure 4C ) , resulting in mgtL translation and significantly reduced mgtA transcription ( Figure 4B , and also ref .
Our model suggests that it is the Mg 2 þ A possible role of mgtL translation in the Mg 2 þ riboswitch function Premature termination of mgtA transcription is abrogated in high Mg 2 þ if the ribosome is either absent due to the lack of mgtL translation initiation , or is released early by a nonsense mutation in the mgtL ORF at the fourth codon ( Figure 3B ) or even at the tenth and thirteenth codons located downstream of the four Pro codons ( O'Connor et al , 2009 ; Park et al , 2010 ) .
Thus , it is plausible that completion of mgtL translation is a key step that determines premature termination in high Mg 2 þ .
This is probably the reason why MgtL peptide can only be detected from bacterial cells grown in high Mg 2 þ ( Figure 2B ) .
In addition , mgtA transcription can not be prematurely terminated if the stem - loop B structure is disrupted ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) , suggesting that both mgtL translation and stem - loop B formation are essential for premature transcription termination .
However , it is unlikely that mgtL translation is required for formation of stem - loop B because it can be induced in high Mg 2 þ in - vitro without any protein component ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
Accordingly , these two regulatory elements likely exert their effects simultaneously .
Two possible mechanisms might facilitate premature transcription termination when mgtL translation is completed : ( i ) mgtL translation may bring the ribosome to a position that facilitates termination of mgtA transcription .
This is in a manner comparable to the function of some eukaryotic upstream ORFs ( uORF ) in which the post - translation release of the ribosome subunit ( s ) can cause destabilization of the downstream coding region ( Vilela and McCarthy , 2003 ) .
Thus , the mgtL ORF sequence may provide a ` track ' that , once opened in high Mg 2 þ , allows a ribosome to reach a region to the mgtL stop codon or a far downstream and enables premature transcription termination .
This is why the ribosome has to be introduced by the mgtL translation in cis because a ribosome supplemented in an in - vitro transcription system could not facilitate premature transcription termination in low Mg 2 þ ( Supplementary Figure S1C ) .
The premature termination of transcription takes place at a region far downstream of the mgtL stop codon ( Kawano et al , 2005 ; Cromie et al , 2006 ) .
It has been suggested that high Mg 2 þ reduced the 5 0 LR mgtA transcript stability in an RNase E - dependent manner ( Spinelli et al , 2008 ) .
Furthermore , it is shown that RNase E cleaves the ferric uptake regulator fur mRNA when the ribosome can not initiate translation of the upstream ORF due to its SD site base paired with a trans - acting regulatory RNA RyhB ( Veæerek et al , 2007 ) .
We propose that , in high Mg 2 þ when the cis - acting anti - SD sequence is unpaired to its target , the SD site of mgtL , translation confers a novel function to bring a ribosome on site , probably to interact with stem - loop B , subsequently facilitating RNase E to bind and degrade mgtA 5 0 LR .
( ii ) The MgtL peptide could function as a trans - acting factor and regulate transcription of the mgtA downstream region .
However , the translation machinery , but not the MgtL peptide itself , most likely has a role in premature termination of mgtA & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30  NO 8  2011 1493 mgtL translation controls mgtA riboswitch activity GZhaoet al transcription because the MgtL sequence from various species is not well conserved ( Figure 1C ) , and because MgtL synthesized in trans from a plasmid can not prematurely terminate mgtA transcription in mgtL translation initiation mutants ( i.e. , A71C and G73C ) in high Mg 2 þ ( data not shown ) .
Our conclusions that the Mg 2 þ - dependent synthesis of MgtL is required for premature termination of mgtA transcription contradicts a recent report in which they found that mgtL translation was Mg 2 þ independent ( Park et al , 2010 ) .
Their conclusions , however , are misleading because ( i ) their engineered mgtL -- lacZ fusion contained a deleted mgtL stop codon , which disrupted the stem A required for formation of the Mg 2 þ - sensing domain of the 5 0 LR .
( ii ) Their ` low Mg 2 þ ' condition used to test the mgtL -- lacZ fusion was indeed a high Mg 2 þ condition ( Cromie et al , 2006 ; Cromie and Groisman , 2010 ) and therefore could not be distinguished by the 5 0 LR whose Mg 2 þ sensing had been disrupted anyway .
( iii ) Different from the low - copy number plasmid ( pYS1010 ) that we used to study regulatory function of the mgtA 5 0 LR in which transcription is only regulated by the 5 0 LR , they determined mgtA transcription , particularly its response to proline , from its chromosomal locus , which , in addition to the 5 0 LR ( Cromie et al , 2006 ) , is regulated by at least two independent promoters controlled by PhoP , in response to the extracytoplasmic Mg 2 þ ( Garcia Vescovi et al , 1996 ) and Rob ( Barchiesi et al , 2008 ) .
It is shown that when the 5 0 LR is located in its native chromosomal location , it appears to have an additional regulatory function because the C98T substitution in the 5 0 LR unexpectedly led to constitutive mgtA transcription even in high Mg 2 þ ( O'Connor et al , 2009 ) , in which the transcription initiation is supposed to be repressed by the PhoP/PhoQ system .
This result can not be explained by the premature termination of mgtL translation which takes place after transcription is initiated , simply because transcription initiation does not occur .
( iv ) The regulatory activity of Rob might be changed in altered nutrient conditions they used , such as proline , which should mediate transcription initiated from nucleotide 44 of the 5 0 LR ( Barchiesi et al , 2008 ) .
Their real - time PCR assay can measure the transcripts of the mgtAcoding region , but not the 5 0 LR due to a primer ( Park et al , 2010 ) which corresponds to nucleotides 7 -- 31 of the 5 0 LR absent in Rob - stimulated transcripts , resulting in biased ratios of the 5 0 LR to other RNAs .
In summary , our results suggest a model in which mgtL translation should function as an intermediate to transduce the Mg 2 þ signal from the upstream signal sensing domain to the far downstream effector domain , thus providing an integral component for the riboswitch function to facilitate premature termination of transcription , such as in mgtA , while the Rho - independent terminator and ribozyme structures seem to be absent .
