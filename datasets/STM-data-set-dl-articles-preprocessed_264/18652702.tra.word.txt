Abstract Background : Type 1 fimbriae are the most commonly found fimbrial appendages on the outer membrane of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium .
Previous investigations indicate that static broth culture favours S. Typhimurium to produce type 1 fimbriae , while non - fimbriate bacteria are obtained by growth on solid agar media .
The phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium is the result of the interaction and cooperation of several genes in the fim gene cluster .
Other gene products that may also participate in the regulation of type 1 fimbrial expression remain uncharacterized .
Results : In the present study , transposon insertion mutagenesis was performed on S. Typhimurium to generate a library to screen for those mutants that would exhibit different type 1 fimbrial phenotypes than the parental strain .
Eight - two mutants were obtained from 7,239 clones screened using the yeast agglutination test .
Forty - four mutants produced type 1 fimbriae on both solid agar and static broth media , while none of the other 38 mutants formed type 1 fimbriae in either culture condition .
The flanking sequences of the transposons from 54 mutants were cloned and sequenced .
These mutants can be classified according to the functions or putative functions of the open reading frames disrupted by the transposon .
Our current results indicate that the genetic determinants such as those involved in the fimbrial biogenesis and regulation , global regulators , transporter proteins , prophagederived proteins , and enzymes of different functions , to name a few , may play a role in the regulation of type 1 fimbrial expression in response to solid agar and static broth culture conditions .
A complementation test revealed that transforming a recombinant plasmid possessing the coding sequence of a NAD ( P ) H - flavin reductase gene ubiB restored an ubiB mutant to exhibit the type 1 fimbrial phenotype as its parental strain .
Conclusion : Genetic determinants other than the fim genes may involve in the regulation of type 1 fimbrial expression in S. Typhimurium .
How each gene product may influence type 1 fimbrial expression is an interesting research topic which warrants further investigation .

Salmonella enterica contains more than 2,300 serotypes among which Typhimurium is an important causative agent of gastroenteritis .
Adhesion of bacteria to the host epithelial cells is a prerequisite step in establishing infection .
Specific adhesion requires the interaction of specialized complementary molecules in a ligand - receptor interaction between bacterial surfaces and host tissues [ 2 ] .
Proteinaceous hairlike structures called fimbriae on the surface of bacteria have been implicated in such an event [ 3 ] .
Many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae including Salmonella produce type 1 fimbriae , the most commonly found type of fimbrial appendages [ 4 ] .
Type 1 fimbriae comprise a family of rod - shaped organelles which are 7 nm in diameter and 0.2 -- 2.0 μm long [ 5 ] .
Type 1 fimbriae adhere to different cell types including erythrocytes , leukocytes , intestinal cells , respiratory cells , protozoa , yeast , fungal hyphae , and plant root hairs [ 6 ] .
Several studies indicated that type 1 fimbriae also contribute to virulence [ 7 - 9 ] .
For example , type 1 fimbriae expressing S. Typhimurium caused persistent infection in swine [ 7 ] .
Type 1 fimbriae may also modulate the bacterial tropism to the gut of the host [ 8 ] , and type 1 - fimbriated Salmonella were more virulent than the fim - minus ones [ 9 ] .
The fact that more than 80 % of Salmonella isolates produce this fimbrial type suggests that type 1 fimbriae play an important role at some stage in the life cycle of bacteria [ 10 ] .
Phenotypic variation of the expression of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium was first characterized by Old et al. [ 11,12 ] .
They described a biphasic growth pattern associated with the outgrowth of fimbriate bacteria incubated in static , liquid broth culture .
Briefly , strongly type 1 fimbriate phase S. Typhimurium cells were isolated following serial passage every 48 h in static broth culture .
Non - fimbriate phase bacteria were obtained by growth on solid media .
Current data indicate that the phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium is the result of the interaction and cooperation of several genes in the fim gene cluster [ 13 - 18 ] .
The FimZ transcriptional factor activates the fimA expression by binding to the fimA promoter , and in addition , FimZ also positively regulates its own transcription [ 13 ] .
FimZ requires another co - activator FimY to activate fimA expression , however , no evidence has revealed any interaction of FimY and the fimA promoter [ 19 ] .
Interestingly , fimY gene possesses five rarely used arginine codon which is recognized by an arginine tRNA gene fimU .
A S. Typhimurium fimU mutant did not produce type 1 fimbriae and the fimY translation was inhibited [ 16,17 ] .
fimU modulates the fimY expression in the translational level .
A fimW deleted strain , on the contrary , overproduced type 1 fimbriae as compared to the parental strain .
This negative regulation was proposed to be mediated through an inhibitory effect on the FimZ protein by a FimW - FimZ protein - protein interaction [ 15 ] .
Other than gene products within the fim gene cluster , McFarland et al. recently reported that a knockout mutation in lrp , encoding the leucine - responsive regulatory protein ( LRP ) , was non - fimbriated [ 20 ] .
They demonstrated that LRP positively regulated type 1 fimbrial expression by binding to the promoter region of fimZ [ 20 ] .
Other gene products that may play a role in type 1 fimbrial expression were seldom characterized .
Our longterm goal in the laboratory is focused on finding any genetic determinants , other than those previously described within the fim gene cluster , which may also play a role in the phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium .
Initially we were interested in characterizing the genetic elements that may be associated with the ability of S. Typhimurium to switch type 1 fimbrial expressions in response to solid agar and static broth culture conditions .
We used transposon mutagenesis to generate a library for S. Typhimurium and screened mutants that exhibited different type 1 fimbrial phenotypes than the parental strain between solid agar and static broth culture conditions .
The flanking DNA fragments of the transposon insertion sites in the mutants of interest were cloned and sequenced .
Herein , we report on the genetic determinants in S. Typhimurium that may play a role in the regulation of type 1 fimbrial expression between solid agar and static broth culture conditions .
Results Construction of a transposon mutant library of S. Typhimurium In order to identify any genetic determinant that is responsible for S. Typhimurium to regulate type 1 fimbrial expression between solid agar and static broth cultures , we used a transposon mutagenesis technique to construct a transposon library .
We obtained a library with approximately 8,000 clones .
Screening of S. Typhimurium transposon mutants that exhibited different type 1 fimbrial phenotypes than the parental strain In total , 7,239 transposon mutants were screened for those which exhibited different type 1 fimbrial phenotypes as compared to the parental strain S. Typhimurium LB5010 .
The expression of type 1 fimbriae was determined by yeast agglutination test .
S. Typhimurium LB5010 , when grown in static broth culture for 36 -- 48 h , agglutinated Candida albicans on a glass slide .
These bacterial cells produced type 1 fimbriae on the outer membrane when negatively stained with phosphotungstic - acid and observed under electron microscopy ( Figure 1 , Panel A ) .
On the contrary , S. Typhimurium LB5010 did not aggluti - Page 2 of 14 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2008 , 8:126 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/8/126 Observation of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium LB5010 by electron microscopy Figure 1 Observation of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium LB5010 by electron microscopy .
Panel A. S. Typhimurium LB5010 cells produced type 1 fimbrial appendages on the outer membrane ( arrow ) when cultured in LB static broth at 37 °C for 48 hr ( 20,000 × ) .
Panel B. S. Typhimurium LB5010 cells did not produce type 1 fimbrial appendages on the outer membrane when cultured on LB agar at 37 °C for 18 hr ( 20,000 × ) .
Bacterial cells were negatively stained with 2 % of phosphotungstic - acid .
The annotation of S. Typhimurium LT2 genome is used if the transposon insertion was present in a gene which is uncharacterized and unnamed .

The absence of agglutination correlated with the fact that no type 1 fimbriae were observed by electron microscopy ( Figure 1 , Panel B ) .
Fifty - four mutants verified by Southern blot to have a single unique transposon insertion were selected for further investigation ( Figure 2 ) .
For those strains with multiple transposon insertions ( Figure 2 , lane 6 for example ) were currently excluded from the present study .
This could be due to partial digestion of the genomic DNA or multiple transposons inserted into one bacterial strain .
These 54 mutants no longer exhibited the same type 1 fimbrial phenotype as the parental strain , among which 31 mutants produced type 1 fimbriae in both culture conditions , while another 23 mutants produced type 1 fimbriae in neither culture condition .
The genes inactivated in the mutants were identified by cloning and sequencing the DNA fragments adjacent to the transposon insertion sites .
The DNA sequences were used to search against the genomic sequence of S. Typhimurium .
The position of the transposon insertion site was determined along with whether or not a transposon insertion site was located in or near an open reading frame ( ORF ) , as predicted by the annotated genomic sequences .
In the present study , we only focused on those mutants that demonstrated disruptions in ORFs ; these types of mutation are expected to disrupt the functions of the ORFs involved .
Table 1 lists those mutants .
Transposons which disrupted between ORFs were excluded in the present study .

Page 5 of 14 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2008 , 8:126 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/8/126 Classification of the mutants according to the functions or putative functions of genes disrupted by the transposon insertions The 54 mutants listed in Table 1 were classified according to the functions or putative functions of the ORFs disrupted by the transposons .
We classified the mutants into the 12 categories : fimbrial biosynthesis and regulation , putative cytoplasmic protein , global regulator protein , cell membrane associated protein , cell envelope associated protein , periplasmic protein , ribosome modulation factor , type III secretion system protein , prophage - derived protein , sensor protein , transcription termination factor , and enzymes .
Nine mutants that had defects in fimA , fimC , fimD , fimH , fimY , fimZ , lpfB , pefI , and stbC were placed in the fimbrial biosynthesis and regulation category .
FimA is the major subunit of the type 1 fimbrial shaft , while the adhesion protein , FimH , confers the binding specificity of type 1 fimbriae [ 18,21 ] .
FimC and FimD serve as the chaperone and molecular usher for type 1 fimbriae [ 18 ] .
FimZ and FimY are positive regulators of fimA [ 14,19 ] .
Since all these genes are involved in type 1 fimbrial biosynthesis and regulation , disruption of these genes caused the mutants to produce no fimbriae at all in either culture condition .
Three mutants produced type 1 fimbriae in both culture conditions and had transposons inserted in other fimbrial related genes .
K70 had a defect in lpfB , the chaperone protein for long polar fimbriae [ 22 ] .
K61 had a defect in pefI , which involves the regulation of plasmid - encoded fimbriae [ 23 ] .
K23 had a transposon inserted in stbC that encodes an outer membrane usher protein for Stb fimbriae in S. Typhimurium .
The usher protein facilitates anchoring the developing fimbrial structure to the outer membrane [ 24 ] .
The K1 and K28 mutants exhibited type 1 fimbriae in both static broth and on solid agar media .
The gene products involved are putative cytoplasmic proteins , and their functions remain to be characterized .
The K15 mutant had a transposon inserted in the hupA gene whose product is the histone - like DNA - binding protein , HU , a small , basic , thermostable protein involving DNA replication [ 25 ] .
The K15 mutant and another mutant K46 that has disruption in lrp encoding leucine - responsive regulatory protein ( LRP ) did not exhibit type 1 fimbriae in either culture condition .
Membrane associated proteins possess transmembrane domains .
K17 had interruption of yhjV encoding protein similar to the tryptophan/tyrosine permease family in Escherichia coli [ 26 ] .
The putative protein affected in K39 is a sodium/glucose cotransporter protein which belongs to a superfamily of membrane proteins responsible for the uphill transport of substrates coupled to the downhill transport of Na + [ 27 ] .
The mgtB and narK genes , defective in K72 and K30 respectively , are involved in Mg 2 + and nitrate/nitrite transportation , respectively [ 28 ] .
Disruption of the rmf gene impaired the 70S ribosome dimerization and resulted in inhibition of S. Typhimurium to produce type 1 fimbriae as seen in K56 [ 29 ] .
The ssaB , ssaV , and invB belong to members of the type III secretion system , which is important in the pathogenesis of S. Typhimurium .
The ssaB and ssaV mutants did not produce type 1 fimbriae in either culture condition , whereas the invB mutant produced type 1 fimbriae in both culture conditions .
Two mutants , K11 and K19 , possessed insertions in genes involved in synthesis of putative phage tail proteins [ 30 ] .
K33 had an insertion in the gene encoding for a type III translocated protein , SseI , carried by the prophage Gifsy - 2 [ 31 ] .
Two mutants , K51 and K58 , had transposons inserted into genes which encode the sensor part of the two - component regulatory system .
SsrA is associated with the type III secretion system for the pathogenicity island II [ 32 ] , while YehU in S. Typhimurium remains to be characterized .
NusA binds to the RNA polymerase core enzyme and functions as a transcription termination factor [ 33 ] .
The K73 carrying transposon in nusA did not produce type 1 fimbriae in either culture condition .
Among the mutants , 21 of 54 mutants ( almost 39 % ) were in the category of enzymes comprising the largest group of the mutants .
The enzymes detected in these mutants could be further divided into endoribonuclease ( K3 ) , restriction - modification enzyme ( K5 ) , protease ( K38 ) , tRNA modification enzyme ( K43 ) , the enzyme for lipopolysaccharide synthesis ( K68 ) , and primarily the enzymes required for general metabolism .
Complementation test Table 2 summarizes the results of the complementation test for K3 cafA , K5 res , K43 miaA , K48 ubiB and K73 nusA mutant strains .
The K48 ubiB mutant strain produced type 1 fimbriae constitutively regardless grown in static broth or on solid agar culture condition .
Transforming the plasmid pUbiB that contained the coding sequence of ubiB conferred the K48ubiB mutant to exhibit the type 1 fimbrial phenotype as seen in S. Typhimurium LB5010 .
Transforming a plasmid possessing the coding sequence of res to K5 res mutant did repress the type 1 fimbriae to express on solid agar as the parental strain .
However , the complemented strain did not produce type 1 fimbriae in static broth culture .
The complemented strains K3 cafA ( pCafA ) , K43 miaA ( pMiaA ) and K73 nusA ( pNusA ) remained unchanged as their respective mutant strains , which did not produce type 1 fimbriae in either culture condition .
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) analysis Total RNA from the parental strain S. Typhimurium LB5010 , K48 ubiB mutant , and K48 ubiB ( pUbiB ) were prepared and analyzed for fimA mRNA and 16S rRNA Page 6 of 14 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2008 , 8:126 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/8/126 Table 2 : Phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae by the selected mutant and the complemented strains Strain Plasmid transformed Phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae by bacteria grown on or in a agar broth LB5010 none - + K3 cafA none - - K3 cafA pCafA - - K5 res none + + K5 res pRes - - K43 miaA none - - K43 miaA pMiaA - - K48 ubiB none + + K48 ubiB pUbiB - + K73 nusA none - - K73 nusA pNusA - - a : phenotypic expression of type 1 fimbriae was determined by mannose - sensitive yeast agglutination test .
Figure 3 showed the RT - PCR analysis results .
As for the parental strain LB5010 , the fimA expression obtained from the static broth was approximately 4.5 fold ( 1 : 0.22 ) of that obtained from the agar culture condition .
For the K48 ubiB mutant , expression of fimA ( static broth ) was about 60 % ( 1 : 1.74 ) of the fimA ( agar ) .
When K48 ubiB strain harboured the plasmid pUbiB , fimA expression ( broth ) was about 2.6 fold ( 1 : 0.39 ) of fimA ( agar ) .
As a control , 16S rRNA was constantly expressed in all the strains tested .
Discussion It is not surprising that many bacterial fimbriae have the ability to switch expression from a fimbriate to a non - fimbriate phenotype .
Since bacterial population may face unpredictable milieu during their life cycle , having cells in both fimbriate and non - fimbriate phases offers the bacterial population an advantage of surviving in the diverse situations it will encounter [ 34 ] .
The mechanisms that control the fimbrial regulation have been described in detail for only few fimbrial types .
For example , the regulation in E. coli type 1 fimbriae is primarily controlled by inversion of a 314 - bp segment of DNA ( fim switch region ) upstream of the fimA gene coding for the major fimbrial subunit [ 35 ] .
Accessory proteins including the integration host factor ( IHF ) , LRP and the histone - like nucleoid - structuring ( H - NS ) protein , also bind to the fim switch region to re - orientate the DNA into a configuration favourable for inversion [ 36 - 38 ] .
Interestingly , the E. coli K - 12 strain also possesses the sfm gene cluster ( sfmACDHFZU ) , which is the orthologue of S. Typhimurium fim gene cluster [ 39 ] .
Nevertheless not much characterization has been performed on sfm .
The control system for type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium differs from that of E. coli .
No DNA inversion event has been detected and several fim gene products have been implicated as regulators of type 1 fimbrial expression [ 13 - 18,40 ] .
Previous studies did not reveal that global regulator like IHF or H - NS play a role in S. Typhimurium type 1 fimbrial expression .
In order to explore other elements outside the fim gene cluster that might also participate in type 1 fimbrial expression , we constructed a transposon library of S. Typhimurium .
From the mutants that no longer exhibited the same type 1 fimbrial phenotypes as the parental strain whether grown on solid agar and in static broth cultures , 12 groups were classified according to the putative functions of the genes that were interrupted by the transposons .
Not surprisingly , several mutants that had defects in the fim genes did not produce type1 fimbriae in either condition .
The mutants possessing transposons in fimA , fimC , fimD , fimH , fimZ , and fimY all exhibited the predicted phenotypes .
These fim genes are required for type 1 fimbrial biogenesis or regulation , and disruption of these genes causes the bacteria to be non - fimbriate in either condition .
Interestingly , the present study identified 3 mutants that had defective genes for other fimbrial systems , and they produced type 1 fimbriae in both culture conditions .
K23 had a transposon inserted in stbC that encodes the fimbrial usher protein for Stb fimbriae [ 41 ] .
K70 had insertion in fimbrial chaperone protein for long polar fimbriae ( Lpf ) .
Those two gene products are involved in fimbrial biogenesis .
How disruption of the outer membrane usher gene , stbC , of the Stb fimbrial system affects another fimbrial system poses an interesting research topic .
We did try to complement the stbC mutant with a recombinant plasmid possessing the stbC coding sequence .
However , the stbC mutant exhibited resistance to a battery of antibiotics , including ampicillin and chloramphenicol those frequently used in molecular cloning .
This unexpected finding impeded us to transforming available plasmids into this strain for the time being .
PefI identified in K61 is the homolog of PapI in E. coli .
PefI negatively regulates the production of PefA , the major fimbrial subunit of plasmid - encoded fimbriae ( Pef ) [ 42 ] .

RT - PCR assays were used to monitor fimA and 16S rRNA transcription in the parental strain LB5010 , ubiB mutant , and ubiB ( pUbiB ) strain .
The intensities of the bands for each strain were determined by densitometry and expressed ( Arabic numbers ) relative to the value for fimA transcription obtained from the static LB broth culture condition .
The intensities of 16S rRNA shown indicates that equivalent amounts of total RNA were used in the experiment .
ferent fimbrial systems within the same microorganism has been demonstrated previously .
For example , minor fimbrin of type 1 and F1C fimbriae of E. coli can be reciprocally exchanged to generate hybrid fimbriae with changed receptor specificities [ 43 ] .
The regulator PapB of pyelonephritis - associated pili ( Pap ) prevents inversion of the fim switch controlling the expression of type 1 fimbriae in the same E. coli strain [ 44 ] .
Recently Nuccio et al. also demonstrated that the presence of type 1 fimbrial biosynthesis genes interfered with the expression of plasmid - encoded fimbriae in S. Typhimurium [ 45 ] .
Although additional research is required to elucidate the interaction of different fimbrial systems , our results did stress the observation that different types of fimbriae may coordinate for their own benefit .
A global regulator , LRP , has been demonstrated to play a role in the regulation of both type 1 fimbriae and P fimbriae of E. coli and Pef of S. Typhimurium .
Recently McFarland et al. demonstrated that an lrp knockout S. Typhimurium strain did not produce type 1 fimbriae and Lrp is a positive regulator for fim gene expression by interacting with the fimZ promoter region [ 20 ] .
FimZ is a positive regulator for fimA [ 14 ] .
Their data suggested that a positive contribution of fim gene expression by Lrp/fimZ promoter interaction may be due to the displacement of H - NS , a repressor for fimZ [ 20,46 ] .
The K46 mutant with the transposon inserted into lrp did not produce type 1 fimbriae in either culture condition .
Our result concurred with their finding .
The role that lrp plays in terms of type 1 fimbrial regulation in S. Typhimurium becomes apparent .
Page 8 of 14 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2008 , 8:126 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/8/126 Several S. Typhimurium strains had transposons inserted in the genes that encode enzymes .
The K3 strain had a defect in cafA that encodes a ribonuclease named RNase G in E. coli .
Umitsuki et al. reported that RNase G was involved in the in - vivo degradation of adhE mRNA which encodes a fermentative alcohol dehydrogenase , AdhE [ 47 ] .
A mutation at cafA resulted in accumulation of adhE mRNA and prolonged the half - life of its mRNA .
Interestingly , the K16 strain had a mutation in the gene that encodes alcohol dehydrogenase .
The K16 strain constitutively expressed type 1 fimbriae .
Overexpression of AdhE inhibited type 1 fimbrial expression , while the absence of AdhE caused type 1 fimbrial expression on solid agar or in static broth .
How an enzyme involved in metabolism influences fimbrial expression is not clear , but previous studies demonstrated that type 1 fimbrial expression was linked to the nutrient status of the bacterial encounter .
Broth culture supplemented - with - glucose favours Shigella flexneri remaining in a non - fimbriate state [ 6 ] .
Morgenroth and Duguid described a S. Typhimurium biotype called the FIRN strain ; it is non - type 1 fimbriate , noninositol - fermenting , and non - rhamnose - fermenting [ 48 ] .
The genes controlling fimbrial expression may be linked to the genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism .
Interestingly , similar to the K16 strain , a variety of mutants in the present study having transposons inserted in the genes encoding `` house - keeping '' enzymes all constitutively exhibited type 1 fimbriae .
Barak et al. used transposon mutagenesis to identify genetic determinants required for S. Newport to attach to plant tissue [ 49 ] .
They also found that alcohol dehydrogenase , hydrolase , bacteriophage protein , and several membrane associated proteins , including transporter protein , similar to our findings , were the essential components for this Salmonella serotype to adhere to plant tissue [ 49 ] .
The ability of Salmonella to colonize plant tissue and modulate type 1 fimbrial expression may share a common regulatory network .
A complementation test allowed us to examine if providing the coding sequence of the gene carried in a plasmid back to the mutant stain defective in such a gene would switch the phenotype of type 1 fimbrial expression to that originally observed .
A comprehensive complementation test is not within the scope of the present study ; however , we did test some strains .
The complemented K3 cafA ( pCafA ) , K43 miaA ( pMiaA ) , and K73 nusA ( pNusA ) strains did not exhibit the type 1 fimbrial phenotype as the parental strain .
Polar effect caused by the transposon could be one of the reasons .
Another possibility could be due to the gene dosage effect conferred by the cloning vector .
The K5 res ( pRes ) strain did repress the type 1 fimbrial production on solid agar as the parental strain LB5010 .
However , in static broth culture , the complemented strain did not exhibit type 1 fimbriae .
The res gene , encoding for the restriction subunit of type III restriction - modification ( R - M ) system of S. Typhimurium , locates upstream of the mod gene which encodes the methyltransferase subunit of R - M system .
Since Res subunit requires Mod to form a complex to recognize and cleave DNA [ 50 ] , failure of mod expression caused by polar effect could account for the partially complemented phenotype of the K5res ( pRes ) strain .
NusA is a transcription termination factor and under some circumstance it may also function as a transcription elongation factor [ 51 ] .
The ability of NusA to enhance RNA polymerase pausing would result in tight coupling of transcription and translation , thus interferes with the Rho - mRNA interactions and consequently blocks termination of transcription [ 52 ] .
The transposon inserted in nusA in K73 strain could cause transcription/translation coupling defect in a variety of genes including those that may affect fim expression .
The pNusA transformed in K73 strain may not produce precise stoichiometric ration of NusA , leading K73 nusA ( pNusA ) strain remained unchanged as the K73 nusA strain .
MiaA is an isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase that is required for tRNA modification .
Ericson and Björk demonstrated that a miaA mutant in S. Typhimurium LT2 which was deficient in 2 - methylthio - N6 - ( 4 - hydroxyisopentenyl ) adenosine ( ms 2 io 6 A37 ) in its tRNA induced pleiotropic effects on bacterial physiology such as reduced growth - rate and polypeptide - chain elongation rate [ 53 ] .
Non - fimbriate phenotype exhibited by K43 miaA strain in both culture conditions could be the result of such pleiotropic effects .
The K48 ubiB mutant transformed with the pUbiB plasmid restored the type 1 fimbrial phenotype as the parental strain LB5010 .
The K48 ubiB ( pUbiB ) cultured on agar did not agglutinate yeast cells .
Although signals of both LB5010 and K48 ubiB ( pUbiB ) from agar could be detected by densitometry in RT - PCR assay , we argued that such fimA amount would not be enough for scoring positive in yeast agglutination test .
Our complementation assay did prove that the ubiB mutant could exhibit the same phenotype as LB5010 when it harboured a plasmid containing the coding sequence of ubiB .
The ubiB in S. Typhimurium could encode a NAD ( P ) H - flavin - reductase , whose homologue in E. coli has been proved to be required for the first monooxygenase step in ubiquinone biosynthesis [ 54 ] .
How a gene involving in biosynthesis of ubiquinone , an essential component of electron transport chain influences type 1 fimbrial expression is currently unknown .
However , Leonard et al. reported that UbiB protein contains motifs found in eukaryotic - type protein kinase [ 55 ] .
It was speculated that phosphorylation may be required for ubiquinone biosynthesis - activating proteins [ 55 ] .
Possibly UbiB would also phosphorylate another substrate protein that affects fimA expression .
The function of ubiB in S. Typhimurium and the relationship of ubiB and fim expression demands more careful characterization .
Our data clearly showed that an ubiB mutant produced fimA at the condition that either Page 9 of 14 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2008 , 8:126 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/8/126 favours or inhibits type 1 fimbrial expression and complementing this mutant with a plasmid possessing ubiB coding sequence restored it to the phenotype similar to the parental strain .
The present study revealed that the genetic determinants other than the fim genes could have the potential to affect type 1 fimbrial expression in response to different standard laboratory culture conditions .
However , a battery of genes identified by transposon mutagenesis still requires detail characterization to validate its linkage to fimbrial expression .
The phenotype caused by polar effect is one of the drawbacks in this kind of study .
Validation of the genes of interest that are associated with type 1 fimbrial expression in S. Typhimurium is presently under investigation in our laboratory .
Conclusion The ability to switch between fimbrial expressions in bacteria may be beneficial for survival .
Fimbriate bacteria may facilitate colonizing host cells at certain stages of infection , while non - fimbriate bacteria may also have their own role to play , for example , as in avoiding recognition by phagocytes , or allowing the bacteria to shed and colonize another site on the host .
Compared to E. coli , Salmonella has a higher survival rate in the external environment , which promotes transmission to a new host [ 56 ] .
Persistent infection of Salmonella in the environment is enhanced by adhesion and biofilm formation , both of which involve fimbrial appendages [ 21 ] .
How S. Typhimurium fluctuates between type 1 fimbriate phase and non - fimbriate phase in - vivo remains to be uncovered .
Nonetheless the present study reveals that several genetic determinants may be associated with the ability of S. Typhimurium to modulate type 1 fimbrial expression between solid agar and static broth culture conditions .
These two laboratory culture conditions may to some extent mimic the environmental milieu that Salmonella would encounter .
We report here that other gene products besides those in the fim gene cluster are also required for type 1 fimbrial expression .
How each gene influences type 1 fimbrial expression is an interesting research topic which warrants further investigation .
Methods Bacterial strains , media , culture conditions , primers and plasmids The S. Typhimurium strain used in the present study is S. Typhimurium LB5010 , a LT2 strain derivative [ 57 ] .
This strain produces type 1 fimbriae and is fimbrial phase variable [ 57 ] .
E.coli JM109 strain was used for molecular cloning [ 58 ] .
The primers and plasmids used in the present study are listed in Table 3 and Table 4 , respectively .
Bacteria were grown in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) broth ( Difco/Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) or plated on LB agar [ 59 ] .
Media were supplemented with antibiotics when required at the following concentrations : kanamycin , 50 μg/ml ; ampicillin , 100 μg/ml ; chloramphenicol , 20 μg/ml .
The above antibiotics were obtained from Sigma ( St. Louis , MO ) .
Construction of a transposon mutant library of S. Typhimurium A transposon mutant library of S. Typhimurium was constructed using the EZ : : TN <KAN - 2> Tnp Transposome system ( Epicentre , Madison , WI ) .
This system contains the transposon Tn903 which possesses a kanamycin resistance cassette .
Briefly , 1 μl of the transposome mixture was placed in 40 μl of S. Typhimurium - competent cells and electroporated into the cells for transposition to occur .
The electroporation conditions were set as follows using ECM 630 ( BTX , Pittsburgh , PA ) : voltage of 1.70 kV , resistance of 125 ohms , and capacitance of 50 μF .
Immediately after electroporation , 1 ml of S.O.C medium ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) was added to the cuvette and the medium / cell mixture was transferred to a tube and incubated at 37 °C with constant shaking for 1 h. Four milliliters of LB broth was added to dilute the bacterial cells , and a - 100 μl of aliquot was evenly spread on the kanamycin - containing LB agar .
Screening of S. Typhimurium transposon mutants that exhibited different type 1 fimbrial phenotypes than the parental strain The transformants grown on LB agar supplemented with kanamycin were randomly selected .
Each colony was streaked on LB agar and then inoculated into 10 ml of LB broth .
lected by a sterile loop and resuspended in 100 μl of 1 × phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) .
Cells in the broth medium were collected by centrifugation , and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 1 × PBS .
Subsequently , 30 μl of a 3 % ( vol/vol ) suspension of C.albicans in PBS and an equal amount of bacterial cells to be tested were mixed together on a glass slide [ 11 ] .
Visible agglutination after gentle agitation indicated a positive reaction for the presence of type 1 fimbriae .
Any bacterial suspension that produced type 1 fimbriae was further mixed with C. albicans along with 3 % ( wt/vol ) of a D - mannose solution ( Sigma ) .
The mannose - sensitive agglutination conferred by type 1 fimbriae was inhibited in the presence of mannose .
Southern hybridization Southern hybridization analysis was used to detect the presence of the kanamycin resistance cassette on the S. Typhimurium genomic DNA .
Genomic DNAs from S. Typhimurium LB5010 and the mutant strains that were no longer type 1 fimbrial phase variable were isolated using a MasterPure DNA Purification Kit ( Epicentre ) .
The genomic DNA preparations were cleaved by EcoRI , and the DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 0.7 % agarose gel .
EcoRI was chosen to cut the genomic DNA since there was no EcoRI site within the kanamycin resistance cassette of Tn903 .
A DNA probe derived from the kanamycin resistance cassette sequence was hybridized to one band in the Southern blot if the transposition had occurred only once .
The DNA was soaked in a denaturing solution ( 0.5 M NaOH and 1 M NaCl ) twice for 15 min each time and a neutralization solution ( 3 M NaCl , 0.5 M Tris - HCl ) for 30 min with continuous agitation at room temperature .
The DNA was then transferred onto a nylon membrane by a vacuum blotter ( trans - Vac , Hoefer , San Francisco , CA ) with 10 × SSC and cross - linked to the membrane by exposure to short - wavelength UV light from a UV Spectrolinker ( Spectronics , Westbury , NY ) .
The 1.3 - kb kanamycin resistance cassette - containing DNA fragment was cleaved by Hind III from the pUC4K plasmid and isolated from the agarose gel using a Montage Gel Extraction Kit ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) .
Probe labeling and hybridization were performed using a DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer .
The 1.3 - kb DNA probe was labeled by the randomly primed incorporation of digoxigenin - labeled dUTP .
Briefly , hybridization to the blot was performed at 68 °C in a standard buffer ( 5 × SSC , 0.1 % N - lauroylsarcosine , 0.02 % SDS , and 1 % blocking reagent ) for 16 h. Two 5 - min washes were performed at room temperature in a 2 × SSC ( 1 × SSC is comprised of 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate ) -0.1 % SDS solution .
The blot was then washed with two 15 - min washes in 0.1 × SSC - 0.1 % SDS solutions at 68 °C .
Hybrids were detected using an antibody conjugate ( anti - digoxigeninalkaline phosphate conjugate ) and NBT/BCIP ( 18.75 mg / ml nitrobluetetrazolium chloride and 9.4 mg/ml of a 5 - bromo - 4-chloro - 3-indolyl - phosphate in 67 % [ vol/vol ] DMSO ) solution .
Identification of transposon insertion sites The transposon insertion sites in the mutants of interest were identified by a three - step PCR using a DNA Walking SpeedUp Premix Kit ( Seegene , Seoul , Korea ) .
This kit uses annealing control primer ( ACP ) technology [ 60,61 ] .
The DW - ACP primers provided by the kit are designed to capture unknown target sites , and with primers internal to the known sequence , will amplify DNA fragments possessing the junction region of known and adjacent sequences .
The first PCR reaction was performed independently in four individual PCR tubes using the kan - 5 primer internal to the kanamycin resistance cassette with one of the DW - ACP 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 primers .
The total 50 μl of the PCR contained genomic DNA of the mutant under study , 4 μl of the DW - ACP primer , the kan - 5 primer , distilled water , and 25 μl of 2 × SeeAmp ACP Master Mix II .
The PCR program was set as follows : one cycle at 94 °C for 5 min , 42 °C for 1 min , and 72 °C for 2 min ; followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C 30 s , 55 °C 30 s , and 72 °C for 100 s. Finally the PCR was extended at 72 °C for 7 min .
The product from the first PCR was purified using Montage PCR Filter Units ( Millipore ) and was used as the template for the second PCR .
The second PCR with a final volume of 20 μl contained the first PCR product as the template , 1 μl DW - ACPN , a kanamycin resistance cassette - specific kan - 6 primer upstream from kan - 5 , distilled water , and 10 μl of Page 11 of 14 ( page number not for citation purposes ) BMC Microbiology 2008 , 8:126 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471 - 2180/8/126 2 × SeeAmp ACP Master MixII .
The PCR program was set as follows : denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min ; 35 cycles of 94 °C 30 s , 56 °C 30 s , and 72 °C 100 s ; then the PCR was extended at 72 °C for 7 min .
The third PCR used 2 μl of the second PCR product ( without purification ) as the template .
The remaining components consisted of 1 μl universal primer , 1 μl of the kan - 7 primer upstream from kan - 6 , distilled water , and 10 μl of 2 × SeeAmp ACP Master MixII .
The third PCR reaction consisted of 94 °C for 3 min ; followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s , 60 °C for 30 s , and 72 °C for 100 s ; then the PCR was extended at 72 °C for 7 min .
The products from the third PCR were purified from the agarose gel and sequenced by using the kan - 7 primer to determine the junction sequence where the transposon was inserted into the genomic DNA .
The sequence of the junction region of the transposon was compared against the S. Typhimurium LT2 genome sequence [ GenBank : NC 003197 ] .
Complementation Test Primers used for complementation test ( cafA - F , cafA - R , res - F , res - R , miaA - F , miaA - R , nusA - F , nusA - R , ubiB - F and ubiB - R ) were listed in Table 3 and were used to amplify genomic DNA of S. Typhimurium LB5010 .
The PCR product that contained the full coding sequence of the respective gene was cloned into the yT & A vector ( Yeasten Biotech , Taipei , Taiwan ) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer .
The resulting plasmid was transformed into the corresponding mutant strain by electroporation .
The complemented strains were tested for type 1 fimbrial expression in static broth and on solid agar medium by yeast agglutination test .
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) analysis The bacteria were stabilized by adding RNAprotect bacteria reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) .
Total RNA was prepared by using an RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) and RNasefree DNase ( 1 unit/1 μg RNA ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
RT - PCR was performed using a Fast - Run HotStart RT - PCR ( AMV ) kit ( Protech , Taipei , Taiwan ) .
Briefly , RNA was denatured at 58 °C for 5 min , followed by cDNA synthesis at 42 °C for 30 min and inactivation at 94 °C for 2 min .
The following PCR conditions are : 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s , annealing at 54 °C for 30 s , and extension at 72 °C for 30 s .
An additional extension was performed at 72 °C for 5 min .
