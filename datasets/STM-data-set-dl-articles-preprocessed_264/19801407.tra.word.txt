This system is activated by low Mg 2 , acidic pH , and antimicrobial peptides , but the biological consequences resulting from sensing multiple signals are presently unclear .
Here , we report that the PhoP / PhoQ system regulates different Salmonella genes depending on whether the inducing signal is acidic pH or low Mg 2 .
When Salmonella experiences acidic pH , the PhoP/PhoQ system promotes Fe 2 uptake in a process that requires the response regulator RstA , activating transcription of the Fe 2 transporter gene feoB .
In contrast , the PhoP - induced RstA protein did not promote feoB expression at neutral pH with low Mg 2 .
The PhoP/PhoQ system promotes the expression of the Mg 2 transporter mgtA gene only when activated in bacteria starved for Mg 2 .
This is because mgtA transcription promoted at high Mg 2 concentrations by the acidic - pH - activated PhoP protein failed to reach the mgtA coding region due to the mgtA leader region functioning as a Mg 2 sensor .
Our results show that a single two - component regulatory system can regulate distinct sets of genes in response to different input signals .
Signal transduction mediated by two - component regulatory systems enables bacterial cells to rapidly adapt to and survive various stressful conditions .
The PhoP/PhoQ two - component system is comprised of the response regulator PhoP and the sensor PhoQ .
The PhoQ protein has been demonstrated to sense Mg 2 concentrations as a specific signal ( 14 ) .
When the environmental Mg 2 concentration is lowered to micromolar levels , PhoQ promotes the phosphorylated state of the PhoP protein ( 14 , 32 ) .
In Salmonella enterica , the low - Mg 2 - activated PhoP protein directly regulates the transcription of many genes that are necessary for virulence in mammalian hosts , as well as other physiological processes ( 15 ) .
In particular , consistent with the environment where the system is activated , PhoP/PhoQ allows Salmonella to grow at limited concentrations of Mg 2 ( 14 ) , which results from PhoP - activated expression of the mgtA and mgtB genes , encoding Mg 2 transporters ( 34 ) .
The PhoQ - mediated PhoP phosphorylation also occurs at acidic pH ( 31 ) , and transcription levels of the PhoP - activated genes pagA , phoN , and pmrD increase in Salmonella experiencing acidic conditions ( 3 , 28 , 31 ) .
Taking into account that certain antimicrobial peptides promote the expression of a subset of the PhoP - regulated genes through the PhoP and PhoQ proteins ( 2 ) , the activity of the PhoP/PhoQ system appears to respond to at least three different signals .
The PhoP/PhoQ system also regulates gene expression by controlling the levels and/or activity of other regulators ( 22 ) .

The RstA/RstB two - component system , which consists of a response regulator RstA and its partner sensor RstB , is the one whose expression is regulated by the PhoP/PhoQ system .
In Escherichia coli , the PhoP protein binds to the rstA promoter , and transcription of the rstA gene is repressed by the PhoP / PhoQ system in cells grown at a high concentration of Mg 2 ( 26 ) .
The RstA protein promotes transcription of the asr gene , coding for a product necessary for adaptation to acidic stress ( 27 ) .
Consequently , at acidic pH , transcription of the asr gene is not fully activated in a strain lacking the phoP gene ( 27 ) , due to the reduced levels of the RstA protein .
In addition , the rstA gene has been identified as a multicopy suppressor of the essential genes yjeE , yeaZ , and ygjD ( 5 , 16 ) .
The Salmonella PhoP protein also directly binds to and activates the rstA promoter at low Mg 2 ( Fig. 1 ) ( I. Zwir et al. , unpublished data ) .
We have recently demonstrated that when overexpressed from a plasmid , the RstA protein specifically binds to the feoA promoter and promotes transcription of the feoAB operon encoding the ferrous iron ( Fe 2 ) transporter FeoB ( Fig. 1 ) ( 20 ) .
The PhoP/PhoQ system promotes the expression of the RstA protein when activated at either low Mg 2 or acidic pH ( Fig. 1 ) .
We now report that the RstA protein promotes transcription of the feoB gene exclusively when activated at acidic pH , thereby enhancing the growth of Salmonella in environments with limited iron .
We show that , in contrast to the PhoP - controlled Fe 2 uptake , the expression of the Mg 2 transporter MgtA occurs only when the PhoP/PhoQ system is activated at low Mg 2 .
Thus , depending on the input signals , a single signal transduction system can differentially regulate its target genes .

Plasmid pEN105 expressing the RstA - FLAG protein from the lac promoter was constructed as follows .
The rstA - FLAG gene was amplified by PCR using primers CD - rstA - FLAG - F and CD - rstA - FLAG - R and chromosomal DNA from the DS604 strain .

Model illustrating Fe 2 and Mg 2 uptake regulated by the PhoP/PhoQ system and RstA protein in Salmonella .
( A ) When activated at millimolar Mg 2 concentrations by the acidic - pH signal , the phosphorylated PhoP protein promotes transcription of the rstA and mgtA genes .
The induced RstA protein is activated , possibly by phosphorylation .
The increase in feoB expression resulting from RstA binding to the feoA promoter enhances the FeoB - mediated Fe 2 uptake .
In contrast , mgtA transcription fails to proceed due to Mg 2 binding to the mgtA leader .
( B ) The low - Mg 2 signal activates the PhoP/PhoQ system at neutral pH. Activation of mgtA transcription by phosphorylated PhoP increases production of the full length of the mgtA mRNA , leading to expression of the MgtA protein , which promotes Mg 2 uptake .
In contrast , the RstA protein induced at neutral pH lacks the activity to promote transcription of the feoB gene .

RNA isolation and quantitative real - time reverse transcription - PCR ( qRT - PCR ) analysis .
RNA was isolated from mid - exponential - phase culture ( optical density at 600 nm [ OD 600 ] of 0.5 to 0.6 ) grown in 20 ml of N - minimal - medium .
One - half milliliter of the culture was removed and mixed with 1 ml of RNAprotect bacterial reagent ( Qiagen ) , and RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen ) .
The RNA sample was treated further with RNase - free DNase ( Ambion ) .

The transcription levels of each gene were calculated from a standard curve obtained by PCR with the same primers and serially diluted genomic DNA .
The mRNA levels of target genes were normalized to 16S rRNA levels .
Salmonella strains harboring the rstA - FLAG gene were grown in 20 ml of N - minimal - medium .
When the cells ' OD 600 reached 0.5 , bacterial cells were washed once with phosphate - buffered saline , suspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate - buffered saline , and opened by sonication .
Total protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method .
Whole - cell lysates containing 25 g of total proteins were resolved on 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gels , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes , and analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal anti - FLAG ( Sigma ) or anti - DnaK antibody ( Stressgen ) .
Blots were developed by using horseradish peroxidaselinked anti - mouse immunoglobulin G antibody ( GE Healthcare ) and an ECL detection system ( GE Healthcare ) .
We verified that signals corresponding to the RstA - FLAG proteins were within the linear range of detection by conducting the experiments with cell lysates containing 12.5 , 25 , and 50 g of total protein .
RESULTS The PhoP/PhoQ system promotes RstA expression at similar levels when activated at either low Mg 2 or acidic pH. We explored whether rstA expression could be controlled by acidic pH because low pH also plays a role as a signal activating the PhoP/PhoQ system ( 31 ) .
We isolated RNA from Salmonella strains grown in minimal - medium containing activating ( i.e. , micromolar Mg 2 or acidic pH ) or repressing ( i.e. , neutral pH with millimolar Mg 2 ) signals for the PhoP/PhoQ system .
The results of qRT - PCR revealed that the rstA mRNA levels were threefold higher in the wild - type strain grown at pH 7.7 with 50 M Mg 2 or at pH 5.7 with 2 mM Mg 2 than at pH 7.7 with 2mMMg 2 ( Fig. 2A ) .
This activation was dependent on the PhoP/PhoQ system , because there was no rstA transcription in a strain with the phoPQ operon deleted ( Fig. 2A ) .
In agreement with the transcription data , Western blot analysis using the cell extracts prepared from strains expressing the RstA - FLAG protein from the normal chromosomal location showed the RstA protein in the wild - type strain only following growth in low Mg 2 or acidic pH ( Fig. 2B , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
The RstA protein was hardly detected in the phoPQ deletion mutant , regardless of the Mg 2 concentration and pH value ( Fig. 2B , lanes 5 to 7 ) , or in the wild - type strain that was grown at pH 7.7 with 2 mM Mg 2 ( Fig. 2B , lane 1 ) .
Therefore , the data showed that both the low - Mg 2 and acidic - pH signal can promote RstA expression to similar levels in a process that is dependent on the PhoP/PhoQ two - component system .
The RstA protein , induced at acidic pH by the PhoP/PhoQ system , promotes transcription of the feoB gene .
We have recently reported that overexpression of the RstA protein from a plasmid activates transcription of the feoAB operon encoding the ferrous iron transporter FeoB by direct RstA binding to the FIG. 2 .
The PhoP/PhoQ system activated by acidic pH or low Mg 2 promotes expression of the rstA gene .
Salmonella strains were grown to an OD 600 of 0.5 to 0.6 in N - minimal - medium containing 2 mM ( H , high ) or 50 M ( L , low ) Mg 2 and adjusted to pH 7.7 ( H , high ) or 5.7 ( L , low ) .
( A ) The rstA mRNA levels in wild - type ( 14028s ) and phoPQ deletion ( DS267 ) strains were determined using qRT - PCR .
Shown are the mean values and standard deviations from three independent experiments .
( B ) Western blot analysis of crude extracts prepared from wild - type ( DS604 ) and phoPQ mutant ( EN267 ) strains and probed with anti - FLAG and anti - DnaK antibodies .
Thus , we explored whether the RstA protein induced at low Mg 2 and acidic pH by the PhoP/PhoQ system could promote transcription of the feoB gene .
We determined that , when grown in the presence of 2 mM Mg 2 , the wild - type strain expressed fourfold higher levels of feoB mRNA at pH 5.7 than at pH 7.7 ( Fig. 3A ) .
The feoB activation required the PhoP/PhoQ - dependent RstA protein , because there was no feoB transcription in response to acidic pH in strains with rstA or phoPQ deleted ( Fig. 3A ) .
Transcription of the feoB gene was not activated in the wild - type strain grown at pH 7.7 with 50 M Mg 2 ( Fig. 3A ) .
This is in spite of the fact that Salmonella bacteria experiencing low Mg 2 produced the RstA protein at levels similar to the levels in bacteria grown at acidic pH ( Fig. 2B , lanes 2 and 3 ) .
When both signals were present ( i.e. , low Mg 2 and acidic pH ) , feoB transcription took place in an RstA - and PhoPQ - dependent manner ( Fig. 3A ) .
This result was not due to differences in the RstA protein levels between Salmonella experiencing pH 5.7 with 50 M Mg 2 versus pH 7.7 with 50 MMg 2 ( Fig. 2B , compare lanes 3 and 4 ) .
In sum , our experiments demonstrated that acidic pH can promote feoB transcription in an RstA - dependent fashion , whereas the low - Mg 2 signal is unable to elicit feoB transcription .
The RstB sensor is dispensable for activation of feoB transcription at acidic pH. Because the phosphorylation of a response regulator is primarily mediated by its cognate sensor kinase , we next asked whether the RstB sensor is responsible for the acidic - pH - promoted RstA activity .
However , the RstB protein does not appear to affect feoB transcription because an rstB deletion mutant grown in medium with high ( i.e. , 2 mM ) VOL .
191 , 2009 DIFFERENTIAL REGULATION OF METAL UPTAKE BY PhoP/PhoQ 7177 FIG. 3 .
Activation of feoB transcription at acidic pH is dependent on the PhoP/PhoQ and RstA proteins but independent of the RstB protein .
Wild - type ( WT ; 14028s ) , rstA deletion ( JH101 ) , phoPQ deletion ( DS267 ) , and rstB deletion ( DS603 ) strains were grown in N - minimal - medium at pH 7.7 ( H , high ) or 5.7 ( L , low ) with 2 mM ( H , high ) or 50 M ( L , low ) Mg 2 .
The feoB mRNA levels were determined using qRT - PCR .
Shown are the mean values and standard deviations from three independent experiments .
or low ( i.e. , 50 M ) Mg 2 expressed fourfold higher levels of the feoB mRNA at pH 5.7 than at pH 7.7 ( Fig. 3B ) , just like the wild - type strain .
Thus , our data suggest that phosphorylation of the RstA protein could be mediated by a phosphodonor other than RstB during the growth of Salmonella at acidic pH. Acidic pH promotes RstA activity , possibly via phosphorylation .
The results presented above suggest that the activity of the RstA protein is promoted at acidic pH. To further explore the activation of the RstA protein , we constructed plasmid pEN105 , where expression of the RstA - FLAG protein is under the control of the lac promoter .
Western blot analysis revealed that the rstA deletion strain harboring pEN105 expressed the RstA - FLAG protein only in the presence of isopropyl - - Dthiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) , regardless of the pH of the medium ( Fig. 4A , lanes 2 and 4 ) .
( These RstA - FLAG protein levels were similar to those expressed from a strain with a chromosomal rstA - FLAG gene experiencing acidic pH [ data not shown ] ) .
The feoB mRNA levels were threefold higher in organisms grown at pH 5.7 than in those grown at pH 7.7 ( Fig. 4B ) .
Because the rstA gene is expressed from the lac promoter , these data indicate that RstA activity ( as opposed to RstA level ) is increased in acidic pH. The activation of response regulators usually results in phosphorylation at a conserved aspartic acid residue ( 38 ) .
Thus , we reasoned that RstA phosphorylation might be responsible for the acidic - pH - promoted RstA activity .
To test this idea , we constructed plasmid pEN106 , expressing a mutant form of RstA - FLAG with a single amino - acid substitution in the predicted phosphorylation site ( i.e. , a D52A substitution ) .
We determined that when the rstA deletion strain carrying pEN106 was grown in the presence of IPTG , the feoB mRNA levels were slightly higher at pH 5.7 than at pH 7.7 but failed to reach the threefold difference exhibited by the isogenic strain with the original RstA - FLAG protein ( Fig. 4B ) .
The levels of the mutant RstA - FLAG protein were similar to those of the wildtype RstA - FLAG protein ( Fig. 4A , compare lanes 4 and 8 ) , indicating that the differences in feoB mRNA levels were not due to altered RstA - FLAG amounts .
Cumulatively , these results suggest that the activity of the RstA protein is promoted under acidic pH conditions , possibly via phosphorylation of the FIG. 4 .
RstA - promoted feoB transcription requires the acidic - pH signal and its putative phosphorylation site even when the rstA gene is transcribed from a heterologous promoter .
Plasmids pEN105 [ pRstA ( WT ) ] and pEN106 [ pRstA ( D52A ) ] express the FLAG - tagged wild - type RstA and D52A RstA protein , respectively , from the lac promoter .
Strains were grown in N - minimal - medium containing 2 mM Mg 2 and buffered at pH 7.7 ( H , high ) or 5.7 ( L , low ) in the presence ( ) or absence ( ) of 0.1 mM IPTG .
( A ) Western blot analysis of crude extract prepared from the rstA ( JH101 ) strain harboring pEN105 or pEN106 and probed with anti - FLAG and anti - DnaK antibodies .

conserved aspartic acid which , in turn , activates transcription of the feoB gene .
The PhoQ protein does not affect the activity of the RstA protein at acidic pH. Though it is rare , some response regulators can be phosphorylated by noncognate sensors ( 24 ) .
As RstB was not required for the RstA - promoted transcription of feoB , we wondered whether the PhoQ protein , whose activity is promoted at acidic pH ( 31 ) , might be responsible for activation of the RstA protein at acidic pH. To test this idea , we compared feoB transcription between isogenic phoPQ and phoPQ strains that had the chromosomal copy of the rstA gene deleted and expressed the rstA gene from the lac promoter .
This allowed us to explore the contribution of the PhoP / PhoQ system to RstA activity independently from its role in RstA expression .
We determined that , when RstA protein was induced by IPTG , both the rstA and rstA phoPQ strains displayed 2.8 - fold - higher levels of feoB transcription at pH 5.7 than at pH 7.7 ( Fig. 5A ) , indicating that the PhoP and PhoQ proteins are not required for the acidic - pH - promoted RstA activity .
PhoP * is a variant of the PhoP protein that can promote gene transcription independently of the PhoQ protein ( 7 ) .
Thus , to further assess the participation of the PhoQ protein in RstA activity , we constructed a strain with the phoPQ operon deleted and carrying the pDS303 plasmid expressing the PhoP * protein from the lac promoter .
We determined that the 7178 CHOI ET AL. .
The PhoP/PhoQ system is not required for RstA - promoted feoB transcription at acidic pH. ( A ) feoB mRNA levels produced by the rstA ( JH101 ) and rstA phoPQ ( EN293 ) strains harboring pJH4 , which expresses RstA from the lac promoter .
The strains were grown in N - minimal - medium containing 2 mM Mg 2 and buffered at pH 7.7 ( H , high ) or 5.7 ( L , low ) in the presence of 0.1 mM IPTG .
( B ) rstA and feoB mRNA levels produced by the phoPQ strain ( DS267 ) harboring pDS303 , which expresses the PhoP * protein from the lac promoter .
The strain was grown in N - minimal - medium containing 2 mM Mg 2 and buffered at pH 7.7 ( H , high ) or 5.7 ( L , low ) in the presence ( ) or absence ( ) of 0.5 mM IPTG .
Shown are the mean values and standard deviations from three independent experiments .
IPTG - induced PhoP * protein increased the expression of the rstA gene at both high and low pH ( Fig. 5B ) .
However , activation of feoB transcription was observed only at low pH ( Fig. 5B ) .
Note that the rstA expression levels promoted by the PhoP * protein were similar to those achieved by the low - Mg 2 - or acidic - pH - activated PhoP protein in the wild - type strain ( compare Fig. 2A and 5B ) .
This indicates that the RstA protein was active for feoB transcription in the absence of PhoQ , and it reinforces the notion that the PhoP/PhoQ system only controls the RstA protein levels .
Acidic pH promotes feoB transcription in a strain lacking acetyl phosphate production .
We hypothesized that acetyl phosphate might be necessary for RstA activity at acidic pH because this small molecule serves as a phosphodonor for many response regulators ( 41 ) .
To test this , we determined the feoB transcription levels in a strain with both the ackA and pta genes , encoding the enzymes that are required for acetyl phosphate production , deleted ( 41 ) .
The ackA - pta strain still produced threefold - higher levels of feoB mRNA at pH 5.7 than at pH 7.7 , though the lack of ackA and pta genes slightly reduced the wild - type levels of feoB transcription at acidic pH ( see Fig .
FeoB induction at acidic pH by the PhoP/PhoQ and RstA proteins enhances Salmonella growth upon iron starvation .
( A ) Growth of Salmonella strain ( JH380 ) lacking both the sitABCD and mntH genes in N - minimal - medium at pH 7.7 or 5.7 with 2 mM or 50 M Mg 2 .
( B ) Growth of the JH380 strain and its isogenic feoB ( EN258 ) , rstA ( EN256 ) , and phoPQ ( EN290 ) deletion mutants in N - minimal - medium at pH 5.7 with 2 mM Mg 2 .
All media contained 2 mM sodium ascorbate and 10 M diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid .
The results shown are representative of three experiments .
S1 in the supplemental material ) .
Thus , this result suggests that the RstA protein can be activated at acidic pH in the absence of acetyl phosphate .
Acidic activation of feoB transcription enhances Salmonella growth under iron - depleted conditions .
We previously reported that RstA - promoted expression of the feoAB operon increases Fe 2 uptake in Salmonella ( 20 ) .
Thus , we hypothesized that FeoB expression at acidic pH might contribute to Salmonella 's ability to grow under Fe 2 - depleted conditions .
However , wild - type Salmonella grew equally well in minimal medium that contained sodium ascorbate as an iron - reducing agent and the iron chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid for restriction of Fe 2 and was buffered at pH 7.7 and 5.7 ( data not shown ) .
Because Salmonella can also import Fe 2 using other transporters , such as SitABCD and MntH ( 4 , 23 ) , we reasoned that Fe 2 uptake via these routes might mask the effect of FeoB in our experimental conditions .
Thus , we reevaluated bacterial growth using strain JH380 , which has both the sitABCD and mntH genes deleted .
Upon Fe 2 restriction , strain JH380 grew in the medium at pH 5.7 but not at pH 7.7 , regardless of the Mg 2 concentration ( Fig. 6A ) .
This growth difference is due to FeoB - mediated Fe 2 transport , because deletion of the feoB gene greatly impaired the growth of the JH380 strain in the Fe 2 - depleted medium adjusted to pH 5.7 ( Fig. 6B ) .
Moreover , consistent with the regulatory roles of the PhoP/PhoQ and RstA proteins in promoting feoB transcription ( Fig. 3A ) , deletion of the rstA or phoPQ genes prevented the growth of JH380 experiencing acidic pH and Fe 2 limitation ( Fig. 6B ) .
Cumulatively , these results suggest that activation of the PhoP/PhoQ system and the RstA protein at acidic pH VOL .
191 , 2009 DIFFERENTIAL REGULATION OF METAL UPTAKE BY PhoP/PhoQ 7179 increases FeoB - mediated Fe 2 uptake under iron - restricted conditions .
Iron represses feoB transcription at acidic pH. When bacteria are grown in the presence of iron , the Fur protein associates with Fe 2 to repress transcription of genes involved in iron acquisition ( 1 ) .
Because the feoAB operon is one of the Fur - regulated targets ( 20 , 21 ) , we explored how transcriptional activation of the feoB gene at acidic pH is affected by iron .
On one hand , iron repressed feoB transcription in both the wildtype and the rstA deletion strain , but the effect was much stronger in the wild - type strain , demonstrating the RstA requirement in feoB transcription ( see Fig .
S2 in the supplemental material ) .
On the other hand , deletion of the fur gene allowed feoB expression at acidic pH in both the presence and the absence of iron ( see Fig .
S2 in the supplemental material ) .
The mRNA leader sequence allows expression of the mgtA gene only when the PhoP/PhoQ system is activated at low Mg 2 .
Given that feoB expression was promoted exclusively when the PhoP/PhoQ system was activated at acidic pH ( Fig. 3A ) , we wondered whether there might be a PhoP - dependent gene ( s ) whose expression occurs only at low Mg 2 .
To explore this possibility , we examined transcription of the Mg 2 transporter mgtA gene , which is directly activated by the PhoP protein ( 25 ) .
It has been previously reported that the - galactosidase activity produced by a strain harboring a lacZ fusion within the mgtA coding region was 12 times higher in organisms grown in N - minimal - medium at pH 7.7 with 10 M Mg 2 than in those grown at pH - 5.8 with 10 mM Mg 2 ( 35 ) .
Why is mgtA not being fully expressed despite the acidic - pH activation of the PhoP protein ?
We focused on the recent finding that in response to intracellular Mg 2 levels , the expression of the mgtA gene is controlled by a riboswitch on the leader sequences ( 9 ) .
When Mg 2 concentration attains certain levels in the cytoplasm , Mg 2 binds to the mgtA leader to form a structure that does not favor transcription elongation into the coding region ( 9 ) .
Thus , we hypothesized that mgtA transcription that has been initiated at acidic pH fails to proceed unless cytoplasmic Mg 2 levels are sufficiently low .
To test this idea , we examined mgtA transcription by conducting qRT - PCR with two primer sets , one specific to the coding region and the other targeting the first 100 nucleotides of the mgtA leader ( Fig. 7A ) .
We found that in the wild - type strain , the mgtA leader mRNA levels were 70 - and 140 - fold higher at pH 5.7 with 10 mM Mg 2 and at pH 7.7 without Mg 2 , respectively , than at pH 7.7 with 10 mM Mg 2 ( Fig. 7B ) .
In contrast , the mgtA coding region mRNA level was 1,000 - fold higher at pH 7.7 without Mg 2 but only 6 - fold higher at pH 5.7 with 10 mM Mg 2 than at pH 7.7 with 10 mM Mg 2 ( Fig. 7C ) .
As expected , both low - Mg 2 - and acidic - pH - mediated mgtA induction was greatly impaired in the phoPQ mutant ( Fig. 7B and C ) .
These results suggest that mgtA transcription initiated in cells experiencing acidic pH fails to reach the coding region .
To evaluate the role of the mgtA leader region , we constructed a strain where the sequence corresponding to positions 148 to 247 of the mgtA leader was replaced with the 84 - bp `` scar '' sequence ( 10 ) ( Fig. 7A ) .
This mutation has been previously shown to abolish the Mg 2 - sensing ability of the mgtA leader ( 9 ) .
We determined that the mgtA leader mutant strain expressed the mgtA coding region even at pH 5.7 with 10 mM FIG. 7 .
The leader sequence allows the mgtA gene to be expressed only when Salmonella is starved for Mg 2 .

The doubleheaded arrows marked as `` a '' and `` b '' indicate the regions amplified by qRT - PCR using two pairs of primers .
A part of the leader replaced with the `` scar '' sequence ( 10 ) in strain EN323 is also shown .
( B ) The wild - type Salmonella strain ( 14028s ) and its phoPQ deletion mutant ( DS267 ) , mgtA leader mutant ( EN323 ) , and EN323 with the phoPQ deletion ( EN331 ) were grown to an OD 600 of 0.4 in N - minimal - medium at pH 7.7 with 2 mM Mg 2 and transferred to medium at pH 7.7 or 5.7 in the presence or absence of Mg 2 .
After 30 min , RNA was isolated from the strains , and the levels of mgtA mRNA corresponding to region `` a '' were determined by qRT - PCR .
( C ) By conducting qRT - PCR on the same RNA samples used for the experiment described for panel B , the mgtA transcripts corresponding to region `` b '' were quantified .

Mg 2 at levels that were 53 % of those expressed in organisms grown at pH 7.7 without Mg 2 ( Fig. 7C ) .
This was contrary to the behavior of the wild - type strain grown at pH 5.7 with 10 mM Mg 2 , where the mgtA coding region mRNA level was only 0.5 % of the level produced following growth at pH 7.7 without Mg 2 ( Fig. 7C ) .
The mgtCB operon encodes another Mg 2 transporter , MgtB , whose expression is also determined at the transcription level by the PhoP protein and at the posttranscription level by the leader preceding the first gene in the operon ( 9 , 37 ) .
To examine whether the differential pH and Mg 2 regulation displayed by the mgtA gene also applies to mgtB , we determined the mRNA levels for the mgtB coding region in the wild - type 7180 CHOI ET AL. .
and phoPQ strains experiencing different growth - conditions .
The PhoP - dependent expression of the mgtB gene took place at low Mg 2 but not at acidic pH with high Mg 2 ( see Fig .
S3 in the supplemental material ) , indicating that mgtB transcription can reach the coding region only when intracellular Mg 2 levels are sufficiently low .
Our results suggest that the leader regions allow the MgtA and MgtB proteins to be produced only when Salmonella faces limiting Mg 2 levels , dramatically decreasing the expression of these Mg 2 transporters when the PhoP/PhoQ system is activated by the acidic - pH signal at high Mg 2 concentrations .
DISCUSSION Certain two - component regulatory systems are activated by multiple signals .
For example , the PhoP/PhoQ system is activated when Salmonella is grown in low Mg 2 ( 14 ) , in an acidic pH ( 31 ) , or with certain antimicrobial peptides ( 2 ) .
In the case of the PmrA/PmrB system , both ferric - iron ( 42 ) and acidic pH ( 28 ) promote PmrB activity .
These facts raise the question of whether a single regulatory system controls the expression of distinct sets of genes when activated by different signals .
We have now demonstrated that the acidic - pH activation of the PhoP/PhoQ system promotes transcription of the Fe 2 transporter - encoding gene feoB , whereas its activation by low Mg 2 promotes the expression of the Mg 2 transporter - encoding mgtA gene ( Fig. 1 ) .
Regulation of feoB expression by the PhoP/PhoQ system and the RstA protein .
We demonstrated that the PhoP/PhoQ system promotes the expression of the FeoB Fe 2 transporter when activated by acidic pH but fails to do so when activated at neutral pH by the low - Mg 2 signal ( Fig. 3A ) .
This control requires a second response regulator , RstA , which functions as the direct activator of feoB transcription ( 20 ) .
PhoP binds to the rstA promoter region ( I. Zwir et al. , unpublished ) and activates rstA transcription ( 29 , 30 ) .
Even though the low - Mg 2 and acidic - pH signals can promote the expression of the RstA protein equally well ( Fig. 2 ) , transcription of the RstAdependent feoB gene took place only when bacteria experienced an acidic pH ( Fig. 3A ) .
We propose that acidic pH controls RstA activity via phosphorylation , because the RstA protein expressed from a heterologous promoter activated feoB transcription at pH 5.7 but not at pH 7.7 and because the activation required RstA 's predicted phosphorylation site ( i.e. , D52 ) ( Fig. 4 ) .
Although phosphorylation of a response regulator is generally mediated by its cognate sensor kinase , intriguingly , the acidic - pH activation of feoB transcription still took place in a mutant with a deletion of the rstB gene , which codes for the cognate sensor for RstA ( Fig. 3B ) .
That the RstA protein promoted feoB transcription at acidic pH in the absence of PhoQ ( Fig. 5 ) argues against the possibility of cross - phosphorylation of RstA by the noncognate sensor PhoQ .
In addition , the finding that acidic pH still activates feoB transcription in a strain that does not synthesize acetyl phosphate rules out the possibility of RstA phosphorylation by this small - molecule phosphodonor ( see Fig .
S1 in the supplemental material ) .
Therefore , it is likely that a sensor kinase other than RstB and PhoQ might phosphorylate the RstA protein , because some response regulators are phosphorylated by noncognate sensors ( 24 ) .
Under aerobic conditions at neutral pH , iron is present in an oxidized ferric form .
Consistent with the notion that iron is reduced to a ferrous form under anaerobic conditions , transcription of the feoAB operon increases when E. coli is grown without oxygen ( 21 ) .
What , then , is the biological significance of the pH - regulated feoB expression ?
It has been found that Salmonella possesses extracellular enzyme activities to reduce iron ( 40 ) and that an acidic pH keeps ferrous iron stable in the presence of oxygen ( 6 ) .
Thus , FeoB induction resulting from activation of the PhoP/PhoQ system and RstA protein could enhance Fe 2 uptake in Salmonella growing in acidic environments with limited iron .
In bacterial cells grown with oxygen , cytoplasmic Fe 2 participates in the Fenton reaction and catalyzes the formation of hydroxyl radicals , which causes DNA damage ( 39 ) .
The Fur protein is a primary regulator that senses intracellular Fe 2 levels ( 1 ) .
When associated with Fe 2 , the Fur protein represses the expression of genes for iron acquisition , which minimizes the accumulation of free Fe 2 in the cytoplasm ( 1 , 12 ) .
Not surprisingly , the Fur protein repressed feoB transcription even at acidic pH when iron was plentiful ( see Fig .
S2 in the supplemental material ) .
The PhoP/PhoQ system is also necessary for the survival of Salmonella under Fe 2 - dependent oxidative - stress ( 8 ) .
Although the CorA protein is a Mg 2 transporter , it has been reported to import Fe 2 as well ( 17 ) .
When aerobically grown at low Mg 2 , aSalmonella phoP mutant displayed increased Fe 2 accumulation in a process dependent on the CorA protein ( 8 ) .
The finding that neither the expression level of the CorA protein nor its membrane location is affected by the PhoP protein implies the presence of a PhoP - regulated gene product ( s ) regulating CorA activity ( 8 ) .
Indeed , the phoP mutant was hypersensitive to Fe 2 - dependent oxidative - stressmediated killing , which was rescued by inactivation of the corA gene ( 8 ) .
Taking these findings together , the PhoP/PhoQ system is likely to play dual roles in iron homeostasis : PhoP enhances Fe 2 uptake when iron is scarce at acidic pH , whereas downregulation of CorA activity at low Mg 2 protects Salmonella from Fe 2 - mediated killing .
Salmonella imports Mg 2 via three transporters : CorA , MgtA , and MgtB ( 18 , 19 , 33 ) .
The corA gene is constitutively expressed ( 8 ) , whereas transcription of the mgtA and mgtB genes is directly activated by the PhoP protein ( 25 , 43 ) .
As opposed to the PhoP - controlled Fe 2 uptake at acidic pH , we determined that MgtA expression takes place only at low Mg 2 ( Fig. 7 ) .
This is because the mgtA leader functions as an RNA sensor ( 9 ) such that when the cytoplasmic Mg 2 concentration reaches a certain high level , Mg 2 binds to the mgtA leader to form a structure that prevents RNA polymerase from proceeding to the mgtA coding region ( 9 ) .
The full - length transcript , including the mgtA coding region , is produced when intracellular Mg 2 is low enough to promote the formation of a different structure in the leader region ( 9 ) .
