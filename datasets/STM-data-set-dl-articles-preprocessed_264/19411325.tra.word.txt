Using the AcrAB - TolC system as a paradigm multidrug - resistant efflux pump and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium as a model pathogen , we have demonstrated that AcrA , AcrB , and TolC are each required for efficient adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells and macrophages by Salmonella in - vitro .
In addition , AcrB and TolC are necessary for Salmonella to colonize poultry .
Mutants lacking acrA , acrB , ortolC showed differential expression of major operons and proteins involved in pathogenesis .
These included chemotaxis and motility genes , including cheWY and flgLMK and 14 Salmonella pathogenicity island ( SPI ) -1 - encoded type III secretion system genes , including sopE , and associated effector proteins .
Reverse transcription - PCR confirmed these data for identical mutants in two other S. Typhimurium backgrounds .
Western blotting showed reduced production of SipA , SipB , and SipC .
The absence of AcrB or TolC also caused widespread repression of chemotaxis and motility genes in these mutants , and for acrB : : aph , this was associated with decreased motility .
For mutants lacking a functional acrA or acrB gene , the nap and nir operons were repressed , and both mutants grew poorly in anaerobic conditions .
All phenotypes were restored to that of the wild type by trans - complementation with the wild - type allele of the respective inactivated gene .
These data explain how mutants lacking a component of AcrAB - TolC are attenuated and that this phenotype is a result of decreased expression of numerous genes encoding proteins involved in pathogenicity .
The link between antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity establishes the AcrAB - TolC system as fundamental to the biology of Salmonella .
The AcrAB - TolC efflux system is a tripartite complex and is a member of the resistance - nodulation - division ( RND ) family .
It is considered the major efflux system of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae .
InEscherichia coli and Salmonella enterica , AcrAB - TolC confers innate resistance to a wide range of toxic - substances , including antibiotics , dyes , disinfectants ( biocides ) , and detergents ( 5 , 8 , 13 , 26 , 27 , 29 ) .
An intact AcrAB - TolC system is also required for the development of high - level , clinically relevant , resistance to numerous agents , including the fluoroquinolones ( 11 , 30 , 38 ) .
Clinical isolates of multidrug - resistant ( MDR ) E. coli and S. enterica commonly overproduce AcrAB - TolC ( 6 , 18 , 35 , 46 , 47 ) .

AcrAB - TolC found in pseudomonads , Campylobacter spp. , and Borrelia burgdorferi , also confer innate MDR and , when overproduced , clinically relevant levels of antibiotic resistance .
In addition to exporting antibiotics , RND efflux pumps can confer innate resistance to natural substances produced by the host , including bile , hormones , and host defense molecules ( 33 ) .
Efflux pumps of this family are also required for the colonization , and persistence , of bacteria in the host -- whether they be plants , animals , or human ( 34 , 35 , 45 ) .
The mechanisms underpinning this contribution to pathogenesis of RND pumps are not currently well understood .
We previously demonstrated that AcrB and TolC are each required for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 to colonize and persist in poultry ( 8 ) .
One explanation proposed for the attenuation of mutants of S. Typhimurium lacking an intact AcrAB - TolC system is that this system is required for growth in the presence of natural detergents , such as the bile found in the chicken intestinal environment .
However , this does not explain the inability of the TolC mutant to adhere to ( and both the AcrB and TolC mutants to poorly invade ) INT - 401 and RAW - 264.7 tissue culture cell lines in - vitro ( 8 ) .
Most recently , we have shown that inactivation of acrA also reduces invasion of INT - 401 and RAW - 264.7 cells by S. Typhimurium ( Blair et al. , personal communication ) .
Nishino et al. ( 29 ) found that S. Typhimurium strain ATCC 14028 mutants lacking tolC or acrAB were attenuated in their ability to kill BALB/c mice .
191 , 2009 SALMONELLA EFFLUX PUMPS AND VIRULENCE 4277 Control of expression of acrAB is complex and can occur at a local level ( mediated by the repressor acrR ) and via global regulators .
There is no clear pattern of the hierarchy of regulation of acrAB , although the transcriptional regulators MarA and SoxS can affect expression of these genes ( 36 , 41 , 49 ) .
Although absent in E. coli and Shigella spp. , S. Typhimurium and some other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae also contain an additional AraC - XylS family regulatory gene , ramA .
This gene is overproduced in laboratory mutants and MDR clinical and veterinary isolates , whereas overexpression of marA and soxS is rarely observed ( 1 , 18 , 35 ) .
In order to better understand the contribution of RND efflux pumps to pathogenicity , we used the AcrAB - TolC system as a paradigm MDR efflux pump and S. Typhimurium as a model pathogen .
We investigated the effect of inactivation of acrA , acrB , or tolC on the transcriptome , secretion of virulenceassociated proteins , and other virulence - associated attributes of S. Typhimurium .
Our data indicate that several systems involved in conferring the ability of S. enterica to be pathogenic are repressed in mutants in which acrA , acrB , or tolC are inactivated , explaining the attenuation of these strains .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains .
S. Typhimurium SL1344 was used as a control strain for all S. enterica experiments ( 51 ) .
Mutants of SL1344 lacking a functional acrA , acrB , or tolC gene as a result of insertional activation have been described previously and shown to be nonpolar mutants ( 8 ) .
E. coli O78 and its derivative lacking a functional tolC were constructed using the method of Datsenko and Wanner ( 10 ) , as described previously ( 8 ) .
The acrA : : aph mutant still expresses acrB , allowing the results of inactivating each component of AcrAB - TolC to be studied in isolation ( Blair , personal communication ) .
The mutant acrA : : aph , acrB : : aph , and tolC : : aph alleles were transferred into 14028s and L3 ( 35 ) by P22 transduction as previously described and verified by PCR .
Complementation of mutants was as previously described , using low copy number vector pWSK30 ( 8 ) .
We have previously shown that there are no statistically significant differences between the generation times of all strains during logarithmic phase growth in LB or MOPS ( morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ) minimal - medium , indicating that the growth - rate of mutants lacking a functional acrA , acrB , ortolC gene was not impaired or enhanced ( see file S1 in the supplemental material ) ( 3 ) .
Likewise , total cellular protein ( after overnight growth ) was not higher in the mutants than in SL1344 .
No overgrowth was seen for any strain in any media ( see file S2 in the supplemental material ) .
The growth kinetics of the E. coli O78 tolC : : aph mutant and the S. Typhimurium 14028S acrAB mutant ( 29 ) were also the same as those of their respective parental strains ( data not shown ) .
Growth kinetics of mutants , complemented strains , and SL1344 were investigated by determining absorbance using a spectrophotometer , by viable counts , and by total protein estimation , as described by Yang et al. ( 52 ) .
Growth kinetics in anaerobic conditions were performed using 10 - ml volumes of MOPS minimal - medium with glucose in sterile universal tubes ( Teknova , United States ) supplemented with 400 mg/liter histidine overlaid with 10 ml of sterile mineral oil .
These tubes were then inoculated with 500 l of an overnight culture of the test strain and grown at 37 °C over 24 h , and then the optical density ( OD ) was measured .
Growth data were obtained in three separate experiments , each containing three technical replicates .
RNA preparation and transcriptional analyses .
RNA was prepared from strains after inoculation of 24 ml of defined MOPS minimal - medium ( Teknova , United States ) with 1 ml of overnight culture grown in Luria - Bertani broth .
Previously , we established that growth in this medium allows changes in the expression of acrAB and tolC to be identified easily and more accurately than growth in undefined rich media ( 4 ) .
SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 were expressed under these conditions .
Broths were incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm .
All cultures were grown in sterile 500 - ml Erlenmeyer flasks .
When the cultures had reached an OD at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) of 0.7 ( 0.02 ) , 4 ml of culture was added to 1 ml of 5 % phenol and 95 % ethanol in a 50 - ml falcon tube and incubated on ice for 1 h. Cells were then harvested , and RNA was prepared using the Promega SV40 total RNA preparation kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
The quantity and quality of RNA was determined using a Bioanalyser ( Agilent ) .
Transcriptomic experiments used the pan - Salmonella generation IV microarray at the Sanger Genome Campus ( Hinxton , United Kingdom ) .
For microarray experiments , three cultures were grown for each strain , and two RNA preparations made from each culture , giving a total of six test and six reference samples ( three biological and two technical replicates of each ) .
RNA ( 25 g ) was used to generate probes labeled with either Cy - 3 or Cy - 5 using Superscript III ( Invitrogen , United Kingdom ) .
For each microarray experiment , wild - type ( SL1344 ) RNA was pooled after quantification to provide a common reference .
For each microarray experiment , six slides were hybridized with labeled probes , three with SL1344 labeled with Cy - 3 and the test strain labeled with Cy - 5 and three dye swaps .
Hybridization and scanning were as described previously ( 12 ) .
Results were analyzed using Bioconductor ( 37 ) .
B values ( log odds value of 0 , and P 0.05 ) of 0.05 were taken as significant .
All results have been deposited in Array Express .
Comparative reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR was used to validate microarray data and determine the expression of genes of interest in different genetic backgrounds , as previously described ( 13 ) .
Primers used to amplify target genes were CheMF , CGCCAATTTCATTACGTCCT ; CheMR , TGCCCTGCTTAAC CCATTAG ; FlgMF , GCCGTTTTTAATGCTTCGAC ; FlgMR , GCATTGACC GTACCTCACCT ; NirDF , GTGGCAAAACATCTGCAAAA ; NirDR , CGCT ATGGTAAGGACGGAAA ; SipAF , CGGTCGTACCGGCTTTATTA ; SipAR , CAGACGGCAGAGATTGTGAA ; SipCF , GCTAATTTGCTGCTCGGAAC ; and SipCR , CCATGGATATGACCCGAATC .
16S rRNA and ramA primers were as previously described ( 13 ) .
All PCRs used 30 cycles of 30 s each and an annealing temperature of 51 °C .
Data were obtained in three separate experiments , each containing three technical replicates .
All data were analyzed with Student 's t test ; P values of 0.05 were taken as significant .
Protein purification and Western blotting .
Western blotting was performed essentially as described previously ( 24 ) .
Strains were grown overnight in Luria - Bertani broth at 25 °C , with shaking at 100 rpm .
The next morning 4 ml of this culture was used to inoculate 36 ml of sterile Luria - Bertani broth prewarmed to 37 °C , and cultures were incubated at 37 °C , with shaking at 150 rpm .
Once cultures reached an OD 600 of 1 ( 0.2 ) , the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation , and supernatants were removed and purified in 50 - ml falcon tubes using low - protein binding filters ( Millipore PVDF , 0.45 m ) .
To each preparation , trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10 % , and the preparations were stored on ice for 1 h .
After this period , the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min to pellet proteins .
Supernatants were discarded , and proteins were resuspended in 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate and transferred into Eppendorf tubes .
Samples were centrifuged again and resuspended in 1 ml of acetone at 70 °C overnight .
After this incubation the tubes were spun again at 10,000 g for 10 min , supernatants discarded , and pellets resuspended in 1 LDS loading buffer ( Invitrogen , United Kingdom ) before being stored at 20 °C until required .
For preparation of secreted proteins , the cell growth procedure was the same as that followed for RNA extractions prior to the microarray experiments .
For blotting , 5 l and 0.5 l of preparations obtained from cells grown in minimal or Luria - Bertani medium were separated , respectively , on 4 to 12 % Bis - Tris gels ( Invitrogen , United Kingdom ) .
All antibodies used were monoclonal and mouse derived ( courtesy of Ed Galyov , Institute for Animal Health ) and were used at 1 g/ml .
Magic Mark XP ( Invitrogen ) was used as a marker in all gels .
The ability of mutants to migrate through ( swimming ) or across ( swarming ) semisolid agar was determined by making agar plates based on MOPS minimal - medium ( Teknova ) supplemented with either 0.25 , 0.3 , or 0.5 % ( wt/vol ) agar .
Plates were inoculated by stabbing them with a sterile loop and incubated at 30 °C over 5 days , and zones of migration through the agar were measured for each strain daily .
Data were obtained in four separate experiments , each containing two technical replicates .
All data were analyzed with a Student t test ; P values of 0.05 were taken as significant .
Microarray data accession numbers .
The microarray data were deposited in the Array Express database under the following accession numbers : E - MEXP - 1832 ( SL1344 acrA : : aph ) , E - MEXP - 1981 ( SL1344 acrB : : aph ) , and E - MEXP - 1982 ( SL1344 tolC : : aph ) .
RESULTS Disruption of acrA results in differential transcription of 115 genes , including genes encoding proteins involved in pathogenicity .

significant ( log odds value of 0 and P 0.05 ) altered expression of 115 genes ( 3 % of the SL1344 genome ) ( see file S3 in the supplemental material ) ; 54 genes ( 47 % ) were increased in expression relative to SL1344 , and 61 ( 53 % ) were decreased .
The gene with the greatest increase ( 6.7 - fold ) was lysC , responsible for initiation of lysine biosynthesis .
Compared to the parental strain , SL1344 , there was increased expression of genes that encode proteins important to Salmonella infecting and/or colonizing its host .
These included chemotaxis genes , flagellum genes , and anaerobic metabolism genes ( Table 1 ) .
There was also decreased expression of genes that encode TABLE 2 .

proteins involved in pathogenicity .
These included several genes within SPI - 2 and genes involved in anaerobic respiration ( Table 2 ) .
RT - PCR of six genes representing the various clusters confirmed the pattern of significantly differential gene expressions revealed in the microarrays , although the changes revealed by RT - PCR were significantly lower than those indicated by the microarray data in some cases ( Fig. 1 ) .
Furthermore , RT - PCR revealed that when the mutation in acrA was complemented in trans ( SL1344 acrA : : aph , pWKS30acrA ) expression of these genes was the same as that in SL1344 ( Fig. 2 ) .
The transcriptomic data were also interrogated for expression of genes encoding efflux or membrane proteins that could compensate for the loss of AcrA .
Expression of homologues of acrA ( acrE , mdtA , macA , aaeA , STM0352 , and STM0818 ) ; acrB ( acrD , acrF , mdtB , mdtC , and STM0351 ) ; genes encoding the outer membrane porin proteins , OmpC and OmpF ; and those encoding members of the OMP85 family encoding important outer membrane proteins YfgL , YfiO , NlpB , and SmpA ( 48 ) was not acrA dependent .
Disruption of acrB resulted in differential expressions of 569 genes , including genes encoding proteins involved in pathogenicity .
Transcriptomic comparison of L110 ( acrB : : aph ) and SL1344 showed that disruption of acrB caused significant ( log odds value of 0 and P 0.05 ) altered expression of 569 genes ( 13 % of the genome ; see file S4 in the supplemental material ) ; 203 genes ( 36 % ) were increased in response to acrB inactivation .
Interestingly , there was relatively little overlap ( Fig. 3 ) between the AcrA - and AcrB - dependent genes which showed significantly increased expression , with only 9 of the 203 ( 4 % ) VOL .

genes being both AcrA and AcrB dependent .
The gene with the greatest AcrB - dependent increase in expression ( 1,200 - fold ) was ramA , previously associated with MDR in S. enterica and recently shown to bind upstream of acrAB and tolC ( 26 ) .
Eight of the 20 most highly AcrB - dependent genes were putative or hypothetical genes without known functions .
The expression of the global regulator of transcription , fis , was also increased ( Table 1 ) .
The expression of 366 ( 64 % ) genes was significantly decreased as a result of acrB inactivation .
Again , there was little overlap with the AcrA - dependent genes ; only 16 of the 366 ( 4 % ) genes were significantly decreased in expression when acrA or acrB was inactivated .
Compared with SL1344 , decreased expression of several clusters of genes that encode proteins involved in pathogenicity was seen with the acrB mutant .
These genes included sipABCD , invBJ , and prgHJI ; the effector genes encoding the proteins SopE and SopE2 ; genes involved in anaerobic respiration , napABC , napF , narGHIJK , and nirBC ; genes involved in chemotaxis and motility , including flgCDEFGJLMLN , cheRMWY , and tar ; and adhesion genes fimA , fimC , and fimI .
RT - PCR of representative genes of these clusters confirmed the gene expression changes seen in the microarray experiments .
Complementation of acrB in trans restored gene expression to levels similar to those seen for the parental strain SL1344 ( Fig. 2 ) .
In contrast to L884 ( acrA : : aph ) , there was no differential expression of genes in SPI - 2 in L110 ( acrB : : aph ) .
In addition , while there was differential expression of anaerobic respiration genes in both the AcrA and the AcrB mutants , expression was increased in the former and decreased in the latter .
Inactivation of acrB had no effect on the expression of the genes encoding the most homologous transporters to AcrB , AcrD , and AcrF or of the genes encoding members of the OMP85 family .
Expression of genes encoding OmpF and OmpX was decreased 4 - fold and 1.4 - fold , respectively .
Of the genes encoding periplasmic stress proteins , only expression of ppiB was decreased .
Of the genes encoding general stress proteins , cpx expression was decreased and E ( rpoE ) was expressed considerably less than it was in SL1344 .
Complementation of expression of genes altered in mutants .
Expression of ramA ( open boxes ) , cheM ( gray boxes ) , nirD ( boxes with horizontal lines ) , sipC ( boxes with vertical lines ) , flgM ( boxes with diagonal lines ) , sipA ( black boxes ) was measured in SL1344 and L773 ( L110 pKSW30acrB ) , L774 ( L109 pKSW30tolC ) , and L989 ( L884 pKSW30acrA ) .
Expression was measured by comparative RT - PCR , and results are shown as change relative to SL1344 .
Loss of tolC resulted in differential expression of 171 genes , including genes encoding proteins involved in pathogenicity .
Far fewer genes were TolC dependent than were AcrB dependent , with altered expression of 171 genes ( 4 % of genome ) significantly ( log odds value of 0 and P 0.05 ) different from those in SL1344 ( see file S5 in the supplemental material ) .
Fifty - nine genes ( 35 % ) showed increased expression in L109 ( tolC : : aph ) .
As found for the acrB disruptant , the transcriptional activator ramA was overexpressed in SL1344 tolC : : aph .
Of the 59 genes with increased expression , 27 have not been annotated or have a hypothetical function .
Thirty - seven of the 59 ( 63 % ) genes upregulated in L109 ( tolC : : aph ) were also AcrB dependent for expression .
However , there was only one gene dependent upon TolC and AcrA , SL1968 , which encodes a putative prophage protein specific to SL1344 .
There was significantly ( log odds value of 0 and P 0.05 ) decreased expression of 112 genes after disruption of tolC .
Of these , 96 were also significantly decreased in expression in L110 ( acrB : : aph ) .
The TolC - and AcrB - dependent genes included chemotaxis and motility genes , including cheWY and flgLMK , and 14 SPI - 1 genes , including sopE and sopE2 ( Table 1 ) .
There was no altered expression of genes in SPI - 2 .
Four of the 112 ( 4 % ) TolC - dependent genes were also significantly decreased in expression in L884 ( acrA : : aph ) .
Comparison of transcriptomes of the acrA , acrB , and tolC mutants .
Venn diagram showing overlap of genes with significantly altered ( increased or decreased ) expression in L884 ( acrA : : aph ) , L110 ( acrB : : aph ) , and L109 ( tolC : : aph ) compared with SL1344 .
Regulators with altered expression in each group are indicated .
Bold type indicates genes with increased expression ; lightface type those with decreased expression .
191 , 2009 SALMONELLA EFFLUX PUMPS AND VIRULENCE 4281 acrB was significantly reduced in L109 ( tolC : : aph ) , whereas expression of acrA was unaffected .
The expression of genes encoding other annotated or putative outer membrane efflux proteins ( including genes encoding homologues of TolC ) and the OMP85 family of S. Typhimurium was the same as in SL1344 .
However , expression of ompF and ompX was TolC dependent .
No gene was expressed at significantly higher levels in all three mutants , and only four genes in all three mutants were expressed at significantly lower levels than those of SL1344 .
These were yaeE ( an ABC transporter permease ) , STM1698 ( a hypothetical protein ) , dmsB ( dimethyl sulfoxide reductase ) , and glpB ( an anerobic glycerol hydrogenase ) .
These data indicate that inactivation of acrA , acrB , and tolC has very different effects on the transcriptome of S. Typhimurium .
Expression of known regulators , including those of SPI - 1 , is altered as a result of inactivation of acrB or tolC .
As SPI - 1 gene expression was decreased in the AcrB and TolC mutants , the transcriptomic data were interrogated for expression of various genes known to influence regulation of SPI - 1 ( Table 1 ) .
Expression of the major regulator of SPI - 1 , hilA , was not significantly affected in any of the mutants .
The major activators of SPI - 1 transcription , invF and hilC , were significantly downregulated in both L110 ( acrB : : aph ) and L109 ( tolC : : aph ) .
The expression of fis , which encodes a DNA binding protein known to positively regulate expression of hilA and invF ( 25 ) , was increased in L110 ( acrB : : aph ) only .
A variety of genes are known to be able to influence expression of acrAB and tolC .
Of these , there was no AcrA - , AcrB - or TolC - dependent expression of acrR , marRA , orsoxRS .
However , expression of rob was decreased in the AcrB mutant .
ramA and ompR were overexpressed in response to inactivation of acrB or tolC .
Expression of the flagellum anti - sigma factor flgM was decreased in L110 ( acrB : : aph ) .
flhD expression was also decreased in L110 ( acrB : : aph ) .
Expression changes seen after inactivation of components of AcrAB - TolC are similar in different strains of S. Typhimurium .
To confirm the accuracy of the transcriptomic data and that the expression changes seen as a result of disruption of AcrAB - TolC were not specific to the SL1344 background , the mutant acrA , acrB , and tolC alleles were transduced from L884 ( acrA : : aph ) , L110 ( acrB : : aph ) , and L109 ( tolC : : aph ) into two other wild - type strains of serovar Typhimurium , 14028s and L3 ( human isolate ) .
Comparative RT - PCR was used to measure expression of sipA , sipC , cheM , flgM , nirD , and ramA in the nine mutants compared with that in the respective parental strains .
Irrespective of the strain of S. Typhimurium , disruption of acrA , acrB , ortolC conferred altered expression of these six genes and mirrored the changes of expression observed in the transcriptomic data sets .
These data indicate that data obtained for SL1344 are typical of this serovar ( Fig. 1 ) .
Furthermore complementation of the mutant acrA , acrB , and tolC alleles in the different strain backgrounds restored expression of all genes tested to levels not significantly different from that in SL1344 ( Fig. 2 ) .
Secretion of SipA , SipB , and SipC is reduced in mutants lacking components of AcrAB - TolC .
One striking finding of the transcriptional analyses was that expression of genes known to be involved in pathogenesis was significantly decreased when FIG. 4 .
Production of SPI - 1 proteins .
Western blot of SipB and SipC of protein supernatants prepared from L884 ( acrA : : aph ) , L110 ( acrB : : aph ) , and L109 ( tolC : : aph ) grown in minimal media .
acrB or tolC was inactivated .
Therefore , production of the secreted SPI - 1 proteins , SipA , SipB , and SipC , by each mutant was analyzed by Western blotting .
Culture supernatants were prepared from cells grown in minimal - medium in order to replicate the growth - conditions of the transcriptomic experiments .
Data from Western blotting were in agreement with the transcriptomic data , with significantly reduced amounts of SipB and SipC detected in both L109 ( tolC : : aph ) and L110 ( acrB : : aph ) .
Consistent with the transcriptomic data , secretion of these proteins was not significantly reduced in L884 ( acrA : : aph ) ( Fig. 4 ) .
After growth of L109 ( tolC : : aph ) in minimal medium , too little of SipA was produced to be detected ; however , significantly less SipA was observed with extracts from cells grown to late logarithmic phase in Luria - Bertani medium compared to SipA in SL1344 ( data not shown ) .
Mutants lacking acrB showed reduced motility .
As genes involved in chemotaxis and motility were decreased in expression in both L110 ( acrB : : aph ) and L109 ( tolC : : aph ) , the ability of each strain to migrate through or over semisolid agar was evaluated .
All strains retained the ability to `` swim '' and `` swarm .
'' Only L110 ( acrB : : aph ) showed a significant ( P 0.05 ) loss in motility .
This strain was significantly less motile than SL1344 on minimal agar for all three concentrations tested , indicating a reduced ability to both swim and swarm ( Fig. 5 ) .
Electron micrographs indicated that all mutants have morphologies similar to that of SL1344 , but fewer flagella were visible in preparations of L110 ( acrB : : aph ) ( data not shown ) .
L110 ( acrB : : aph ) and L884 ( acrA : : aph ) are compromised in their ability to grow anaerobically .
Expression of genes in the nir , nar , and nap operons encoding genes involved in anaerobic respiration was reduced in L110 ( acrB : : aph ) and increased in L884 ( acrA : : aph ) .
However , the ability of both these mutants to grow in anaerobic conditions was impaired compared to the ability of SL1344 ( Fig. 6 ) after 8 and 24 h. L109 ( tolC : : aph ) did not show altered expression of genes involved in anaerobic respiration , and its anaerobic - growth was not significantly different from SL1344 under anaerobic conditions .

Interrogation of published data for the effect of environmental conditions on growth in tissue culture cells upon expression of acrA or tolC .
The AcrAB - TolC system contributes to a variety of phenotypes , including pathogenicity in S. Typhimurium , and data presented herein indicate that this may be due to repression of several regulons that influence expression of genes known to be important in pathogenicity .
The acrAB and tolC genes are among the most highly expressed genes of S. Typhimurium , and chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray experiments have shown RNA polymerase bound tightly to the acrAB locus ( 22 ) .
Expression of acrAB and tolC is relatively stable under different environmental conditions in vitro ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether expression of acrA or tolC is regulated during the pathogenesis of S. Typhimurium , transcriptomic data previously obtained for SL1344 under diverse conditions ( 19 , 22 , 44 ) were analyzed for changes in expression of acrA and tolC ( acrB was not present on the microarray used in these experiments ) .
In LB media , both acrA and tolC were produced at maximal levels during the early logarithmic phase , and expression of both genes was increased by 4.5 - fold at 37 °C compared to that at 25 °C ( 31 ) .
In LB medium , expression of acrA can be induced by polymyxin ( 2 ) , whereas in the presence of hydrogen - peroxide , expression of acrA was decreased threefold .
Expression of tolC was decreased 10 - fold after growth in macrophages ( J774 ) ( 17 ) and 5 - fold after growth in HeLa epithelial cells ( 19 ) .
Neither acrA or tolC was regulated by the nucleoid - associated proteins H - NS ( 31 ) , IHF ( 9 , 23 ) , or Fis ( 20 ) or the RNA chaperone protein Hfq ( 40 ) .
A number of regulatory genes are known to be able to influence the expression of genes involved in pathogenicity or defense against host - derived factors of S. Typhimurium ; these include the two - component phoPQ ( 53 ) and pmrAB ( 42 ) systems ( involved in sensing the transition to an intracellular location and defense against host peptides ) and the regulators of SPI - 1 , invF ( 9 ) , hilC ( sprA ) ( 14 ) , and hilA ( 43 ) , and of SPI - 2 , ssrA ( 39 ) , as well as global regulators , including fis ( 7 , 50 ) and hns ( 28 ) .
Of these regulatory genes , only one ( invF ) had decreased expression when acrB or tolC was inactivated ( Table 1 ) .
In addition , in L110 ( acrB : : aph ) , there was decreased expression of pmrA and pmrB compared with that in SL1344 .
This mutant also had increased expression of fis .

the available transcriptomic data and literature for these systems identified that phoPQ is postulated to regulate tolC ( 53 ) , although phoPQ expression was unchanged in SL1344 tolC : : aph .
There are currently no data indicating that the other systems directly influence expression of acrAB or tolC .
DISCUSSION While it has been shown that inactivation of RND family efflux systems can confer attenuation in the host , there is little evidence of how these systems are involved in pathogenesis .
The present study sought to explore the cause of the observed attenuation in mutants of S. enterica , each lacking a component of the AcrAB - TolC system , using total genome transcriptional analyses to guide biological experiments .
The transcriptomic experiments in this study revealed that in response to inactivation of acrA , acrB , or tolC there were considerable gene expression changes .
These included genes related to the ability of the mutants to infect the host , as well as those that could compensate for loss of AcrA , AcrB , or TolC ( i.e. , efflux pumps or outer membrane proteins and regulators thereof ) .
The transcriptomic , confirmatory RT - PCRs and Western blotting data demonstrated a general repression of SPI - 1 in S. Typhimurium , resulting from inactivation of acrB or tolC , and repression of SPI - 2 after inactivation of acrA , demonstrating that this phenomenon is not restricted to SL1344 .
SPI - 1 is required for subversion of the host cells ' cytoskeletal machinery by S. Typhimurium , which leads to ruffle formation and uptake of S. Typhimurium into host cells .
A previous study by Morgan et al. ( 25 ) used signature - tagged mutagenesis to identify genes required for colonization of chicks and cattle .
In their study , the disruption of SPI - 1 genes resulted in only a minor defect in the ability of SL1344 to colonize 2 - week - old chicks ; however , deletion of sopE2 resulted in a colonization defect .
In this transcriptomic study , decreased expression of sopE2 , as well as SPI - 1 genes , was observed with both L109 ( tolC : : aph ) and L110 ( acrB : : aph ) .
Other systems are also required during the pathogenesis process ; the ability to grow anaerobically was impaired in L110 ( acrB : : aph ) , which may negatively impact the ability of this mutant to survive in the VOL .

Motility is also important in the pathogenesis of S. Typhimurium ( 21 ) , and L110 ( acrB : : aph ) was less motile than SL1344 .
Therefore , we postulate that the inability of mutants lacking a functional AcrAB - TolC system to invade tissue culture cells or to colonize chicks is due to decreased expression of specific genes encoding proteins conferring the ability to infect the host ; these include the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes and other genes which contribute to the ability of S. Typhimurium to survive in - vivo and attach to host cells .
It is likely that the observed decreased expression of SPI - 1 is mediated , in part , by the decreased expression of invF seen with all mutants , as invF has been shown to be required for expression of various SPI - 1 genes ( 9 ) .
Recently it has been demonstrated ( 32 ) that inactivation of the magnesium transporter corA in S. Typhimurium results in attenuation in the mouse infection model .
Deletion of corA also resulted in varied changes to the transcriptome of S. Typhimurium , including repression of SPI - 1 , SPI - 2 , and motility - associated genes .
This pattern is similar to the results observed here , although examination of the data reveals no obvious regulatory link between the two studies .
It is possible that deletion of corA and of acrAB and tolC perturbs a common but currently unrecognized regulatory network .
Virlogeux - Payant et al. ( 45 ) recently reported that inactivation of tolC led to decreased expression of SPI - 1 genes , which is in agreement with our data .
However , in contrast to data presented herein , they reported that inactivation of acrB did not lead to a decrease in SPI - 1 expression in the isolates they tested .
They also previously reported that AcrB is not required for colonization of chickens by S. Typhimurium ( 5 ) .
One possible explanation for the difference between these data is that we used SL1344 mutants ( this study and reference 8 ) and Baucheron et al. used various isolates of DT104 and DT204 .
In order to address this , the mutant alleles of acrA , acrB , and tolC were transduced into two additional strains of S. Typhimurium , 14028s and a human clinical isolate , L3 ; data very similar to those from the SL1344 mutants were obtained .
In addition , 14028s acrAB : : Cm administered by the oral route was attenuated in mice ( 29 ) .
These data indicate that the data obtained for SL1344 mutants are not specific to this background alone .
The discrepancies seen with DT104 and DT204 do , however , suggest that while TolC would appear to influence expression of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 in all strains tested to date , AcrB has a similar effect in some strains but not all .
A role for AcrB in pathogenicity is , however , further supported by data showing that homologues of this protein are also required for other bacterial species to colonize and/or infect their host ( 34 ) .
While there were similarities and differences between the transcriptomes of all three mutants , there was much greater overlap between the transcriptomes of L109 ( tolC : : aph ) and L110 ( acrB : : aph ) , particularly among those genes with decreased expression .
These data may explain similarities in phenotypes between these mutants ; however , there are also distinct phenotypic differences .
For instance , mutants lacking tolC are unable to adhere to cells in tissue culture ; in contrast , mutants lacking acrA and acrB can adhere but are poorly invasive ( 8 ) .
It has been postulated that disruption of AcrAB - TolC and in particular TolC ( an important structural component of the cell envelope of the members of Enterobacteriaceae ) confers membrane instability and that this may confer the observed attenuation .
However , there were no gene expression changes indicative of membrane stress seen with any of the mutants , including no alteration in expression of genes encoding Omp85 family proteins , shown to be required for assembly of numerous outer membrane proteins ( 48 ) .
This may have been anticipated if loss of AcrAB - TolC had a nonspecific effect on membrane stability .
It is currently unclear why mutants lacking tolC are more attenuated than those lacking acrA or acrB but is perhaps simply due to the more promiscuous nature of TolC .
For instance , TolC interacts with several other proteins ( e.g. , AcrEF and MacAB ) , and its loss also impacts upon export of substrates by those systems as well as those of AcrAB .
In addition , in S. Typhimurium lack of MacAB also confers attenuation ( 29 ) .
When combined with inactivation of acrAB and macAB the bacterium is severely disabled .
AcrA has also been shown to be promiscuous ( 15 , 16 ) and can interact with AcrD , it is conceivable that homologues of AcrA , such as AcrE , may be similarly able to bind to AcrB and TolC and complement the effects of inactivation of acrA to some extent .
We , and others , recently showed that ramA regulates expression of acrB ( 12 , 31 ) and that ramA itself is regulated by ramR ( 1 ) .
Data presented herein indicate that expression of ramA is also responsive to inactivation of acrB and tolC but not acrA.It is hypothesized that in L110 ( acrB : : aph ) and L109 ( tolC : : aph ) , ramA expression is increased in response to a lack of expression of the inactivated genes .
One explanation for this is that an inducer of ramA ( either a metabolic product usually exported via AcrAB - TolC or a component of the media used in our studies ) is a substrate of AcrAB - TolC and that deletion of acrB and tolC results in accumulation of this inducer and increased expression of ramA .
Although inactivation of acrA , acrB , ortolC conferred gene expression changes upon known regulators of genes that encode proteins involved in infecting the host , the mechanism by which these changes are mediated is unclear .
With the exception of PhoPQ , recently shown to be able to regulate tolC in E. coli ( 53 ) , there is currently no known regulatory network which includes both acrB and tolC and regulators of pathogenesis .
Some of the conditions known to be relevant to the ability of S. enterica to be pathogenic , such as pH and temperature , also influence expression of acrA and tolC .
This may suggest that undescribed regulatory mechanisms that control expression of acrB and tolC are also involved in controlling genes that confer pathogenicity .
In conclusion , transcriptomic and biological data presented herein indicate that the attenuation of S. Typhimurium lacking AcrB or TolC is a result of decreased expression of many genes involved in the pathogenic process , including those required for anaerobic - growth , motility , and host cell invasion , particularly SPI - 1 .
These results are likely to be applicable to related species for which RND pumps have also been shown to contribute to pathogenicity , and these results may represent a general effect in which large numbers of genes are dependent on the presence of a functional major efflux system for expression .
The link between innate MDR and pathogenicity establishes RND efflux pumps and the AcrAB - TolC system in particular as fundamental to the biology of the organism .
