Isberg , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Tufts University School of Medicine , Boston , MA , and approved November 4 , 2011 ( received for review June 2 , 2011 ) Sensing and adapting to the environment is one strategy by which bacteria attempt to maximize fitness in an unpredictable world ; another is the stochastic generation of phenotypically distinct subgroups within a genetically clonal population .
In culture , Salmonella Typhimurium populations are bistable for the expression of flagellin .
We report that YdiV controls this expression pattern by preventing transcription of the sigma factor that recruits RNA polymerase to the flagellin promoter .
Bistability ensues when the sigma factor is repressed in a subpopulation of cells , resulting in two phenotypes : flagellin expressors and flagellin nonexpressors .
Although the ability to swim is presumably a critical survival trait , flagellin activates eukaryotic defense pathways , and Salmonella restrict the production of flagellin during systemic infection .
Salmonella mutants lacking YdiV are unable to fully repress flagellin at systemic sites , rendering them vulnerable to caspase - 1 mediated colonization restriction .
Thus , a regulatory mechanism producing bistability also impacts Salmonella virulence .
nongenetic variation  pyroptosis  bet - hedging  fliC  pathogenesis Deterministic adaptation in response to environmental signals is a common and well - characterized strategy by which bacteria endure changing external conditions .
Another strategy is bethedging , in the form of stochastically generated , phenotypically distinct subgroups within a genetically clonal population ( 1 ) .
Diversity may improve the chance that a clone will thrive in a fluctuating environment .
In some cases , deterministic adaptation and stochastic survival strategies are integrated .
For example , as a population of Bacillus subtilis enters the stationary - phase , the probability that a subgroup of cells will become competent increases in response to environmental cues ( 2 ) .
The presence of two stable phenotypes within a genetically clonal population , under homogenous conditions , is termed bistability ( 1 ) .
When the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is grown under homogenous conditions in rich media , transcription of the flagellin monomer fliC is bistable , with well - defined subpopulations of fliC - OFF and fliC - ON cells ( 3 ) .
In this organism , a three - class transcriptional cascade orders the production of flagellar proteins ( 4 ) .
Class I genes encode a transcriptional activation complex that is required for class II expression ; class II proteins include the sigma factor ( σ 28 , produced from the fliA gene ) that recruits RNA polymerase to class III promoters , including the fliC promoter .
Flagellar gene expression is controlled by environmental signals , and WT Salmonella strains capable of causing systemic infection regulate the production of flagellin in a host compartment - specific manner ( 3 ) .
During oral infection of mice , the pathogen breaches the mucosal layer of the gut , colonizes the lymphoid tissue ( Peyer 's patches ) ( 5 ) , and finally establishes a niche within phagocytic cells that ferry the organism to the spleen and other systemic tissues ( 6 , 7 ) .
Salmonella transcribe fliC within the Peyer 's patches ; however , fliC is not expressed at systemic sites ( 3 ) .
Salmonella reside within macrophages in - vivo ( 6 ) and can translocate flagellin into the cytosol of host cells via the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) type III secretion system ( 8 ) .
Macrophages interpret intracytosolic flagellin as a danger signal , and initiate the proinflammatory cell death program pyroptosis in response ( 9 , 10 ) .
Pyroptosis depends on expression of caspase - 1 and is characterized by the maturation and release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL - 1β and IL - 18 and lysis of the macrophage .
Mice deficient in caspase - 1 , IL - 1β , or IL - 18 are more susceptible to systemic Salmonella infection than WT mice , underscoring the importance of this pathway to host resistance ( 11 , 12 ) .
Therefore , the down - regulation of flagellin in systemic tissues may prevent host cell death and inflammation .
In many bacterial species , motility is regulated by GGDEF and EAL domain proteins ( 13 ) .
We hypothesized that members of this protein family would regulate Salmonella flagellar genes in - vivo .
Here we show that an EAL - like protein , YdiV , represses fliC transcription in a subpopulation of cells in culture , producing bistability .
YdiV also represses flagellar genes in systemic tissues , thereby protecting Salmonella from caspase - 1 -- mediated bacterial clearance .
We demonstrate that ydiV controls phenotypic heterogeneity in - vitro and in - vivo and modulates Salmonella virulence .
Results EAL - Like Protein YdiV Suppresses the Inflammatory Capacity of Salmonella .
PFAM ( 14 ) and homology searches were used to identify the full complement of genes encoding GGDEF and EAL domain proteins in Salmonella ( Fig .
S1 and SI Materials and Methods ) .
A targeted deletion was constructed in each gene , yielding a panel of 22 mutant strains .
To identify GGDEF and EAL domain proteins that control Salmonella interactions with host phagocytes , murine bone marrow - derived macrophages were infected with individual mutants , and macrophage lysis was measured by lactate dehydrogenase release .
We hypothesized that this screen would enable us to identify mutants with altered virulence .
Twenty - one of the mutations had no effect on the ability of the bacteria to kill macrophages , but deletion of ydiV significantly increased the cytotoxicity of Salmonella ( Fig. 1A ) .
ΔydiV is on average 2.16 times more cytotoxic than WT , as noted by Hisert et al. ( 15 ) .
Enhanced killing by ΔydiV was accompanied by accelerated release of mature IL - 1β , an endogenous substrate of caspase - 1 , into the supernatant ( Fig. 1B ) .
After 20 min , ΔydiVinfected macrophages released 6.2 - fold more mature IL - 1β into the supernatant than WT - infected macrophages as determined by densitometry ( Fig. 1B ) .
Release of mature IL - 1β by macrophages was dependent on caspase - 1 ( Fig .

An EAL domain protein modulates cytotoxicity by repressing fliC .
( A ) A panel of 22 GGDEF/EAL domain mutants was screened for the ability to trigger pyroptosis of bone marrow - derived macrophages .
Macrophages were infected for 90 min at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 .
Only ΔydiV ( STM1344 ) was significantly more cytotoxic than WT Salmonella ( P < 0.05 ) .
Error bars represent the SD of two independent experiments .
( B ) Macrophages infected with ΔydiV ( MOI = 12 ) release mature IL - 1β into the supernatant more rapidly than macrophages infected with WT ( MOI = 14 ) .
Values were determined using densitometry as described in Materials and Methods .
Uninfected and ΔsipB ( noncytotoxic control ; MOI = 11 ) samples were collected at 40 min .
( C ) Hypercytotoxicity of ΔydiV is dependent on fliC .
Dashed lines represent strains in which the ΔfliC mutation was complemented .
( D ) ΔydiV overexpresses FliC .
WT and ΔydiV cultures were grown to exponential phase in LB and evaluated by Western blot analysis .
Four independent samples of each strain are shown .
FliC expression was normalized to the DnaK loading control .
Overexpression of FliC Accounts for the Hypercytotoxicity of the ΔydiV Mutant .
Because FliC triggers macrophage pyroptosis ( 9 , 10 ) , excess FliC expression could account for the enhanced cytotoxicity of ΔydiV .
Accordingly , fliC deletions were engineered into the ΔydiV and WT backgrounds .
Both the ΔfliC and ΔydiV ΔfliC mutants killed poorly compared with the WT and ΔydiV parent strains , demonstrating the contribution of flagellin to cytotoxicity in both backgrounds ( Fig. 1C ) .
Reintroduction of FliC completely restored the hypercytotoxic phenotype characteristic of the ΔydiV parent strain .
Western blot analysis confirmed that ΔydiV cultures contained 14.15 times more FliC protein than WT ( average WT FliC : DnaK ratio , 0.465 ; average ΔydiV FliC : DnaK ratio , 6.578 ) ( Fig. 1D ) .
Taken together , these results demonstrate that YdiV represses fliC , and that the overproduction of flagellin by ΔydiV stimulates macrophage pyroptosis and cytokine production .
YdiV Controls the Heterogeneity of fliA Transcription .
Transcription of fliC in WT Salmonella is bistable ( 3 ) .
To evaluate whether YdiV regulates bistability , fliC transcription was examined in single cells using a chromosomally integrated reporter construct in which expression of GFP was driven from the fliC promoter ( PfliC : : gfp ) .
This test revealed that the overexpression of FliC observed on Western blot analysis was due to a dramatic increase in the percentage of the bacterial population transcribing fliC in ΔydiV cultures ( Fig. 2 A and B ) .
In contrast to WT , ΔydiV cultures were unimodally fliC - ON ; the average percentage of fliC - ON was 61.24 % for WT and 91.44 % for ΔydiV ( P = 7.8 × 10 − 10 ) .
Deletion of ydiV removed the persistently fliC - OFF subpopulation .
To test whether complementation could reconstitute fliC bistability in the ΔydiV mutant , ydiV was cloned downstream of an arabinose - inducible promoter .
Low concentrations of inducer restored a fliC - OFF population to the ΔydiV PfliC : : gfp strain ; at the highest concentration of inducer , fliC transcription was reduced below the level of detection in most cells ( Fig. 2C ) .
We conclude that YdiV represses fliC expression , and that a YdiVdirected process occurring in a subpopulation of cells produces bistability of fliC transcription .
Products of the class I operon flhDC activate transcription of class II operons ( Fig. 3A ) .
The class II gene fliA encodes σ 28 , which activates transcription of fliC and other class III genes .
PflhDC : : gfp , a transcriptional reporter construct in which GFP expression is driven from the class I promoter , was used to investigate whether YdiV controls flagellar gene expression from the top of the regulatory cascade ( Fig. 3A ) .
The mean fluorescent intensities ( MFIs ) of WT and ΔydiV populations harboring this reporter were averaged over 10 trials per strain .
These average MFIs did not differ significantly between the strains ( Fig. 3B ) , indicating that YdiV does not regulate flhDC transcription .
A flhD - lacZ translational reporter fusion revealed that the flhDC mRNA is translated equally by the WT and ΔydiV strains ( Fig. 3C ) .
The FlhD 4 C 2 complex is posttranslationally regulated by proteolytic degradation .
To examine whether YdiV regulates this process , a 3 × FLAG epitope tag fused to the C terminus of FlhC was used to compare the amount of a master flagellar regulatory protein in the ΔydiV and WT backgrounds ( Fig. 3D ) .
Western blot analysis revealed that ΔydiV cultures contained similar amounts of FlhC : : 3 × FLAG as WT cultures ( Fig. 3D ) , demonstrating that YdiV does not reduce fliC expression by degrading FlhD 4 C 2 .
Wada et al. ( 16 ) showed that YdiV can bind to FlhD and prevent FlhD 4 C 2 from binding the fliA promoter , thereby inhibiting fliA transcription .
Thus , we hypothesized that YdiV might initiate phenotypic heterogeneity in flagellar gene expression by directly repressing fliA ; this heterogeneity could then be transmitted down through the flagellar gene cascade to fliC .
To test this hypothesis , we used a transcriptional reporter construct in which GFP expression was driven from the fliA promoter ( Fig. 3E ) .
The fliA transcriptional distributions of WT populations were bistable , with distinct peaks of fliA - OFF and fliA - ON cells .
However , in the ΔydiV strain , most cells were transcribing fliA ; the average percentage of fliA - ON was 55.51 % for WT and 87.03 % for ΔydiV ( P = 8.4 × 10 − 17 ) .
Thus , the transcriptional profiles of fliA in WT and ΔydiV closely mirrored those of fliC in the two backgrounds .
We conclude that in WT Salmonella , YdiV prevents activation of fliA transcription in a subpopulation of cells .
Because FliA is required for fliC expression , this repression causes bistability in the transcription of fliC .
YdiV Represses fliC Transcription in Vivo .
Salmonella living within macrophages require ClpXP protease , which degrades FlhD 4 C 2 , to suppress fliC transcription ( 3 , 17 ) .
YdiV also posttranslationally regulates the flagellar master regulatory proteins to repress fliC MICROBIOLOGY Stewart et al. .
Bistability of fliC depends on ydiV .
( A ) Transcriptional fusion of the fliC promoter to gfp reveals distinct populations of fliC - OFF and fliC - ON cells in WT when cultures are interrogated by flow cytometry .
( B ) Incontrast , ΔydiV demonstrates a unimodal distribution of predominantly fliC - ON cells .
In A and B , 10 independent trials ( colored traces ) per strain are shown ; the black trace represents GFP - negative control .
MFIs of the fliC - ON populations are not significantly different between the two strains .
fliC - ON is defined as all cells with fluorescence greater than that of the reporter - minus strain ( average MFI , 1,084.7 for WT and 1,235.3 for ΔydiV : ; P = 0.08 ) .
( C ) WhenexpressionofydiV is driven from the araBAD promoter , increasing concentrations of inducer correspondingly reduce the fliC - ON population ( red trace , 0.0002 % L - arabinose ; blue trace , 0.002 % ; green trace , 0.2 % ) .
All experiments were performed using exponential - phase cultures .
Thus , we hypothesized that YdiV might repress fliC as Salmonella adapts to life within a host cell .
To examine fliC transcription in - vivo , WT and ΔydiV strains harboring the PfliC : : gfp reporter construct were orally inoculated into separate groups of C57BL/6 mice , and the percentage of bacteria transcribing fliC within splenocytes was determined .
Indeed , 10 - fold more ΔydiV bacteria than WT bacteria activated the fliC transcriptional reporter ( mean value , 0.90 % vs. 0.09 % ) , demonstrating that YdiV represses class III flagellar genes in - vivo ( Fig. 4 ) .
Thus , YdiV regulates phenotypic heterogeneity in - vitro and in - vivo and plays a role in the maintenance of the fliC - OFF state during - growth in the spleen .
ΔydiV Elicits an Enhanced Inflammatory Cytokine Response from the Host .
Concentrations of IL - 1β and TNF - α were higher in the sera of ΔydiV - infected mice compared with WT - infected mice , indicating heightened activation of proinflammatory pathways and possibly pyroptotic cell death ( Fig. 5 A -- C ) .
Activation of such mechanisms during colonization of systemic sites could promote bacterial clearance .
If this were true , then we predicted that a ΔydiV ΔfliC mutant would outcompete the ΔydiV parent strain at systemic sites in the host .
YdiV Protects Salmonella from Pyroptosis .
We used a murine competitive infection model to assess the benefit of YdiV - mediated fliC repression within systemic tissues .
Orally introduced Salmonella initially colonize the gastrointestinal tract , then infect the Peyer 's patches ( 5 ) and mesenteric lymph nodes ( MLN ) , and finally travel through the blood and lymph to the spleen , liver , and other systemic sites ( 6 , 7 ) .
When WT Salmonella was coinfected with its ΔfliC derivative , the two strains colonized the Fig. 3 .

ΔydiV Salmonella overexpress fliC in systemic tissues .
C57BL/6 mice were orally infected with 10 6 ΔydiV or WT Salmonella harboring the PfliC : : gfp reporter construct .
Splenocytes were harvested from infected animals , and fliC expression by intracellular bacteria was quantified by flow cytometry as described in Materials and Methods .
( Left ) On average , 10 times more ΔydiV than WT transcribed fliC in the spleen .
( Right ) To facilitate direct comparison of gene expression from ΔydiV and WT bacteria , the two groups of mice were colonized to similar levels ( Materials and Methods ) .
Data from two independent experiments are combined .
Peyer 's patches , MLNs , and spleen of C57BL/6 mice equally well ( Fig .
Next , the ΔydiV strain was competed against its ΔfliC derivative .
Strikingly , on day 1 of the infection ΔydiV was significantly more likely than ΔydiV ΔfliC to be found in the Peyer 's patches ( P = 0.0013 , one - sample t test with hypothetical mean of 0 ) ( Fig. 5D ) .
Despite this considerable advantage , on day 6 , the ΔydiV ΔfliC strain consistently outcompeted the ΔydiV parent strain in the MLN , spleen , and liver ( MLN , P = 0.0002 ; spleen , P = 0.0003 ; liver , P < 0.0001 ; one - sample t tests with hypothetical mean of 0 ) ( Fig. 5D ) .
No difference was observed in the Peyer 's patches ( P = 0.4040 ) , where WT Salmonella normally transcribe flagellin late in infection ( 3 ) .
These data show that YdiV - dependent maintenance of the fliC - OFF state at systemic sites is critical for maximal colonization .
When even a small percentage of Salmonella infecting systemic tissues are in the fliC - ON state ( Fig. 4 ) , a protective host response ensues ( Fig. 5D ) .
The accelerated release of IL - 1β by macrophages infected with ΔydiV compared with WT ( Fig. 1B ) , along with the enhanced serum levels of both IL - 1β and TNF - α in ΔydiV - infected mice ( Fig. 5 A -- C ) , suggest that YdiV - mediated fliC repression at systemic sites protects the pathogen against caspase - 1 -- dependent proinflammatory pathways .
To test this hypothesis , we competed ΔydiV against ΔydiV ΔfliC in caspase - 1 -- deficient mice and measured bacterial colonization on day 6 .
In the MLN , spleen , and liver , the competitive indices ( CIs ) in caspase - 1 deficient mice were significantly different from those observed during infection of WT animals ( P values for comparisons between WT and caspase - 1 -- deficient mice ( Peyer 's patches , P = 0.8245 ; MLN , P < 0.0001 ; spleen , P < 0.0001 ; liver , P = 0.0004 ; two - sample t tests ) ( Fig. 5D ) .
The distributions of CIs were in fact skewed toward an advantage for ΔydiV in the caspase - 1 deficient mice , although this effect was only statistically significant in the spleen ( Peyer 's patches , P = 0.0769 , MLN , P = 0.1612 , spleen : P = 0.0165 , liver : P = 0.2405 , one - sample t tests with hypothetical mean of 0 ) ( Fig. 5D ) .
These data show that YdiV - mediated fliC repression allows Salmonella to circumvent a specific , protective host response .
Discussion YdiV bears no close homology to any currently characterized protein domain .
Its nearest relatives are the EAL domain proteins , many of which are phosphodiesterases that degrade the bacterial second messenger c - di - GMP .
However , YdiV is a very poor match to the EAL domain consensus sequence , and neither degrades nor binds c - di - GMP in - vitro ( 18 ) .
Wada et al. ( 16 ) demonstrated that YdiV binds to FlhD and inhibits the transcription Fig. 5 .
YdiV is required to evade pyroptosis during infection .
( A -- C ) Serum levels of TNFα and IL - 1β were measured as described in Materials and Methods after oral infection with WT or ΔydiV .
Concentrations of TNFα ( A ) and IL - 1β ( B ) were higher in the sera after infection with ΔydiV .
( C ) To facilitate direct comparisons , the mice shown in A and B were colonized to similar levels with either WT or ΔydiV Salmonella ( Materials and Methods ) .
( D ) Mice were orally gavaged with 10 6 cfu of ΔydiV ( strain 2 ) and ΔydiV ΔfliC ( strain 1 ) , for a total of 2 × 10 6 cfu/mouse .
Tissue colonization was measured at the indicated times , and the CIs were calculated as described in Materials and Methods .
ΔydiV outcompetes ΔydiV ΔfliC in colonizing the Peyer 's patches after 1 d of infection ( n = 9 mice ; data combined from two independent experiments ) .
However , on day 6 , ΔydiV ΔfliC outcompetes ΔydiV in the systemic tissues .
This advantage disappears when the same experiment is performed in caspase - 1 KO animals .
of the class II gene fliA .
Intriguingly , Wada et al. observed that YdiV deterministically repressed flagellar genes in response to nutritional cues .
Based on those findings and our present observations , we conclude that YdiV controls both stochastic and deterministic gene expression , tuning flagellar gene transcription in reponse to environmental signals .
The ΔydiV mutant is attenuated compared with WT in oral ( average log 10 CI , − 0.7588 ; P = 0.0258 ) as well as i.p. and i.v. ( 15 ) infections ( Fig .
Intriguingly , the spread in our oral competition data demonstrates variation in the ability of ΔydiV to compete with WT in the deep tissues , which is consistent with the heterogeneity in fliC expression that we observed in ΔydiV populations ex vivo ( Fig. 4 ) and the heterogeneity in the proinflammatory serum cytokine response that we found in mice infected with the ΔydiV mutant ( Fig. 5 A -- C ) .
In fact , deletion of ydiV increased heterogeneity in - vivo , in contrast to our in - vitro results .
The majority of bacteria isolated from both WT - and ΔydiV - infected mice were fliC - OFF ( Fig. 4 ) , most likely due to other regulatory mechanisms that repress fliC in systemic tissues .
Indeed , we have previously shown that the protease ClpX represses fliC expression in macrophages ( 3 ) .
The presence of multiple mechanisms to ensure tight control of fliC reflects the importance of maintaining the fliC - OFF state in specific environments , including systemic tissues ( Fig. 5D ) .
Genetic circuits that produce bistable patterns of gene expression often include positive feedback ( 1 ) , and fliA is subject to two positive feedback loops ( Fig .
The first loop increases fliA transcription by elevating the concentration of FlhD 4 C 2 within the cell ( 19 ) .
In the second loop , FliA ( σ 28 ) directly recruits RNA polymerase to the fliA promoter ( 20 ) .
Because nonlinear gene expression dynamics are essential components of other bistable circuits ( 1 , 21 ) , one or both of these loops might produce an acceleration of fliA transcription that could MICROBIOLOGY Stewart et al. .
108  no. 51  20745 potentially result in bistable expression of class III genes .
In contrast , we discovered that bistability of fliC expression in Salmonella is regulated by YdiV , which controls a mechanism that operates upstream of both positive feedback loops ( Fig .
YdiV controls the proportion of cells in a population transcribing fliA and , consequently , the proportion transcribing fliC .
This is likely accomplished by preventing the flagellar master regulatory complex from activating class II transcription , effectively locking a subpopulation of cells into fliA - OFF mode .
Working with the laboratory Salmonella strain LT2 , Saini et al. ( 22 ) demonstrated that flagellar class III transcription becomes unimodal when σ 28 is unable to activate transcription at the fliA promoter .
Therefore , we propose that ydiV controls bistability of fliA and fliC by ensuring that a subpopulation of cells is unable to activate fliA transcription ( Fig. 3E ) , whereas the σ 28 autoactivation loop likely controls the acceleration of fliA expression once fliA transcription begins ( Fig .
The ΔydiV mutant is hypercytotoxic ( Fig. 1 A and C ) ( 15 ) .
We have demonstrated that this phenotype requires fliC , and that many more cells in ΔydiV populations are transcribing fliC than in WT populations .
An increase in the fliC - ON population could potentially have pleiotropic effects on cytotoxicity in this in - vitro assay ; expression of flagellar genes might increase both access to macrophages and the ability to deliver the toxic protein FliC .
We used cytotoxicity as a screen to identify mutants that we hypothesized would have altered virulence , and thus focused subsequent experiments on the mechanism by which ydiV controls heterogeneity of fliC expression and the role of ydiV in maintaining the anatomical restriction of fliC expression in - vivo .
Previous studies have demonstrated that Salmonella downregulate fliC during - growth in the spleen ( 3 ) , that FliC triggers caspase - 1 -- dependent death of macrophages ( 10 ) , and that caspase - 1 -- deficient mice are more susceptible to Salmonella infection ( 11 , 12 ) .
Miao et al. ( 23 ) recently found that an i.p. - introduced strain of Salmonella , engineered to express fliC within a macrophage , induces pyroptosis of host cells and is outcompeted by isogenic WT bacteria at systemic sites .
Here we show that depletion of YdiV naturally relieves fliC repression in a small percentage of systemic Salmonella , which is sufficient to trigger the caspase - 1 -- dependent protective host response .
This response is highly localized , since coinfecting fliC - OFF bacteria are not cleared to the same extent as the fliC - ON strain .
We can eliminate the possibility that the production of FliC causes a metabolic burden that constrains colonization .
If FliC production posed a disadvantage , we would not expect the fliCexpressing ΔydiV strain to able to colonize caspase - 1 KO mice as as well or better than the ΔfliC ΔydiV strain ( Fig. 5D ) .
Many pathogenic bacteria either repress flagellar genes throughout infection [ e.g. , enteric Yersinia ( 24 ) , Listeria ( 25 ) ] or have completely lost the ability to express flagellar genes [ e.g. , Shigella ( 26 ) , Yersinia pestis ( 24 ) ] , thus avoiding the potent host defense response to flagellin .
In contrast , Salmonella have evolved to regulate flagellar genes in a host compartment - specific manner ( 3 ) .
This allows the pathogen to benefit from flagellar gene expression in favorable host environments .
Flagellin is a proinflammatory molecule , and motile Salmonella grow more quickly than nonmotile strains in the inflamed intestine , because they are able to migrate to the nutrient - rich zone close to the epithelium ( 27 ) .
However , our data demonstrate that tight repression of flagellin is required for Salmonella to thrive in systemic tissues .
YdiV modulates phenotypic heterogeneity in Salmonella populations ; given the costs and rewards involved in flagellar gene expression , this specialization appears to provide a mechanism by which the bacteria maximize fitness in the host .
Thus , a mechanism controlling bistable gene expression significantly impacts the ability of an organism to cause infection .
Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains , Plasmids and Culture Conditions .

The mice received 2 mg/mL of ampicillin in their drinking water during the fast and throughout the course of infection to maintain reporter constructs ( 3 ) .
Because the ability of ΔydiV to compete with WT is variable ( Fig .
S3B ) , we harvested bacteria from mice at approximately the same stage of infection to evaluate gene expression by ΔydiV and WT bacteria that had replicated to similar numbers within the host .
Mice were killed on days 4 and 5 , and bacteria from the spleens were analyzed as described previously ( 3 ) .

Data were analyzed using FCAP Array software ( BD Biosciences ) .
Given the variable ability of ΔydiV to compete with WT , we collected blood from infected mice on days 5 and 6 to evaluate host cytokine production in mice with similar levels of bacterial colonization .
Bone marrow macrophages derived from C57BL/6 mice were isolated and cultured as described previously ( 9 ) .
