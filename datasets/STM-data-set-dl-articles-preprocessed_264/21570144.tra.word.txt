Integrated Stress Responses in Salmonella Shu Shen and Ferric C. Fang Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Microbiology , University of Washington School of Medicine , Seattle , Washington , 98195 - 7242 USA Abstract The foodborne gram - negative pathogen Salmonella must adapt to varied environmental conditions encountered within foods , the host gastrointestinal tract and the phagosomes of host macrophages .
Adaptation is achieved through the coordinate regulation of gene expression in response to environmental signals such as temperature , pH , osmolarity , redox state , antimicrobial peptides , and nutrient deprivation .
This review will examine mechanisms by which the integration of regulatory responses to a broad array of environmental signals can be achieved .
First , in the most straightforward case , tandem promoters allow gene expression to respond to multiple signals .
Second , versatile sensor proteins may respond to more than one environmental signal .
Third , transcriptional silencing and counter - silencing as demonstrated by the H - NS paradigm provides a general mechanism for the convergence of multiple regulatory inputs .
Fourth , signaling cascades allow gene activation by independent sensory elements .
These mechanisms allow Salmonella to utilize common adaptive stress pathways in response to a diverse range of environmental conditions .
Coordinate and Integrated Regulation of Gene Expression Salmonella enterica is a foodborne pathogen that poses a worldwide challenge to food safety .
Despite intensive efforts , large outbreaks and millions of cases of salmonellosis continue to occur each year ( Majowicz et al. , 2010 ) .
Salmonella must withstand a range of environmental conditions as the microbe travels between food sources , animal intestinal tracts and the intracellular environment of host phagocytes .
To respond to these changing environments , Salmonella senses and responds to a variety of signals including temperature , pH , and osmolarity .
Within a host , bacteria may also encounter antimicrobial peptides , nitrosative and oxidative - stress , and nutrient deprivation .
The ability to adapt rapidly to environmental change is essential for Salmonella survival and virulence , and both stress responses and virulence genes are expressed in response to environmental signals .
Environmental signals trigger changes in gene expression via a variety of mechanisms .
Common mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in bacteria include two - component regulatory systems , alternative sigma factors , and transcriptional repressors .
Coordinate regulation allows the simultaneous expression of multiple genes in response to a single Address correspondence to : Prof. Ferric C.

Transcription and gene expression is dependent on RNA polymerase , which in bacteria is composed of five subunits : αI , αII , β , β ' , and ω .
In order to efficiently bind to promoters and initiate transcription , RNA polymerase interacts with a σ factor to form a holoenzyme ( Borukhov and Nudler , 2003 ) .
The σ factor dissociates from RNA polymerase following the initiation of transcription .
In Salmonella , σ D ( σ 70 ) is responsible for the expression of housekeeping genes during normal growth .
Five alternative sigma factors designated σ E ( σ 24 ) , σ F ( σ 28 ) , σ H ( σ 32 ) , σ S ( σ 38 ) , and σ N ( σ 54 ) are activated during stress or changes in growth - conditions ( Gruber and Gross , 2003 ) .
For example , σ S regulates a general stress response by activating up to 500 genes during starvation and in response to a host of other environmental changes ( Hengge , 2009 ) .
Because alternative sigma factors may control the expression of large groups of genes , they provide an effective means for the cell to rapidly effect major changes in gene expression .
Two - component signal transduction systems ( TCS ) , composed of sensors and transcriptional regulators , are used by bacteria to respond to changes in environment ( Beier and Gross , 2006 ) .
The sensor is classically a membrane bound histidine protein kinase that undergoes autophosphorylation when activated by environmental signals ( Stock et al. , 2000 ) .
The phosphoryl groups are then transferred to the response regulator .
Activation of the response regulator typically leads to a conformational change that allows the protein to bind DNA .
TCS sense a variety of environmental signals such as temperature , pH , and osmolarity .
Many TCS play a role in Salmonella virulence , including the PhoP/Q system ( Groisman , 2001 ) .
Classical transcriptional activation involves direct contact between an activator and RNA polymerase , for example , at the carboxy - terminal domain of the α subunit or at region 4 of σ D , in order to recruit the polymerase to a promoter or facilitate open complex formation ( Rhodius and Busby , 1998 ) .
Cross - talk between a sensor - kinase and non - cognate response - regulator appears to be unusual , constrained by multiple insulating mechanisms , most notably at the level of molecular recognition ( Laub and Goulian , 2007 ) .
Another mechanism of transcriptional regulation involves a DNA - binding protein that represses transcription unless an inducer molecule is present ( Lewis et al. , 1996 ) .
Under non - inducing conditions , the repressor remains bound to the promoter region to prevent RNA polymerase from initiating transcription .
Under activating conditions , an inducer causes a conformational change in the repressor so that it no longer binds the promoter region .
In addition to coordinately regulating the expression of multiple genes with individual regulators , Salmonella possesses mechanisms to integrate the control of specific genes or stress pathways to respond to multiple unrelated environmental signals .
Through the integration of stress responses , Salmonella can express universal stress pathways in response to a diverse array of environmental signals , modulate gene responses by placing them under the influence of multiple regulatory pathways , and create regulatory check - points in which multiple conditions must be met in order for gene expression to occur .
This brief review will consider four mechanisms by which such signal integration may be achieved : multiple promoters , sensor versatility , counter - silencing , and signaling cascades ( Fig. 1 ) .
The simplest means of integrating different environmental signals is for gene expression to be regulated from multiple tandem promoters , with each promoter induced by a different environmental signal ( Fig. 1a ) .
One example of tandem promoters can be seen in the transcriptional regulation of the alternative sigma factor σ H , encoded by the rpoH gene , which regulates genes involved in the heat - shock stress response .
The rpoH gene is transcribed from four promoters , three of which are recognized by σ D during normal growth , Int J Food Microbiol .

Another example can be found within Salmonella Pathogenicity Island - 1 ( SPI - 1 ) .
The Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands are AT - rich regions of the genome that encode many of the genes required for Salmonella virulence .
SPI - 1 encodes a type III secretory system that translocates effector proteins into host cells to stimulate cytoskeletal rearrangements , bacterial internalization and inflammatory cell death ( Fink and Cookson , 2007 ; Lostroh and Lee , 2001 ; Patel and Galán , 2005 ) .
The hilE gene , which encodes a negative regulator of SPI - 1 gene expression , possesses three promoters , one of which is controlled by the Mlc repressor ( Lim et al. , 2007 ) , which responds to the availability of glucose , and another that is controlled by the FimZ activator ( Baxter and Jones , 2005 ) , which also regulates Salmonella attachment and adherence under static growth conditions .
A third well - characterized example is the ugd gene , which is required for 4 - aminoarabinose incorporation into lipopolysaccharide .
The ugd gene has two promoters , one of which responds to the PhoP/Q and PmrA/B TCS and a second under control of the Rcs phosphorelay system ( Mouslim and Groisman , 2003 ) , which respond to distinct and independent environmental signals .
Another mechanism by which signal integration can theoretically be achieved involves sensor proteins that are able to sense multiple environmental signals ( Fig. 1b ) .
If a single regulator can be activated by more than one signal , this can provide the basis for a common stress response triggered by diverse stimuli .
A classic example is provided by the SoxRS TCS , conserved between Salmonella and E. coli .
SoxR is both a sensor and a transcription factor that senses and responds to two environmental conditions , oxidative - stress and nitrosative - stress .
Both superoxide and nitric oxide ( NO ) are free - radicals that can cause damage to the cell , and these reactive oxygen and nitrogen species share cellular targets such as iron - sulfur - cluster - containing proteins and DNA .
Superoxide is produced as a byproduct of respiration , whereas nitric - oxide can be generated by metabolism or produced exogenously as a host defense mechanism .
Each SoxR protein contains a single ( 2Fe - 2S ) cluster , which is necessary for sensing superoxide and nitric - oxide .
Superoxide oxidizes the ( 2Fe - 2S ) cluster of SoxR , activating SoxR as a transcription factor ( Gaudu and Weiss , 1996 ) .
SoxR then induces the expression of SoxS , which is responsible for the activation of a diverse set of genes involved in antioxidant defense .
Nitric oxide directly activates SoxR by forming a dinitrosyl - iron - dithiol complex with the ( 2Fe - 2S ) clusters ( Nunoshiba et al. , 1993 ; Ding and Demple , 2000 ) .
However , SoxR is not the primary regulator of the cellular response to NO .
NsrR , an FeS cluster - containing transcriptional repressor , controls the NO stress response .
One of the most conserved genes in the NsrR regulon is hmp , which encodes a flavohemoprotein capable of detoxifying NO under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions ( Bang et al. , 2006 ; Bodenmiller and Spiro , 2006 ; Gardner et al. , 1998 ; Hausladen et al. , 1998 ; Tucker et al. , 2010 ) .
Expression of hmp in the absence of NO can exacerbate oxidative - stress by shuttling electrons to the flavin pool and promoting Fenton chemistry ( Bang et al. , 2006 ) .
Thus , hmp is regulated both by NO and iron availability .
Nitrosylation of NsrR induces the expression of hmp as a protective response , but NsrR represses hmp expression if NO is absent and iron is available ( Bang et al. , 2006 ) .
Responsiveness to both signals allows cells to finely regulate levels of hmp expression , ameliorating nitrosative - stress without aggravating oxidative stress .
The fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator ( FNR ) is a transcription factor that controls the expression of a large number of genes in response to the availability of oxygen .
FNR Int J Food Microbiol .
Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 January 16 .
Shen and Fang Page 4 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript contains a ( 4Fe - 4S ) cluster that is sensitive to the presence of oxygen .
Under anaerobic conditions , FNR functions as a transcriptional activator through the acquisition of a ( 4Fe - 4S ) 2 + cluster ( Popescu et al. , 1998 ) .
Upon exposure to oxygen , FNR is inactivated following the conversion of the ( 4Fe - 4S ) 2 + cluster to a ( 2Fe - 2S ) 2 + cluster , resulting in a decrease in DNA - binding ability ( Khoroshilova et al. , 1997 ) .
As with SoxR , NO can also nitrosylate the iron - sulfur - cluster of FNR to reduce DNA - binding affinity of the protein and mimic the effects of oxygen ( Cruz - Ramos et al. , 2002 ) .
The transcriptional regulator OxyR is a non - metal - containing protein in the LysR family that has been suggested to respond to multiple signals via a redox - sensitive thiol at Cys199 .
Oxidation of Cys199 to sulfenic acid by hydrogen - peroxide promotes a reversible conformational change that allows OxyR to activate transcription of specific genes involved in resistance to oxidative - stress ( Kullik et al. , 1995 ) .
An intramolecular disulfide bond involving Cys199 and Cys208 can stabilize OxyR in an activated form ( Choi et al. , 2001 ; Lee et al. , 2004 ; Zheng et al. , 1998 ) .
An alternative pathway of OxyR activation during nitrosative - stress has been proposed , in which nitrosylation of Cys199 stimulates a similar conformational change ( Hausladen et al. , 1996 ; Kim et al. , 2002 ) .
However , questions regarding the physiological significance of OxyR Cys199 modifications other than oxidation and disulfide bond formation remain ( Helmann , 2002 ; Paget and Buttner , 2003 ) .
An interesting example of a versatile sensor not involving a metal center has been recently proposed .
The Salmonella mgtA gene encodes an ATP - dependent magnesium transporter .
Expression of mgtA is responsive to low magnesium , which is sensed both at the level of the PhoP/Q TCS and a riboswitch contained within the 5 ′ leader of the mgtA mRNA ( Choi et al. , 2009 ; Cromie and Groisman , 2010 ) .
A proline - rich open reading frame also located within the mgtA leader mRNA , designated mgtL , has been shown to confer responsiveness to proline availability and osmolarity ( Park et al. , 2010 ) .
While this observation is intriguing , it has not yet been shown whether mgtA plays an essential role during proline deprivation or hyperosmolar stress .
Although sensor versatility is a theoretically attractive mechanism of signal integration , the small number of examples in fact suggests that true versatility is difficult to achieve .
Even for the known examples , it is controversial whether response to multiple signals represents actual signal integration or merely adventitious triggering of a stress response by promiscuous or incidental sensing .
Xenogeneic Silencing and Counter - Silencing H - NS is a nucleoid - associated protein that globally silences genes acquired via horizontal gene transfer ( Lucchini et al. , 2006 ; Navarre et al. , 2006 ) .
Foreign genes acquired through gene transfer typically have a lower GC content than the resident genome .
In a process designated `` xenogeneic silencing , '' H - NS specifically binds and represses the transcription of AT - rich DNA sequences , thereby limiting the expression of foreign genes and facilitating their later incorporation into regulatory networks ( Navarre et al. , 2007 ) .
Following acquisition , evolutionary modification of H - NS - bound sequences can produce mechanisms of regulated counter - silencing that permit the expression of H - NS - silenced genes under specific conditions .
Several mechanisms of counter - silencing have been described ( Navarre et al. , 2007 ; Stoebel et al. , 2008 ) .
First , antagonists can bind to H - NS , disrupting the H - NS multimeric complexes .
Second , H - NS can be out - competed by DNA - binding proteins with higher binding affinity .
Third , genes may be expressed via alternative sigma factors that have higher affinity to AT - rich DNA .
Finally , geometry of the promoter region may be changed by environmental factors resulting in disruption of H - NS binding .
It is becoming clear that counter - silencing is responsible for a substantial proportion of bacterial gene regulation in response to environmental conditions , particularly with regard to virulence Int J Food Microbiol .

The varied mechanisms by which H - NS - mediated silencing can be countered can facilitate signal integration .
NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Signaling Cascades For example , counter - silencing has been shown to play a role in the regulation of Salmonella biofilms .
Salmonella forms biofilms both within and outside the host in response to a variety of environmental signals such as variations in nutrient availability , temperature , pH , and osmolarity .
Biofilm formation contributes to host colonization and protects cells outside the host from desiccation , disinfectants , and antibiotics ( Steenackers et .
Curli fimbriae promote cell - surface and cell - cell interactions during biofilm formation .
The csgBAC genes can be transcribed by σ 70 in the absence of H - NS , but require the alternative sigma factor σ S to overcome silencing by H - NS under normal conditions ( Olsen et .
Under low nutrient and low - temperature conditions , the regulator protein Crl recruits σ S to the csgBAC promoter , enabling expression of Curli and biofilm formation ( Bougdour et .
The switch between planktonic to multicellular states is regulated by the transcriptional regulator CsgD , whose expression provides another example of signal integration .
Several regulatory proteins , including OmpR , IHF , H - NS , and MlrA , bind directly to a large intergenic region upstream of the csgD promoter to modulate gene expression in response to changing environmental stimuli ( Gerstel and Romling , 2003 ) .
Along with other horizontally acquired sequences , the aforementioned Salmonella pathogenicity islands ( SPIs ) are silenced by H - NS until activated by environmental signals encountered in the intestinal tract or within host cell phagosomes .
Expression of SPI - 1 genes is regulated by multiple transcription factors in addition to HilE , including HilA ( Lostroh and Lee , 2001 ) .
The expression of hilA , also located in SPI - 1 , is controlled by a number of regulatory factors in response to changing environmental conditions .
The hilA gene is silenced by H - NS under low - osmolarity conditions , until H - NS - mediated repression is relieved by HilC and HilD , two other transcription factors encoded within SPI - 1 ( Schechter et al. , 2003 ) .
HilC and HilD respond to different environmental conditions , but either alone is capable of activating hilA expression ( Lucas and Lee , 2001 ) .
Thus , counter - silencing allows SPI - 1 expression to occur under either of two environmental conditions ( Fig. 2 ) .
The SPI - 4 pathogenicity island encodes six genes that , like SPI - 1 genes , are involved in the intestinal phase of Salmonella infection ( Kiss et al. , 2007 ) .
SPI - 4 is co - regulated with SPI - 1 ( Gerlach et al. , 2007 ) ; the expression of SPI - 4 genes requires two SPI - 1-encoded transcription factors , HilA and HilD ( Main - Hester , 2008 ; Main - Hester et al. , 2008 ) .
As with SPI - 1 , SPI - 4 genes are normally repressed by H - NS until de - repressed by HilA under inducing conditions encountered in the intestines .
However , both HilA and HilD are required for SPI - 4 expression .
This can be viewed as a `` checkpoint '' mechanism , since two different environmental conditions must be met for gene expression to take place ( Fig. 2 ) .
Hybrid arrangements in which classical transcriptional activation and counter - silencing are combined also occur ( Fig. 1c ) , as in the co - regulation of SPI - 2 pathogenicity island genes by OmpR and SsrB ( Walthers et al. , 2007 ) , or the co - regulation of the OmpS1 porin by OmpR and Leu regulation of OmpS1 .
( De la Cruz et al. , 2007 ) .
The participation of transcriptional activators as both classical activators and counter - silencers , and the ability to achieve both signal integration and checkpoint regulation , illustrates the versatility of the countersilencing paradigm in achieving diverse regulatory goals .
Signaling cascades , as seen in the Salmonella flagellar regulon , the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 pathogenicity islands and many other examples , involve the sequential activation of multiple genes , which may amplify a response and allow input from multiple signaling pathways and environmental signals ( Fig. 1d ) .

Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2013 January 16 .
Shen and Fang Page 6 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript cascade involves the PhoP/Q and PmrA/B TCS .
PhoP/Q activation can be stimulated by acid pH and antimicrobial peptides or low magnesium concentrations ( Bader et al. , 2005 ; Garcia Vescovi et al. , 1996 ; Prost et al. , 2007 ) , while PmrA/B activation responds both to acid stress and elevated iron ( III ) concentrations ( Perez and Groisman , 2007 ; Wosten et al. , 2000 ) .
PhoP activates the expression of the pmrD gene , encoding a TCS connector protein that binds and stabilizes phosphorylated PmrA ( Kato and Groisman , 2004 ; Kox et al. , 2000 ; Mitrophanov , 2008 ) .
Thus , the PmrA/B regulon is pH - responsive and can further be stimulated by iron in a PhoP/Q - independent manner , or by cationic peptides or low magnesium in a PhoP/Q - dependent manner ( Gunn and Miller , 1996 ; Soncini and Groisman , 1996 ) .
In an analogous fashion , the osmoregulated auxiliary regulatory protein TviA encoded by Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 7 modulates expression of the RcsB regulon in Salmonella Typhi and thereby integrates changes in osmolarity with cell envelope stress in the regulation of Salmonella motility , invasion and capsular synthesis ( Winter et al. , 2009 ) .
Although sigma factors directly control the expression of discrete subsets of genes , the σ S -- dependent general stress response can be triggered by multiple environmental signals and pathways , including those regulated by the alternative sigma factors σ E and σ H .
σ S is required for bacterial survival during stationary - phase and for general stress responses to signals such as changes in osmolarity , temperature and pH ( Hengge - Aronis , 2002 ) .
σ E belongs to the family of of extracytoplasmic function ( ECF ) sigma factors , which play essential roles in membrane and periplasmic homeostasis , and are activated by the presence of unfolded membrane or periplasmic proteins ( Alba and Gross , 2004 ; Erickson and Gross , 1989 ; Rouviere et al. , 1995 ) .
σ E has also been found to have a role in stationary - phase survival and resistance to oxidative - stress ( Testerman et al. , 2002 ) .
In addition , σ S and σ E are both required for virulence in Salmonella ( Fang et al. , 1992 ; Humphreys et al. , 1999 ; Testerman et al. , 2002 ) .
σ H is responsible for regulating genes required for resistance to heat shock , and in addition plays a role in stationary - phase survival ( Jenkins et al. , 1991 ) .
Recent observations have shown that regulatory interactions link σ E , and σ H and σ S in a signaling cascade ( Bang et al. , 2005 ) .
σ E is able to enhance levels of σ S during stationary - phase via increased expression of rpoH and hfq .
Hfq , a σ H - dependent protein , promotes σ S translation by binding the small RNAs DsrA and RprA and stabilizing their interaction with rpoS mRNA to promote translation ( McCullen et al. , 2010 ; Sledjeski et al. , 1996 ; Soper et al. , 2010 ) .
Activation of either σ E or σ H can thereby increase expression of σ S in an Hfqdependent fashion ( Bang et al. , 2005 ) .
Thus , a sigma factor cascade integrates extracytoplasmic ( σ E ) and cytoplasmic ( σ H ) stress responses with the σ S -- dependent general stress response ( Fang , 2005 ) .
In fact , regulation of the σ S general stress response at transcriptional , translational and post - translational levels allows modulation by many environmental conditions including growth - rate , cell density , temperature , osmolarity , pH , and nutrient availability ( Klauck et al. , 2007 ) .
Proteolytic Signaling Cascade The mechanism of σ E activation in response to misfolded outer membrane proteins ( OMPs ) has been well characterized ( Ades , 2008 ; Alba and Gross , 2004 ) .
Under non - stress conditions , σ E is sequestered by the anti - sigma factor RseA at the inner membrane ( Fig. 3 ) .
During heat - stress , RseA is sequentially cleaved by the DegS and RseP proteases .
Initial cleavage of the RseA periplasmic domain by DegS is followed by cleavage of the RseA transmembrane domain by RseP , to release σ E and a residual RseA cytoplasmic domain that is degraded by ClpXP .
The presence of misfolded OMPs leads to DegS activation via interaction with the protease PDZ domain ( Walsh et al. , 2003 ) .
RseP is unable to proteolyze RseA until DegS has first acted upon the periplasmic domain of RseA .

Shen and Fang Page 7 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Conclusions Acknowledgments However , studies in Salmonella have revealed a second pathway of RseA proteolysis and σ E activation .
Although σ E is essential in E. coli , this sigma factor is non - essential in Salmonella .
A null mutation in degS is less attenuating for Salmonella virulence compared to a null mutation in rpoE encoding σ E ( Rowley et al. , 2005 ) .
This is because σ E can be activated during acid stress by a DegS - independent mechanism that does not require the presence of misfolded OMPs ( Müller et al. , 2009 ) .
The acid - pH - triggered DegS - independent activation of σ E is essential for Salmonella survival within the acidified phagosomes of host macrophages ( Müller et al. , 2009 ) .
Acid pH activation of σ E still requires RseA cleavage by the RseP protease , and it has been suggested that acid stress may alleviate inhibition of RseA proteolysis by RseP without requiring initial RseA processing by DegS .
The DegS - RseP proteolytic cascade thus allows the integration of different environmental signals ( misfolded OMPs , acid - pH ) to activate a common stress response controlled by σ E .
The integration of transcriptional responses to different signals allows bacteria to respond to diverse environmental conditions through the expression of common stress responses .
Recent observations are revealing new insights into the mechanisms of signal integration that include tandem promoters , sensor versatility , counter - silencing and signaling cascades .
The versatile pathogen Salmonella enterica utilizes each of these strategies as it adapts to the varied conditions encountered in food vehicles , the host intestine and the intracellular environment .

Transcription of a gene driven by multiple tandem promoters controlled by different two - component regulatory systems .
Two transcripts of different size are shown to emphasize their initiation at different promoters .
Sensing of different environmental signals by a single sensor protein .
Transcriptional silencing by an endogenous nucleoid - associated protein ( small purple squares ) is antagonized by a transcriptional activator ( light purple ) and a second DNAbinding protein ( teal ) in response to different environmental signals .
A transcriptional activator ( light - green ) is maintained in an active state either by its cognate sensor - kinase ( light blue ) or by a protein ( dark green ) under the control of a separate twocomponent regulatory system .

Counter - silencing allows signal integration and checkpoint regulation of Salmonella Pathogenicity Island genes HilA , a transcription factor involved in the regulation of SPI - 1 genes , is silenced by H - NS ( purple squares ) under repressing conditions .
Either HilC or HilD is capable of relieving HNS - mediated repression , allowing hilA to be expressed under either of two environmental conditions .
HilA is also required for the expression of SPI - 4 genes siiABCDE .
However , SPI - 4 genes are activated only when both HilA and HilD are present , ensuring that SPI - 4 genes are expressed only when specific environmental conditions are met .

Activation of σ E by a Proteolytic Cascade Canonical activation of the alternative sigma factor σ E is initiated by the presence of misfolded outer membrane proteins that relieve inhibition of the periplasmic DegS protease ( see text ) .
Site 1 proteolysis of the periplasmic domain of the RseA anti - sigma by DegS allows subsequent intramembrane proteolysis of RseA at site 2 by the RseP protease , resulting in release of σ E and the expression of σ E -- dependent genes .
A second route of activation that also involves RseA proteolysis by RseP is stimulated by acid - pH stress in a DegS - independent manner ( modified from Müller et al , 2009 ) .
