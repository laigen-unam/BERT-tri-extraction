Despite the fact that the LuxS/autoinducer -2 ( AI - 2 ) QS system is necessary for normal expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island - 1 ( SPI - 1 ) , the mechanism remains unknown .
Here , we report that the LsrR protein , a transcriptional regulator known to be involved in LuxS/AI -2 - mediated QS , is also associated with the regulation of SPI - 1-mediated Salmonella virulence .
We determined that LsrR negatively controls SPI - 1 and flagella gene expressions .
As phosphorylated AI - 2 binds to and inactivates LsrR , LsrR remains active and decreases expression of SPI - 1 and flagella genes in the luxS mutant .
The reduced expression of those genes resulted in impaired invasion of Salmonella into epithelial cells .
Expression of SPI - 1 and flagella genes was also reduced by overexpression of the LsrR regulator from a plasmid , but was relieved by exogenous AI - 2 , which binds to and inactivates LsrR .
These results imply that LsrR plays an important role in selecting infectious niche of Salmonella in QS dependent mode .

* E - mail : sangryu@snu.ac.kr Introduction Bacteria control gene expression patterns in response to changes in their population density through a process called quorum - sensing ( QS ) .
In QS , small signaling - molecules called autoinducers are synthesized and released from the bacterial cells , and accumulate in the external environment [ 1 ] .
When cell density reaches a certain level , producing autoinducer concentrations over a minimal threshold , the autoinducers bind to cognate receptors to promote changes in gene expression [ 2 ] .
QS systems regulate a large number of physiological processes in bacteria including biofilm formation , virulence factor production , bioluminescence , sporulation , motility , and antibiotic production [ 3,4,5,6,7 ] .
Several types of QS systems have been described in various species of bacteria .
Many Gram - negative bacteria employ acyl homoserine lactones for intraspecies communication [ 8 ] , whereas Gram - positive autoinducers are typically peptides [ 9 ] .
Another QS pathway , in addition , in which signaling is mediated by the LuxSproduced autoinducer - 2 ( AI - 2 ) , has been found in both Gramnegative and Gram - positive bacteria [ 10 ] .
The LuxS protein is found in over 55 bacterial species [ 11 ] , and catalyzes the conversion of S - ribosylhomocysteine to 4,5 - dihydroxy - 2,3 - pentanedione ( DPD ) , which spontaneously cyclizes to form the signaling molecule AI - 2 [ 10 ] .
The LuxS/AI -2 QS system is present in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) , whose signal - molecule has been identified as ( 2R ,4 S ) -2 - methyl - 2,3,3,4 - tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran [ 12 ] .
In S. Typhimurium , AI - 2 is imported by the Lsr transporter , an adenosine triphosphate - binding - cassette transporter encoded by the lsr operon and comprised of LsrA , LsrB , LsrC , and LsrD .
The internalized AI - 2 is phosphorylated by LsrK and modified further by LsrF and LsrG [ 13 ] .
Phosphorylated AI - 2 ( phospho - AI - 2 ) binds to the repressor protein LsrR , inactivating it and derepressing transcription of the lsr operon ( see Fig.S1 ) [ 13 ] .
S. Typhimurium causes gastroenteritis and diarrhea in humans due to acute intestinal inflammation , and also causes a typhoid - like disease in mice .
During infection of animal hosts , Salmonella invade epithelial cells of the small intestine .
Invasion is mediated by a type three secretion system encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) .
The SPI - 1 type three secretion system forms a needlelike complex through which a number of effector proteins are translocated into host cells and mediate modification of the actin cytoskeleton [ 14 ] .
Expression of SPI - 1 is controlled by various environmental cues including oxygen tension , osmolarity , pH , and nutrients , reflecting the complex conditions in the intestinal lumen [ 15,16,17 ] .
Previously , we reported that LuxS - mediated QS is required for normal expression of a subset of genes within SPI - 1 and contributes to virulence of S. Typhimurium because deletion of PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e37059 Quorum Sensing Controls Invasiveness of Salmonella the luxS gene decreased the transcription of SPI - 1 genes and impaired invasion of Salmonella [ 18 ] .
In contrast , another study recently reported that mutation of the luxS gene has no effects on the expression of SPI - 1 and Salmonella virulence in a mouse infection model [ 19 ] .
LuxS could have different effects on SPI - 1 expression depending on the exact experimental conditions because of its pleiotropic functions [ 20 ] .
Thus , the contradictory results may be resolved by a more complete understanding of LuxS effects on SPI - 1 expression .
We sought to clarify the role of LuxS by finding a factor that links LuxS/AI -2 - mediated QS and SPI - 1 expression .
In the present study , we report that LsrR , a DNA - binding repressor of the lsr operon [ 21 ] , negatively controls expression of SPI - 1 and flagella genes and also regulates the ability of Salmonella to invade host cells .
Results Salmonella LuxS Mutant is Indeed Defective for InvFdependent Expression of SPI - 1 Genes and Attenuated for Virulence in Mice luxS deletion mutants have widely been used to reveal the roles of QS in bacterial physiology .
However , the role of LuxS in Salmonella pathogenesis is controversial .
We reported that a Salmonella strain lacking the luxS gene displays defects in virulence phenotypes associated with SPI - 1 expression [ 18 ] , but these findings were not reproduced by others [ 19 ] .
These contradictory results could be due to the pleiotropic effects of luxS mutation [ 20 ] , or reflect a recently described non - quorum - sensing function of LuxS [ 22 ] .
To clarify the role of LuxS in Salmonella virulence , it is necessary to identify the factor that directly connects LuxSdependent QS to regulation of SPI - 1 virulence genes .
Before searching for such a factor , we confirmed that luxS is required for normal SPI - 1-mediated Salmonella virulence .
We showed that luxS deletion causes reduced expression of the invF gene , which in turn decreases expression of the InvF - regulated SPI - 1 genes sicA , sigD , and sopE [ 18 ] .
By conducting qRT - PCR , we determined that the mRNA levels of the sicA , sopB , and sopE genes decrease in both the DinvF strain and the DluxS DinvF double mutant strain ( Fig. 1A ) .
Expression of invF from a plasmid restored transcription of sicA , sopB and sopE to wild - type levels in the DluxS DinvF and the DluxS strains as well as the invF deletion strain ( Fig. 1A ) .
In contrast , the luxS expression from a plasmid failed to do so in both the DluxS DinvF and the DinvF strains ( Fig. 1A and data not shown ) .
These data indicate that the reduced transcription levels of a subset of SPI - 1 genes in the luxS deletion mutant were due to a decrease in InvF levels .
Our previous finding showed that the luxS mutant is attenuated for virulence in mice was based on bacterial numbers in liver and spleen [ 18 ] , whereas Perrett et al. [ 19 ] reported that the luxS mutant did not display any significant differences in virulence compared to wild - type was based on number of live mice at day 12 post infection [ 19 ] .
We decided to re - evaluate the virulence of the luxS mutant strain with a detailed monitoring ( i.e. monitoring for every 12 or 24 h ) of the survival of mice infected with Salmonella .
Our data also show that all mice infected with either the wild - type or the luxS mutant strain died by 12 days after oral or intraperitoneal challenge ( Fig. 1B and C ) , but the survival of mice infected with the luxS mutant was significantly delayed compared to those infected with wild - type Salmonella ( Fig. 1B and C , p ,0.0001 ) .
Taken together , these data emphasize that LuxS is necessary for normal expression of SPI - 1 by controlling InvF and also for normal virulence of Salmonella .
LsrR Negatively Controls Expression of SPI - 1 Genes in the Absence of LuxS Because LuxS is not a DNA - binding protein , we hypothesize that there must be a transcription factor that links QS and SPI - 1 regulation as described in other bacteria that regulate gene expression in response to QS [ 11 ] .
In this sense , we focused on the LsrR protein , the repressor of the lsr operon , because it is the only known regulator controlled by Salmonella QS [ 1 ] .
Phospho - AI - 2 binds to LsrR inactivating its ability to act as a repressor and thereby inducing expression of the lsr operon [ 13 ] .
Because the luxS deletion mutant can not produce AI - 2 , LsrR is constitutively active .
If LsrR negatively regulates the expression of SPI - 1 genes , then deletion of the luxS gene would be expected to decrease expression of SPI - 1 genes as we reported previously [ 18 ] .
To test the hypothesis that LsrR lowers expression of SPI - 1 genes , we constructed DlsrR and DlsrR DluxS strains carrying a chromosomal invF - lacZ fusion .
b - galactosidase assay determined that deletion of lsrR had no effect on transcription of the invF - lacZ fusion ( Fig. 2A ) .
However , the absence of LsrR compensated for the transcriptional defect in invF - lacZ expression in the luxS deletion mutant ( Fig. 2A ) .
The regulatory effects of LsrR in the absence of luxS gene were analyzed in cultures with ( Fig. 2A ) or without shaking ( data not shown ) .
This result was confirmed to be due to the absence of LsrR function because expression of LsrR from a heterologous promoter reduced invF transcription in the DluxS DlsrR double mutant strain ( Fig .
These results suggest that in the absence of LuxS - catalyzed AI - 2 production , LsrR represses InvF expression , which in turn reduces transcription levels of the InvF - regulated genes within SPI - 1 .
The internalization of Salmonella into epithelial tissues of animal hosts is mediated by a number of gene products expressed from the SPI - 1 locus [ 14 ] , suggesting a role for LsrR in regulating internalization .
We next examined whether LsrR regulates the invasiveness of Salmonella .
Deletion of luxS impaired the ability of Salmonella to invade HEp - 2 epithelial cells ( Fig. 2B ) , as we reported previously [ 18 ] .
If both lsrR and luxS are deleted , however , invasion of HEp - 2 cells is comparable to that of the parental lsrR + luxS + strain ( Fig. 2B ) .
These results are in good agreement with the finding that lsrR deletion restored expression levels of InvF in the luxS deletion strain ( Fig. 2A ) .
Taken together , our results suggest that , when activated by the absence of AI - 2 , the LsrR protein represses SPI - 1 expression , which impairs Salmonella 's invasiveness .
Overexpression of the LsrR Protein Lowers Expression of SPI - 1 Genes The down - regulation of invF expression by LsrR was only observed in the absence of LuxS ( Fig. 2 ) .
This may be because the levels of active LsrR protein ( i.e. , LsrR not associated with AI - 2 ) were elevated in the absence of LuxS .
In contrast , LsrR could be present in a phospho - AI - 2-bound inactive form in a luxS + strain , which could explain why deletion of lsrR gene alone did not alter invF expression ( Fig. 2A ) .
If this were the case , overexpression of the LsrR protein could increase levels of active LsrR protein to a level sufficient to suppress expression of SPI - 1 genes even in a strain carrying the luxS gene .
To test this idea , we constructed a strain carrying a chromosomal invF - lacZ fusion and harboring the plasmid pJH1 in which expression of LsrR is under control of the lac promoter .
b - galactosidase assays show that IPTG induction of LsrR protein lowers the transcription levels of invF by about 4 - fold ( Fig. 3A ) .
qRT - PCR analysis confirms that overexpression of LsrR decreases transcription of several SPI - 1 genes : the transcript levels of the invF , sicA , sopB , and sopE genes were reduced by approximately PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 2 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e37059 Quorum Sensing Controls Invasiveness of Salmonella Figure 1 .
The luxS gene is necessary for normal expression of SPI - 1 and virulence .
( A ) Transcriptional levels of the SPI - 1 genes sicA , sopB , and sopE were determined by qRT - PCR .
Overnight cultures of wild - type ( WT ) and mutant strains were diluted in fresh LB and mRNA samples were prepared from stationary - phase of static cultures .
Values are means and standard deviations of three independent experiments .
( B and C ) Six - weekold BALB/c mice ( n = 10 ) were infected orally with 10 7 CFU ( B ) or intraperitoneally ( I.P. ) with 10 3 CFU ( C ) Salmonella strains .
Mice surviving after infection were monitored daily for two weeks .
g001 3 - to 4 - fold when the wild - type strain harboring pJH1 was grown with IPTG ( Fig. 3B ) .
Next , we used Western blot analysis to investigate whether levels of a SPI - 1 protein were affected by LsrR overexpression .
Western blot analysis determined that overexpression of LsrR in the wild - type strain dramatically reduced levels of the SopB protein ( Fig. 3C ) .
Although the mRNA fold changes and protein levels were different in the LsrR - overexpression and wildtype strains , the negative regulatory effects of LsrR were consistent .
The data presented here demonstrate that the LsrR regulator negatively controls expression of SPI - 1 genes .
Overexpression of LsrR Inhibits Invasion into Epithelial Cells We next investigated whether the reduced expression of SPI - 1 genes resulting from LsrR overexpression affects the ability of Salmonella to invade mammalian cells .

LsrR negatively controls the expression of SPI - 1 genes .
( A ) Wild - type ( WT ) Salmonella carrying a chromosomal invF - lacZ fusion and either the control plasmid , pUHE21 - 2lacI q or the lasR + plasmid pJH1 were grown in LB with shaking for 4 h. Production of LsrR was induced by the addition of 100 mM IPTG .
( B ) WT Salmonella carrying pJH1 were grown LB or LB supplemented with 100 mM IPTG , with shaking for 4 h .
The mRNA levels of SPI - 1 genes were determined by qRT - PCR .
Shown in ( A ) and ( B ) are the mean values and standard deviation of three independent experiments .
( C ) Western blot analysis was conducted on cell extracts prepared from the strain harboring either pUHE21 - 2lacI q or pJH1 grown in LB with 100 mM IPTG , with shaking for 4 h .
These strains express the SopB protein tagged with a HA - epitope from the normal chromosomal location .
g003 were incubated with the wild - type strain carrying pJH1 that had been grown with IPTG to induce LsrR expression , invasion was greatly impaired ( i.e. , 17 % invasion compared to that of the wildtype strain ; Fig. 4 ) .
Expression of SPI - 1 and motility are both required for Salmonella cells to gain entry into epithelial cells [ 14,23 ] , but the requirement for motility can be overcome through the use of mild centrifugation [ 23 ] .
To examine whether the defective invasion phenotype of LsrR - overexpressing Salmonella was solely due to the decrease in SPI - 1 expression , or whether motility might also be affected , a mild centrifugation was applied to promote bacterium - host cell contacts during the invasion assay [ 23 ] .
Although invasion was still decreased in the LsrR overexpressing strain when adherence of Salmonella cells to the epithelial cells was promoted using centrifugation ( Fig. 4 ) , invasion was only 62 % that of the wildtype strain ( Fig. 4 ) .
Thus , centrifugation partially restored invasion of HEp - 2 cells by Salmonella overexpressing LsrR .
The LsrR Protein Negatively Regulates Expression of Flagella Genes Because the enhanced contact of bacterium - host cell by centrifugation partially recovered the defective invasiveness of LsrR - overexpressing Salmonella , we reasoned that motility of Salmonella might also be regulated by LsrR or LuxS .
We examined the effect of luxS and lsrR deletions on expression of fliC which encodes flagellin , the major component of the flagellum [ 24 ] , by using chromosomal fliC - lacZ fusion strains .
The overexpression of LsrR decreased Salmonella invasion into HEp - 2 epithelial cells , even when the requirement for motility is bypassed through centrifugation .
Monolayers of HEp - 2 epithelial cells were infected with the wild - type ( WT ) Salmonella , WT harboring backbone plasmid , pUHE21 - 2lacI q , and WT harboring pJH1 strains in the presence or absence of 100 mM IPTG .
To exclude the requirement of motility , mild centrifugation was employed ( centri .
The numbers of internalized bacteria were determined as described in Methods .
Values represent the relative amount of internalized bacteria and have been normalized to the level of internalization of WT strain , which was set at 1.00 .

Overnight cultures of the WT strain harboring either pUHE21 - 2lacI q or pJH1 were diluted ( 1:100 ) into fresh LB broth in the presence or absence of 100 mM IPTG and grown for 4 h with ( aerobic ) or without ( anaerobic ) shaking .
Secreted proteins were recovered from cell - free spent culture media by TCA precipitation .
( D ) Electron microscopic observation of flagella using negative stain .
Samples were prepared from WT cells harboring either pUHE21 - 2lacI q or pJH1 grown in LB with 100 mM IPTG .
The scale bar indicates 0.5 mm .
( E ) Phenotypic assay for motility was performed to confirm the down - regulation of flagella genes in LsrR - overexpressing Salmonella cells .
A 1 ml aliquot of washed WT cells harboring either pUHE21 - 2lacI q or pJH1 was stab inoculated into 0.3 % LB agar with or without 100 mM IPTG .
The images were taken following 8 h of growth at 37uC .
g005 determined that fliC expression decreased in the luxS deletion mutant , unaffected by deletion of lsrR , and elevated in the DluxS DlsrR double mutant ( Fig. 5A ) .
These results indicate that LsrR represses transcription of the fliC gene in the absence of LuxS .
We next investigated the effect of LsrR overexpression on flagella gene expression .
b - galactosidase assays revealed that in the fliC - lacZ fusion strain carrying pJH1 , the transcription levels of fliC decreased by approximately 4 - fold upon IPTG addition ( Fig. 5B ) .
Moreover , qRT - PCR determined that the mRNA levels of the flhD and fliA , which encode key regulators of flagella synthesis [ 24 ] , were reduced by approximately 3 - fold when the wild - type strain harboring pJH1 was grown with IPTG ( Fig. 3D ) .
Analysis of secreted proteins showed that LsrR overexpression in wild - type Salmonella greatly reduced levels of the flagella proteins , FliC , FliD , and FlgL ( Fig. 5C ) .
Levels of the SPI - 1 effector proteins SipA , SipC , and SipD , were also lowered upon LsrR overexpression , consistent with the regulatory role of LsrR for SPI - 1 genes ( Fig. 5C ) .
These results indicate that , in addition to regulating the SPI - 1 genes , the LsrR protein also negatively regulates flagella genes .
The LsrR Protein Suppresses Motility of Salmonella Because expression levels of flagella decreased in the LsrRoverexpressing Salmonella strain ( Fig. 5B and C ) , we asked whether the flagella structure is affected by LsrR levels .
Transmission electron microscopy using a negative stain allows visualization of flagella appendages on the surface of the S. Typhimurium cells [ 24 ] .
Using transmission electron microscopy , we were able to observe flagella on the Salmonella cells harboring the vector pUHE21 - 2lacI q ( Fig. 5D ) , but not on cells carrying pJH1 grown in the presence of IPTG to induce LsrR overexpression ( Fig. 5D ) .
We also compared the motility phenotypes of the wild - type Salmonella strains harboring pUHE21 - 2lacI q and pJH1 .
We found that both strains were motile in the absence of IPTG ; however , motility of the strain carrying pJH1 was abolished in the presence of IPTG ( Fig. 5E ) .
These results show that the overexpression of LsrR suppresses Salmonella motility .
LsrR - mediated QS Controls Expression of SPI - 1 and Flagella Genes As LsrR is a repressor of an operon comprising AI - 2 transporter , overexpression of LsrR turns off the QS system of Salmonella and results in impaired invasiveness with reduced expression of SPI - 1 and flagella as described above .
Those effects may be associated with AI - 2 signaling and QS or be an artifact resulting from ectopic expression of LsrR without any relevance to QS .
We reasoned that we could distinguish between these two possibilities by modulating the levels of AI - 2 in the overexpression strain because the phospho - AI - 2 binds to LsrR , inactivating it [ 13 ] .
If LsrR regulates SPI - 1 and flagella genes in response to QS , addition of exogenous AI - 2 should result in derepression of those genes .
This experiment is complicated by the fact that the strain overexpressing LsrR can not import and phosphorylate AI - 2 due to repression of the lsr operon and lsrK [ 25 ] .
To circumvent this problem , the promoters of the lsr operon and the lsrK gene were replaced with the promoter of the chloramphenicol resistance gene ( Pcat ) which is constitutively expressed [ 26 ] , and not repressed by LsrR ( Fig. 6A ) .
To test whether LsrR regulates SP1 - 1 and flagella genes in response to QS , we examined the expression of chromosomal invF - lacZ and fliC - lacZ - fusions in Pcat - lsr strains ( containing PcatlsrA and Pcat - lsrK ) harboring pJH1 that were grown in the PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 5 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e37059 Quorum Sensing Controls Invasiveness of Salmonella Figure 6 .

The promoters of the lsr operon ( lsrA ) and lsrK have been replaced with the constitutively expressed promoter of the chloramphenicol resistant gene ( Pcat ) .
( B and C ) The Pcat - lsr strains harboring pJH1 carrying a chromosomal invF - lacZ ( B ) or fliC - lacZ ( C ) transcriptional - fusion were grown in LB containing 100 mM IPTG to induce LsrR expression , with shaking .
When indicated , the signal - molecule , AI - 2 ( DPD ) , was added at final concentrations of 48 and 144 mM .
( D ) The SDS - PAGE gel pattern of secreted flagella proteins was evaluated in the absence or presence of 100 mM IPTG and/or 144 mM DPD .
The secreted proteins were recovered from cell - free spent culture media by TCA precipitation .
( E ) Western blot analysis was conducted on cell extracts prepared from Pcat - lsr strains harboring pJH1 grown in LB or LB containing 100 mM IPTG and/or 144 mM DPD , with shaking .
These strains express the SopB protein tagged with a HA - epitope ( SopB - HA ) from the normal chromosomal location .

After the gentamicin treatment , the numbers of internalized bacteria were determined by plating the bacteria on LB agar following appropriate dilutions .

g006 presence or absence of IPTG or exogenous AI - 2 .
As expected , overexpression of LsrR reduced expression levels of the invF and fliC genes ( Fig. 6B and C ) .
Exogenous AI - 2 restored expression of both the invF and fliC genes in dose dependent manner ( Fig. 6B and C ) .
In agreement with the transcriptional changes , the decreased production of flagella and the SopB protein observed upon LsrR overexpression was restored upon the addition of AI - 2 ( Fig. 6D and E ) .
In WT with backbone plasmid , however , exogenous AI - 2 with or without IPTG did not affect the expression of both invF and fliC genes ( Fig .
S3A and B ) and the production of SopB protein ( Fig .
PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 6 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e37059 Quorum Sensing Controls Invasiveness of Salmonella We also asked whether addition of AI - 2 to the Pcat - lsr Pcat - lsrK strain could restore the defective invasiveness resulting from LsrR overexpression .
Overexpression of LsrR inhibited invasion of both the wild - type and the Pcat - lsr strains into epithelial cells ( 17 % and 25 % invasion relative to the wild - type strain , respectively ; Fig. 6F ) .
However , addition of exogenous AI - 2 restored the invasion phenotype of the Pcat - lsr strain , but not the wild - type strain ( Fig. 6F ) .
Taken together , these findings suggest that the LsrRmediated QS signaling system modulates expression of SPI - 1 and flagella , and consequently invasion of Salmonella into host cells .
Discussion QS systems have been proposed to play a role in virulence of several pathogens based on studies of luxS mutant phenotypes , including Escherichia coli O157 : H7 [ 27,28 ] , Streptococcus pyogenes [ 4,29 ] , Porphyromonas gingivalis [ 30 ] , Neisseria meningitides [ 31 ] , and Salmonella Typhimurium [ 18 ] .
However , because the luxS gene has also been proposed to have non - QS functions [ 22 ] , it can be difficult to define a role for LuxS - mediated QS in bacterial pathogenesis .
Indeed , although we have reported the role of LuxS/AI -2 QS in regulation of SPI - 1 in S. Typhimurium [ 18 ] , another report indicated that LuxS did not play a role in SPI - 1 regulation [ 19 ] .
In S. Typhimurium , the regulatory network for AI - 2 signaling is comprised of an AI - 2 transporter complex , LsrABCD , the LsrR repressor , and the LsrK signal kinase [ 13 ] .
LsrR regulates AI - 2 uptake by directly binding and repressing the promoter of the lsr operon [ 21 ] .
Because LsrR is the only known transcription factor in QS in Salmonella , we hypothesized that LsrR might connect LuxS/AI -2 - mediated QS to SPI - 1 regulation .
Here , we report that the LsrR protein can negatively regulate expression of SPI - 1 and flagella genes , and impair Salmonella 's invasion into mammalian cells .
Consistent with previous report [ 32 ] , the deletion of lsrR gene in wild - type Salmonella did not alter invF expression .
However , the deletion of lsrR in the luxS mutant strain restored the reduced expression of the invF and fliC genes in the luxS mutant strain to the wild - type levels ( Fig. 2A and Fig. 5A ) .
These results suggest that LsrR is involved in regulation of SPI - 1 and flagella genes , in contrast to a recent proposal that the regulatory function of LsrR is limited to the lsr operon [ 32 ] .
The luxS deletion mutant would produce constitutively active LsrR due to the lack of AI - 2 , which supports the idea that LsrR might link LuxS - mediated QS and SPI - 1 regulation and allows us to reveal additional target of LsrR in Salmonella Typhimurium .
Overexpression of LsrR in wild - type Salmonella reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of SPI - 1 ( Fig. 3 ) and flagella genes ( Fig. 5A , B , and C ) .
These results emphasize that LuxS - mediated QS controls SPI - 1 and flagella expression with AI - 2-regulated LsrR activity playing a pivotal role .
We tested whether LsrR might regulate expression of SPI - 1 and flagella genes by directly binding to their promoters .
However , electrophoretic - mobility - shift assays failed to reveal LsrR protein binding to DNA fragments carrying promoters of SPI - 1 and flagella genes such as invF , sopB , flhDC , and fliC , while LsrR did bind to the promoter DNA of lsr operon ( data not shown ) .
It is possible that additional factor ( s ) may be required for LsrR binding to the target promoter or that LsrR works indirectly .
Although we do not understand the molecular basis of how the LsrR protein negatively controls transcription of SPI - 1 and flagella genes , our findings clearly indicate that LsrR has regulatory targets than the lsr operon in Salmonella , as reported in Escherichia coli [ 25 ] .
Overproduction of LsrR from a plasmid reduced entry into epithelial cells ( Fig. 4 ) , perhaps by generating increased levels of the active form of LsrR ( i.e. , LsrR not associated with phospho - AI - 2 ) .
This result is consistent with our previous report that the luxS mutant was defective for invasion [ 18 ] .
Moreover , decreased expression of flagella genes in bacterial cells possessing active form of LsrR has also been reported in a E. coli luxS mutant [ 7 ] .
It is still possible that the altered expression of SPI - 1 and flagella genes and reduced invasiveness resulting from LsrR overexpression might be artifacts unrelated with QS .
However , that possibility is made less likely by the finding that treatment with exogenous AI - 2 restored the behaviors of the LsrR - overexpressing Salmonella ( Fig. 6 ) .
Overall , the data are consistent with a role for LsrR in regulating SPI - 1 and flagella in response to QS .
The LsrR regulator represses expression of the lsr operon and the lsrK gene [ 25 ] .
Consistent with this , exogenous AI - 2 only counteracted the effects of LsrR overexpression in the engineered Salmonella strain ( Pcat - lsr ) in which the promoters of the lsr operon and lsrK were replaced with the constitutive Pcat promoter .
To further verify whether the regulatory functions LsrR on SPI - 1 and flagella genes are controlled by phospho - AI - 2 , we constructed a Salmonella strain ( Pcat - lsrA ) carrying only Pcat - lsrA and not Pcat - lsrK ( Fig .
We reasoned that the Pcat - lsrA strain could uptake AI - 2 but not phosphorylate it due to LsrR - mediated repression of the lsrK gene which encodes the AI - 2 kinase [ 1,25 ] .
The Pcat - lsrA strain failed to restore expression of the invF and fliC genes upon the addition of AI - 2 ( Fig .
S4B ) , indicating that LsrK is necessary for the LsrR protein to respond to AI - 2 and control expression of SPI - 1 and flagella ( see Fig .
When ingested by a host animal , Salmonella reach the small intestine and penetrate the epithelial cells .
LuxS is a highly conserved protein , and many species of bacteria produce AI - 2 [ 5,11 ] .
Based on our findings , we propose that Salmonella could recognize the site of infection by detecting and internalizing the AI - 2 signaling - molecules produced by microorganisms in the normal gut flora in addition to recognizing well known environmental signals such as high - osmolarity to induce the expression of SPI - 1 [ 33 ] .
Moreover , studies of the known QS signaling mechanisms employing AI - 2 have revealed that most QS bacteria are sensing the extracellular AI - 2 rather than importing it [ 9,11 ] .
Thus , AI - 2 molecules produced by normal flora would accumulate in the intestinal tract .
The ability of Salmonella to consume AI - 2 molecules could be beneficial for their virulence because the consumption of AI - 2 could interfere with communication between other bacterial species and perhaps disrupt the flora in a way that is favorable for Salmonella pathogenicity .
In summary , we have presented evidence that active LsrR can negatively regulate expression of SPI - 1 as well as flagella genes , and in doing so , reduce the ability of Salmonella to invade host cells .
The effects of LsrR overexpression were relieved by exogenous treatment with the QS signal - molecule , AI - 2 .
These findings suggest that S. Typhimurium may require QS for successful invasion when they have reached the proper environment .
QS may also enable Salmonella cells to modulate expression of virulence factors when they reached a sufficient population level in the right niche .

Bacterial Strains , Plasmids and Growth Conditions Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains used in this study are derived from strain SL1344 .
Phage P22 - mediated transductions were performed as described [ 34,35 ] .
All Salmonella strains were grown with ( aerobically ) or without shaking ( anaerobically ) at 37uC in Luria - Bertani broth ( LB ) .
For shaking cultures , 1.5 ml of media for glass tubes or 50 ml of media for flasks were used .
For static cultures , 50 ml of media in sealed tubes were used .
Antibiotics were used in the following concentrations ; ampicillin 50 mg/ml , chloramphenicol 25 mg / ml , kanamycin 50 mg/ml .
Construction of Strains The method of Datsenko and Wanner [ 36 ] was used for chromosomal gene deletion , chromosomal lacZ fusion , and epitope tagging .
For construction of a Salmonella strain carrying a chromosomal fliC - lacZ fusion , the Kan R cassette from plasmid pKD13 was amplified using primers fliC - lacZ - F and FliC - lacZ - R ( see Table 2 for primer sequences ) and the resulting polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) products were introduced into the SL1344 strain containing the plasmid pKD46 , followed by selection for fliC : : Kan transformants .
The Kan R cassette was removed using plasmid pCP20 [ 36 ] leaving an FRT site for introduction of lacZY using pCE70 [ 37 ] .
Other chromosomal lacZ - fusions were constructed following these procedures , and deletion mutants or epitope tagging mutants were constructed similarly including removal of the Kan R cassette .
Construction of Plasmids An invF + plasmid for complementation was constructed as follows .
The invF gene from SL1344 was amplified by PCR using primers invF - F2 and invF - R2 , and the resulting product was cloned between HindIII and SphI sites of vector pACYC184 [ 38 ] to generate plasmid pJJ13 .
To construct the lsrR + plasmid pJH1 the lsrR gene from SL1344 was amplified by PCR using primers lsrR - pF1 and lsrR - pR1 , and the resulting product was cloned between EcoRI and BanHI sites of vector pUHE21 - 2lacI q [ 39 ] .

After DNase treatment of the RNA solution , cDNA was synthesized using Omnitranscript Reverse Transcription reagents ( Qiagen ) and random hexamers .
Quantification of cDNA was carried out using 26iQ SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) , and real - time amplification of PCR products was performed using the iCycler iQ real - time detection system ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) .
The relative amount of cDNA was calculated using a standard curve obtained from PCR using serially diluted genomic DNA as templates .
The mRNA expression level of the target gene was normalized to the 16S rRNA expression level .
Finally the values were normalized by Table 1 .

Secreted Protein Analysis by Sodium Dodecyl Sulfatepolyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) The proteins secreted into media were analyzed by SDS - PAGE .
Bacterial overnight cultures were diluted ( 1:100 ) in fresh LB and incubated aerobically or anaerobically .
Cell - free spent media was obtained by centrifuging bacterial cultures ( 13,200 6 PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 8 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e37059 Quorum Sensing Controls Invasiveness of Salmonella Table 2 .

Cell - free spent media were mixed with prechilled trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) to final concentration of 10 % , chilled on ice for 2 h , and then centrifuged at 15,000 6 g for 15 min .
The pellets were washed with acetone twice to remove all the TCA from the precipitates .
After air drying , the pellets were dissolved in SDS sample buffer [ 41 ] , and SDS - PAGE was performed using a 15 % acrylamide gels from a mini - gel kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Inc ) .
Proteins were visualized by staining with colloidal blue .
Transmission Electron Microscopic Analysis Bacterial cells grown in LB for 16 h at 37uC without shaking were deposited on carbon - film grids , partially dried , and stained with 2.0 % uranyl acetate .
The negatively stained samples were observed using a 2000EX transmission electron microscope ( JEOL , Ltd ) at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV .
Motility Assay Bacterial motility was measured as described previously [ 42 ] .
Briefly , 0.3 % LB agar plates were stab inoculated with 1 ml ofa washed overnight culture .
The plates were incubated upright at 37uC , and the diameter of bacterial growth was measured every PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 9 May 2012  Volume 7  Issue 5  e37059 Quorum Sensing Controls Invasiveness of Salmonella hour .
Where indicated , isopropyl - b-D - thiogalactoside ( IPTG ) was added to the LB agar at 100 mM .
Western Blot Analysis Salmonella strains expressing a HA epitope tagged version of SopB ( SopB - HA ) from the chromosome were grown in LB broth at 37uC .
Bacteria were collected by centrifugation , and cell lysates were prepared using B - PER solution ( Pierce ) .
Cell lysates were resolved in 12 % SDS - PAGE and the SopB protein was detected using anti - HA antibody ( Sigma ) .
Western blot was developed using anti - mouse immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase - linked antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system ( Amersham Biosciences ) .
Invasion Assay HEp - 2 cells ( ATCC , CCL - 23 ) were grown in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ; Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , penicillin ( 50 U/ml ) , and streptomycin ( 50 U/ml ) .
Confluent monolayers for infection with bacteria were prepared in 24 - well tissue culture plates .
Each well was seeded with 2610 5 cells suspended in DMEM - 10 % FBS without antibiotics and incubated for 1 h at 37uC under 5 % CO 2 .
The wells were washed three times with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) before bacterial cells were added .
Bacterial cells were washed with PBS , suspended in pre - warmed DMEM medium , and then added onto the monolayer at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 .
After 1 h of incubation , the wells were washed three times with pre - warmed PBS to remove extracellular bacteria and then incubated for 1 h with pre - warmed medium supplemented with 100 mg/ml of gentamicin ( Gm ) to kill extracellular bacteria .
The wells were then washed three times with PBS to remove the Gm .
The HEp - 2 cells were lysed in 1 % Triton X - 100 for 30 min , and then diluted with PBS .
Dilutions of the lysed cell suspension were plated on LB agar medium to enumerate colony forming units ( CFUs ) .
As necessary , the 24 - well tissue culture plates were subjected to low - speed centrifugation ( 10 min at 500 6 g ) [ 14 ] .
This mild centrifugation promotes bacterium - epithelial cell contact , which bypasses the requirement for bacterial motility in Salmonella invasion .
CFU values for mutant strains were divided by the mean CFU value for wild - type Salmonella .
Animal Experiments The experiment was conducted as described previously [ 43,44 ] .
Six - week - old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources at Seoul National University .
The mice were kept under pathogen - free conditions in filter - topped cages in Individually Ventilated Cage Racks ( MSRS - M70S ; Orient Bio Inc. ) containing sterile bedding , and were fed sterile food and water ad libitum .
All mice were acclimatized for at least 1 week prior to experimentation .
Cohorts of ten mice were infected by oral gavage or intraperitoneally with about 10 7 CFU or 10 3 CFU of Salmonella cells in 100 mL of PBS , respectively .
Water and food were withdrawn 4 h before infection , and re - supplied 2 h postinfection .
Mouse mortality was recorded daily .

Supporting Information Figure S1 Schematic diagram of LsrR - mediated QS regulatory circuit in Salmonella typhimurium .
AI - 2 is synthesized by LuxS and accumulates extracellularly .
Lsr transporter , encoded by lsr operon , internalizes the AI - 2 into the cytoplasm , where it is phosphorylated to produce phospho - AI - 2 by LsrK .
LsrR represses the expression of lsr operon in the absence of phospho - AI - 2 , while it is de - repressed in the presence of phospho - AI - 2 molecules that bind and inactivate LsrR [ 13 ] .
In this study , we demonstrated that LsrR negatively controls the expression of SPI - 1 and flagella genes and this regulation was abolished by phospho - AI - 2 .

Wild - type ( WT ) and other mutant strains carrying invF - lacZ fusion on chromosome were diluted in LB medium and grown with shaking , and b - galactosidase activity ( Miller units ) was determined at 4 h .
If necessary , lsrR expression was modulated by adding IPTG as the indicated concentrations .
Values shown are the means and standard deviation of three independent experiments .
