176 , No. 1 Cloning and Nucleotide Sequence of the Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein - Regulated Salmonella typhimurium pepE Gene and Crystallization of Its Product , an ax - Aspartyl Dipeptidase CHRISTOPHER A. CONLIN , I KJELL HAKENSSON ,2 ANDERS LILJAS ,2 AND CHARLES G. MILLERl * Department of Microbiology , University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , Urbana , Illinois 61801 , ' and Molecular Biophysics , Chemical Center , University of Lund , S - 221 00 Lund , Sweden2 The Salmonella typhimurium pepE gene , encoding an N - terminal - Asp - specific dipeptidase , has been cloned on pBR328 by complementation of the Asp - Pro growth defect conferred by a pepE mutation .
Strains carrying the complementing plasmids greatly overproduce peptidase E .
The enzyme has been purified from an extract of such a strain , its N - terminal amino - acid sequence has been determined , and crystals suitable for X - ray diffraction have been grown .
A new assay using L - aspartic acid p - nitroanilide as a substrate has been used to determine the pH optimum ( -7.5 ) and to test the elfect of potential inhibitors .
Insertions of transposon y8 ( TnlOOO ) into one of the plasmids have been used to localize the gene and as sites for priming sequencing reactions .
The nucleotide sequence of a 1,088 - bp region of one of these plasmids has been determined .
This sequence contains an open reading frame that predicts a 24.8 - kDa protein with an N - terminal sequence that agrees with that determined for peptidase E .
The predicted peptidase E amino - acid sequence is not similar to that of any other known protein .
The nucleotide sequence of the region upstream from pepE contains a promoter with a cyclic AMP receptor protein ( CRP ) site , and the effects of growth medium and of a crp mutation on expression of a pepE - lacZ fusion indicate that pepE is a member of the CRP regulon .
The unique specificity of peptidase E and its lack of sequence similarity to any other peptidase suggest that this enzyme may be the prototype of a new class of peptidases .
Its regulation by CRP and its specificity suggest that the enzyme may play a role in allowing the cell to use peptide aspartate to spare carbon otherwise required for the synthesis of the aspartate family of amino - acids .
Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli contain more than 10 enzymes capable of hydrolyzing small peptides .
Several of these enzymes have been shown to function not only in the catabolism of peptides but also in the breakdown of intracellular proteins ( 30 , 31 ) .
While some of these enzymes are able to hydrolyze peptide bonds between many different amino acids , several others are highly specific , acting only on bonds involving one or a few amino - acids .
Peptidases P and Q , for example , cleave only X - Pro bonds ( 18 ) , and peptidase M ( or methionine aminopeptidase ) specifically removes N - terminal Met but only when the second amino - acid in the chain is small ( 21 ) .
Peptidase E ( ox - aspartyl dipeptidase ) , another highly specific peptidase , acts only on dipeptides containing N - terminal Asp residues ( 3 ) .
This activity has been partially purified from S. typhimurium and shown to be an EDTA - insensitive enzyme with no activity toward peptides with Glu , Gln , or Asn at their N termini .
Mutants lacking peptidase E have been isolated , and their mutations have been mapped ( 3 ) .
Although the loss of peptidase E by mutation conferred no detectable phenotype on a wild - type strain , introduction of a pepE mutation into a multiply peptidase - deficient ( pepN pepA pepB pepD pepP pepQ ) strain led to loss of the ability to use Asp - Pro as a source of proline to supplement an auxotrophic requirement .
Other N - terminal Asp dipeptides were still utilized by such a strain because two additional Asp - X-specific peptidases remain in * University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , 131 Burrill Hall , 407 S. Goodwin , Urbana IL 61801 .
The physiological functions of these enzymes are not known .
Because the specificity of peptidase E differs from that of any other peptidase , it seemed likely that it might have interesting structural features .
To begin the structural characterization of this enzyme , we have cloned its gene and determined its nucleotide sequence .
The enzyme has been purified from an extract of a strain carrying the cloned gene , and crystals suitable for X - ray diffraction studies have been grown .

Primers for sequencing from the y8 ( TnlOOO ) insertions were those described by Liu et al. ( 15 ) .
Both strands were completely sequenced .
Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Bethesda Research Laboratories ( Life Technologies Inc. ) .
Other manipulations were performed by standard techniques ( 23 ) .
Isolation of complementing plasmids and insertion derivatives .
A library containing Sau3A fragments of chromosomal DNA from TN1246 ( 3 ) inserted into the BamHI site of pBR328 was transformed into strain TN1547 ( pepEl [ 3 ] ) with selection for resistance to chloramphenicol and utilization of Asp - Pro as a source of proline to satisfy the auxotrophic requirement conferred by the supQ302 mutation .
Positive clones were purified and retested for peptide use .
Previously described methods were used to isolate insertions of MudJ ( 13 ) and - yb ( 12 ) into these plasmids .
Insertions which inactivated pepE were identified by loss of the ability to use Asp - Pro as a proline source or by decreased ability to hydrolyze Asp - Leu ( 3 ) .
The detection of peptidase activity in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels has been described previously ( 20 ) .
Sequence analysis was carried out by using the programs in the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group package ( 9 ) or the Pustell/IBI programs .
GenBank searches of the nonredundant NCBI data base used the BLAST program ( 1 ) .
Purification of Peptidase E. Strain TN2401 was cultured in 50 liters of medium containing the following ( in grams per liter ) : tryptone , 30.0 , yeast extract , 10.0 ; NH4Cl , 2.5 ; Na2HPO4 - 2H20 , 7.5 ; KH2PO4 , 3.0 ; Na2SO4 .

The pH was maintained at 7.0 by using a pHstat and 5 M NaOH .
Fermentation was started with a 3 % inoculum from a well - grown seed culture .
Cells were harvested at an optical density at 620 nm of 13 , filtered , and disintegrated in a French press .
The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation , and approximately half of this material was used in the subsequent purification scheme .
The crude extract was first subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation , and the 30 to 50 % fraction was collected , dialyzed , and purified batchwise on DEAE - Sephadex by elution with NaCl in concentrations increasing in steps of 0.1 M. Activity was found at between 0.2 and 0.6 M .
The eluate was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation ( 80 % ) , and the suspended precipitate was dialyzed against 25 mM Tris , pH 8.0 .
Further fractionation was achieved on Accell anionexchange medium ( Waters Chromatography Division , Millipore Corp. ) in an HR 16/50 column ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology ) in 50 mM Tris ( pH 8.0 ) with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in 250 ml .
Half of the sample was applied at a time .
The aspartyl dipeptidase - containing fractions were combined and concentrated to 27 ml against a Spectra/Por C 5K ultrafiltration filter ( Spectrum Medical Industries , Inc. ) under nitrogen pressure and subjected to gel filtration on a column ( 5 by 75 cm ) with Sephacryl S - 300 HR ( Pharmacia ) in 40 mM Tris , pH 8.0 .
Aliquots of the gel - filtered material were loaded on a Mono Q column ( Pharmacia ) in 50 mM Tris ( pH 8.0 ) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.12 M NaCl in 90 ml .
The anion - exchange chromatography on Accell and Mono Q was performed with a liquid chromatography controller LCC - 500 and P - 500 pumps ( Pharmacia ) and was initiated with salt - free isocratic elution .
The purification scheme is shown in Table 2 .
Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie dye binding protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard ( 28 ) .
Activity , kinetics , and inhibition .
The activity of ot - aspartyl dipeptidase was measured with L - aspartic acid p - nitroanilide ( Bachem Feinchemikalien AG ) as a substrate at a standard concentration of 0.77 mM ( A313 = 10.0 ) in 50 mM imidazole ( pH 7.2 ) at 25 °C .
Five to 10 microliters of enzyme solution was added to 0.8 ml of substrate solution , and the A405 was recorded ( 22 ) .
The slope of the resulting curve represents the relative rate of hydrolysis under these nonsaturating conditions .
The S405 forp - nitroaniline ( obtained from Janssen ) was determined to be 9.82 x 103 M - 1 cm - 1 ( Cary 219 Varian spectrophotometer ) , and the absorbance of the substrate at this wavelength was neglected .
The substrate solution can be stored for months in the refrigerator without a change in A313 .
More concentrated solutions suffer from crystallization of the dissolved substrate .
The kinetic parameters were determined by means of Eadie - Hofstee plots .
The substrate concentration was determined with 6313 = 13 x 103 M - 1 cm - l , and the protein concentration was determined with an # 280 of 30 x 103 M - 1 cm - 1 , calculated from the amino - acid composition of the sequence .
The glutamyl - and pyroglutamyl - containing peptides were all manufactured by Vega and used to prepare 25 mM buffered stock solutions .
L - Aspartic acid , f - alanine , and 13 - DLaminoisobutyric acid were from either Sigma or Merck .

RESULTS Isolation of plasmids carrying pepE .
The ability of S. typhimurium strains lacking broad - specificity peptidases to utilize Asp - Pro as a proline source requires a functional pepE gene ( 3 ) .
We took advantage of this phenotype to screen a pBR328 ( 27 ) library of S. typhimurium chromosomal DNA fragments for clones that complemented this growth defect .
Two complementing plasmids , pJG29 and pJG30 , were obtained .
Characterization of pJG29 and pJG30 .
To show that the growth phenotype of pepE strains carrying pJG29 and pJG30 was due to production of peptidase E , crude extracts of strains TN2401 and TN2402 were prepared and assayed for peptidase E activity as described previously ( 3 ) .
The ratio of the peptidase E specific activity in extracts of the two plasmid - containing strains to that of the parent strain TN1246 containing only a single chromosomal copy ofpepE was approximately 180 .
To show that this activity resulted from peptidase E , crude extracts were electrophoresed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and stained for Asp - Pro - hydrolyzing activity .
The position of the band of activity was identical to that of the band of activity in an extract of a pepE + strain .
Restriction mapping of pJG29 and pJG30 showed that the two plasmids carried inserts of approximately 9.1 kb ( pJG29 ) and 7.1 kb ( pJG30 ) and that all of the sites in pJG30 were contained in pJG29 ( Fig. 1 ) .
Isolation of insertions in pJG29 .
To localize pepE in the plasmids , insertions of the mini - Mud element MudJ ( Mud11734 [ 4 ] ) into pJG29 were isolated , and a strain carrying a PepE - insertion ( pepE8 : : MudJ ) was saved .

There are no EcoRI , PstI , SmaI , or XbaI sites .
Sites of lyb insertions which eliminate pepE function are indicated by closed circles , and those which do not are indicated by open circles .
The gap in pBK3 indicates the region deleted as a result of MudJ insertion .
The location and direction of transcription of the pepE gene are indicated by the arrow .
176 , 1994 mapping of this plasmid ( pBK3 ) showed that insertion of the MudJ element was accompanied by a deletion of approximately 3 kb ( Fig. 1 ) .
The occasional formation of deletions associated with the insertion of Mu and its derivatives has long been known .
This insertion mutation was transferred to the chromosome , and the resulting strain ( TN2719 ) was used as a recipient in a phage P22 transduction cross with a - TnlO insertion in metAH ( metAH900 : : TnlO ) , a locus known to be cotransducible with pepE ( 3 ) .
The observed linkage of Tetr conferred by TnJO with the Kanr conferred by MudJ ( 1.1 % [ 2 of 174 ] ) falls within the range previously observed for linkage of metAH to pepE , establishing that pJG29 and pJG30 carry the locus to which pepE mutations had been shown to map ( 3 ) .
Transposon - y6 ( 12 ) insertions into pJG29 were isolated , and the resulting plasmids were tested for their ability to complement the Asp - Pro growth defect .
Three insertions led to loss of complementation , and four more did not ( Fig. 1 ) .
The insertions that failed to complement were located near the center of the region deleted inpepE8 : : MudJ , defining more precisely the location of pepE on the plasmids .
A subclone , pCM247 , carrying a 2.6 - kb KpnI - HindIII fragment that includes the region defined by the insertions and the deletion complemented the Asp - Pro utilization of TN1547 , indicating that this fragment carries a functional pepE gene .
Nucleotide sequence of the pepE region .
The nucleotide sequence of a 1,088 - bp region of pJG29 surrounding the noncomplementing yyb insertions was determined ( Fig. 2 ) .
This sequence contained an open reading frame ( Fig. 2 , bp 165 to 851 ) that predicted a 24,768 - Da protein .
Data reported below indicate a molecular mass for purified peptidase E of 27 kDa .
The N - terminal amino - acid sequence of peptidase E purified as described below was determined and agrees completely with that predicted by the open reading frame ( Fig. 2 ) .
To further confirm the open reading frame , the nucleotide sequence of the pepE gene from a strain carrying the pepEl mutation ( 3 ) was partially determined .
This sequence revealed a C - to - T change at position 573 , which predicts a Pro - to - Ser change at position 137 in the open reading frame .
A search of GenBank identified no protein with significant amino - acid similarity to that predicted for peptidase E. Consistent with the fact that peptidase E is a soluble cytoplasmic protein , no signal sequence was present and the hydrophobicity plot revealed nothing of interest .
The presence of only a single cysteine residue demonstrates that the enzyme has no disulfide bridges .
The region 5 ' to the open reading frame contains a potential ribosome binding site , a possible u70 -10 sequence , and a sequence with significant similarity to a cAMP receptor protein ( CRP ) site ( Fig. 2 , bp 67 to 83 ) .
We note that the promoter region contains an inverted repeat located near the proposed -10 sequence .
We note also the presence of an open reading frame 3 ' to pepE reading in the opposite direction .
A BLAST search of GenBank using the amino - acid sequence predicted by this open reading frame revealed nothing .
pepE is regulated by CRP - cAMP .
The presence of a possible CRP site suggests that pepE may be part of the CRP - cAMP regulon .
To test this we cloned a 230 - bp BglII - SalI fragment Strain TABLE 3 .

The pepEl mutation and the predicted amino - acid change which would result are also shown .

( Fig. 3 ) carrying the region containing the putative pepE promoter into the promoter detection vector pRS528 ( 24 ) .
In this construct ( pCM260 ) the E. coli lac operon should be controlled by the pepE promoter .
This plasmid was introduced into isogenic crp + and crp mutant strains , and 3 - galactosidase levels were determined for cells grown on glucose and on succinate ( Table 3 ) .
The results of these experiments indicate that succinate - grown cells contain about threefold - higher , B - galactosidase levels than cells grown in glucose .
Addition of cAMP to glucose - grown cells leads to a nearly fivefold increase in 3 - galactosidase levels .
This increase is dependent on the presence of a functional crp gene .
We conclude that pepE is indeed regulated by CRP - cAMP .

Purification of peptidase E. Peptidase E was purified as described in Table 2 .
Approximately half of the crude extract was used in the scheme in Table 2 .
The partly purified enzyme preparation after the Sephacryl step was stored in the freezer .
Aliquots of approximately 4 % of the amount from this step ( Table 2 ) were then purified on Mono Q when needed .
The pl of the purified enzyme was found to be 4.7 ( by isoelectric focusing ) , and the molecular weight was found to be 27,000 ( by SDS - PAGE ) .
Assay , kinetic parameters , and inhibitors .
Figure 3 shows the profile of activity versus pH for aspartyl dipeptidase , with a maximum activity at between pH 7 and 7.5 .
The choice of 7.2 as the assay pH was made on the basis of these data .
The enzyme is inactive in 0.1 M phosphate at pH 6.5 , but activity increases with pH up to at least 8 ( 30 % active relative to activity in Tris at the same pH ) , probably because of an inhibitory effect of the monovalent phosphate anion .
Two determinations of the kinetic parameters both gave a kcat of 39 s -1 and a Km of 4.3 mM , with an average correlation coefficient of - 0.96 .
Unfortunately , because of the limited solubility of the substrate , all concentrations used were below the Km .
Three 1 - amino - acids were tested as inhibitors for aspartyl dipeptidase ( Table 4 ) .
Modest effects were displayed by 3 - alanine and L - aspartic acid , whereas 1 - DL - aminoisobutyric acid had no effect at all .
In Table 4 , the effects of eight different Glu - containing di - and tripeptides are also listed .
Again , only weak inhibition could be observed .
About 42 % activity remained after 0.75 h of incubation with mercuric - chloride , and 41 % remained after 2.5 h .
The protease classification inhibitors DFP , PMSF , and dipicolinic acid had no effect at all upon the activity of aspartyl dipeptidase .
Aspartyl dipeptidase ( 6 to 12 mg/ml ) can be crystallized at different pH values and temperatures in the presence of CdSO4 with ( NH4 ) 2SO4 or polyethylene - glycol ( PEG ) , but all of our initial experiments produced only thin plates , often growing in clusters .
Generally , the best results were obtained in 50 mM 2 - ( cyxlohexylamino ) ethanesulfonate ( CHES ) -50 mM cacodylate - NaOH ( pH 9.5 ) - l mM CdSO4 - TABLE 4 .

2.5 % PEG 20000 vapor equilibrated against 50 mM CHES ( pH 9.5 ) -0.25 M NaCl , where the tendency of crystal twinning is less pronounced .
The sides of the plates were frequently grown up to 0.3 mm , but the maximum thickness observed was only about 0.025 mm .
These crystals diffracted to 2.6 A ( 1 A = 0.1 nm ) and belong to space group P1 with a = 43.5 A , b = 51.5 A , c = 64.3 A , a = 104.80 , b = 89.60 , and g = 115.2 ° .
Vm was determined to 2.3 A3/Da , assuming two molecules per asymmetric unit ( 17 ) .
An X - ray fluorescence spectrum of a crystal that had been washed with fresh PEG solution was recorded ( data not shown ) and compared with a similar spectrum of carbonic anhydrase , an enzyme known to contain zinc .
Our interpretation of these qualitative spectra is that a - aspartyl dipeptidase does not contain zinc , since the zinc - ion in carbonic anhydrase is easily detected by this technique , whereas the spectrum of a - aspartyl dipeptidase lacks any signal .
A very large crystal was found after 1.5 years of incubation in 12.5 mM Tris - cacodylate ( pH 7.5 ) -2 mM CdSO4 - 0.5 % PEG 20000 ( 7.5 mg of enzyme per ml ) equilibrated against 50 mM Tris - cacodylate ( pH 7.5 ) -60 mM NaCl .

The deduced amino - acid sequence of peptidase E shows that its unique substrate specificity is indeed a reflection of a primary structure unrelated to that of any other peptidase .
A substantial number of peptidase amino - acid sequences have now been determined , and for many of them primary sequence relationships to other enzymes with related functions or specificities have been identified .
It seems a reasonable guess that other enzymes structurally related to peptidase E remain to be discovered .
It will be interesting to learn whether the other two Asp - X-specific peptidases in S. typhimurium are structurally similar to peptidase E. Several other properties of peptidase E differ from those of many other peptidases .
On the basis of its insensitivity to EDTA , we have proposed ( 3 ) that peptidase E , in contrast to most of the other Salmonella peptidases ( 21 ) , is not a metalloenzyme .
This suggestion is strongly supported by the results presented in this paper .
In addition to its insensitivity to EDTA , peptidase E is not inhibited by dipicolinic acid .
The latter was found to be the more efficient of the two chelators in demineralizing carbonic anhydrase ( 14 ) , presumably for steric reasons since it is distinctly smaller than EDTA .
176 , 1994 the X - ray fluorescence spectrum of a peptidase E crystal indicates that the enzyme does not contain zinc or any other metals .
The two active - site serine reagents DFP and PMSF were both unable to inactivate peptidase E .
The specificity of a - aspartyl dipeptidase for a negatively charged residue on the amino - terminal side of the scissile bond is rather unusual among peptide - bond - hydrolyzing enzymes .
We can not exclude the possibility that the peptidase actually has an active - site serine but that the relatively hydrophobic active - site serine reagents are repelled from the active site by the substratebinding residues .
The staphylococcal serine protease , cleaving peptide bonds C terminal to glutamyl and aspartyl residues , is inactivated by DFP ( 10 ) , but the number of investigated proteases with such specificity is quite small .
The active site of peptidase E must accommodate three charged groups close to the scissile bond of its substrates .
Peptidase E thus may not belong to any of the four protease classes , since ( i ) it is only partially inactivated by mercuric chloride , ( ii ) it is not inhibited by metal chelators , ( iii ) it is not inhibited by active - site serine reagents , and ( iv ) neither the amino - acid sequence nor the molecular mass is in agreement with what is found for the acid proteases , which usually contain a Phe - Asp - Thr - Gly - Ser sequence within the 40 N - terminal residues and have a molecular mass of about 35 kDa ( 7 ) .
The pH - activity profile for peptidase E shows a much more alkaline optimum than is observed for the known acid proteases .
Most of these enzymes are active at low pH , although renin has a pH optimum of between 5.5 and 7.5 ( 25 ) .
Partial inhibition by mercuric - chloride suggests that the cysteine residue can be modified but is not essential .
A single cysteine accessible to mercuric ions makes this derivative a possible candidate for isomorphous replacement in order to solve the crystallographic phase problem .
None of the 3 - amino - acids or glutamic - acid peptides we tested were sufficiently strong inhibitors to be used in crystallography or affinity chromatography .
We also note that the binding to subsite 1 ( the subsite on the N - terminal side of the bond to be cleaved ) appears to be restricted to a carboxymethyl group , since ( i ) glutamic - acid peptides are neither hydrolyzed nor bound by the enzyme , ( ii ) P - alanine has the same inhibitory effect as L - aspartate ( which also indicates that the carboxymethyl group and the ax - amino group are the sole contributors to the subsite 1 binding energy ) , and ( iii ) the inhibitory effect of , B - alanine is abolished upon introduction of a methyl group on the p - carbon , as in aminoisobutyric acid .
We therefore expect a good inhibitor of peptidase E to consist of an amino - terminal aspartic acid residue connected to a second amino - acid by something other than a peptide bond , e.g. , a compound in which the amide nitrogen is replaced with a methylene group and/or the carbonyl oxygen is reduced ( 7 ) .
pepE is the first peptidase gene shown to be regulated by CRP - cAMP .
The physiological significance of this finding is not clear .
Although aspartate can not be used as the sole carbon source by S. typhimurium LT2 , several other amino acids ( alanine , cysteine , proline , and serine ) can serve as sole carbon sources ( 11 ) .
Peptidase E is known to hydrolyze N - terminal Asp dipeptides containing Ala , Pro , or Ser , and there is no reason to think that Asp - Cys would not also be a substrate .
It is possible , therefore , that some environment that S. typhimurium encounters contains a sufficient supply of Asp dipeptides which also contain an amino - acid utilizable as a carbon source .
Another possible function for peptidase E involves the carbon sparing that might be achieved by production of aspartate from peptides .
The availability of aspartate spares the cell the necessity of contributing most of the carbon found in aspartate , asparagine , lysine , methionine , threonine , S. TYPHIMURIUM pepE GENE - 171 isoleucine , and diaminopimelate ( 2 ) .
This might be significantly advantageous under conditions of carbon limitation .
Again this presupposes that there are environments in which N - terminal Asp dipeptides are in relatively abundant supply .
We speculate that CRP - cAMP may not be the only regulatory element forpepE .
The finding that the presence in the cell of a plasmid carrying pepE leads to a nearly 200 - fold increase in peptidase E levels ( much larger than expected on the basis of the copy number of pBR328 ) suggests to us that there might be a negative regulator of pepE expression .
The inverted repeat that overlaps the proposed -10 sequence in the promoter is an attractive possibility for a site of action of such an element .
Further work onpepE regulation may provide insight into its physiological function , just as further characterization of its structure should provide an understanding of its unique specificity and , perhaps , reveal some new insights into the mechanisms of enzymatic peptide bond hydrolysis .
