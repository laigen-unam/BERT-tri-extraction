We report that SPI1 and SPI4 gene expression is linked through a transcriptional activator , SprB , encoded within SPI1 and regulated by HilA .
SprB directly activates SPI4 gene expression and weakly represses SPI1 gene expression through HilD .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a common foodborne pathogen that invades intestinal epithelial cells using a type three secretion system ( T3SS ) encoded within Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) ( 8 , 12 , 15 , 22 ) .
The SPI1 master regulator , HilA , activates the expression of the genes encoding the T3SS structural proteins , chaperones , and secreted effectors ( 16 ) .
Three AraC - like transcription factors -- HilC , HilD , and RtsA -- positively regulate HilA expression in response to various intracellular and environmental signals ( 5 , 7 , 17 ) .
In addition to these positive regulators , the genes within SPI1 are negatively regulated by HilE ( 2 ) .
Also encoded within SPI1 is a transcription factor , SprB , from the LuxR/UhaP family of transcription factors .
Eichelberg and coworkers ( 4 ) previously found the gene for SprB to be expressed under conditions similar to those under which other SPI1 genes are expressed .
However , they found that SprB was not involved in regulating the expression of SPI1 genes and speculated that it may instead regulate novel SPI1 T3SS substrates .
In this work , we demonstrate that SprB regulates the expression of the genes within SPI4 .
SPI4 encodes a nonfimbrial adhesin ( 9 ) that is involved in the intestinal phase of infection ( 13 , 14 , 19 ) .
Previously , a number of studies have shown that there is a link between SPI1 and SPI4 gene expression ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 18 ) .
In particular , they demonstrated that SPI4 gene expression is HilA dependent .
However , Main - Hester and coworkers showed that , in the absence of the SPI1 locus , HilA is unable to activate SPI4 gene expression ( 18 ) .
Their results suggest that some other HilAdependent regulator within SPI1 may be involved .
Here , we show that this other regulator is SprB .

control of the P siiA promoter ( 9 ) .
To test whether SprB in fact regulates SPI4 gene expression , we measured P siiA promoter activity using a plasmid - based Venus transcriptional reporter ( 20 ) in the wild type and a sprB mutant .
As shown in Fig. 1A , deleting sprB causes a threefold decrease in P siiA promoter activity as determined by changes in fluorescence .
Moreover , we can complement this mutant by expressing SprB from an anhydrotetracycline ( aTc ) - inducible promoter on a compatible plasmid ( 21 ) .
We next tested how individually expressing the SPI1 regulators -- HilA , HilC , HilD , RtsA , and SprB -- from an aTc - inducible promoter would affect P siiA promoter activity in a SPI1 rtsAB mutant .
Of the five , only SprB was capable of activating the P siiA promoter ( Fig. 1B ) .
We performed similar experiments with Escherichia coli and obtained identical results ( data not shown ) .
To test whether SprB directly binds to the P siiA promoter , we used a coprecipitation assay .
In this experiment , we first expressed 6 His - tagged SprB from the constitutive P LtetO - 1 promoter on a plasmid in a sprB mutant and then passed the cross - linked cell lysate over a Ni 2 column ( see the supplemental material for more details ) .
Upon elution from the column and reverse cross - linking , we found by PCR that SprB directly binds the P siiA promoter region ( Fig. 1C ) .
As a negative control , we also tested whether SprB binds to the P fimA promoter region , a promoter whose activity is unaffected by SprB , and found that it did not .
Collectively , these results demonstrate that SprB binds the P siiA promoter and activates SPI4 gene expression .
HilA transcriptionally regulates SprB expression .
Multiple studies have previously shown that SPI4 gene expression is HilA dependent ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 18 ) .
We therefore hypothesized that HilA regulates SprB expression , as this would explain the decrease in P siiA promoter activity previously observed when HilA is deleted .
It would also explain why other SPI1 regulators -- namely HilC , HilD , and RtsA -- affect SPI4 gene expression , as they in turn regulate HilA expression .
To test this hypothesis , we measured the effect of individually expressing the SPI1 regulators -- HilA , HilC , HilD , RtsA , and SprB -- from an aTc - inducible promoter in a SPI1 rtsAB 2459 2460 NOTE J. BACTERIOL .

mutant on P sprB promoter activity .
Similar to the experiments described above , we used a plasmid - based Venus transcriptional reporter to measure P sprB promoter activity .
Of the five , only HilA was capable of activating the P sprB promoter ( Fig. 2A ) .
Identical results were obtained when we performed similar experiments with E. coli ( data not shown ) .
To test whether this effect is direct , we used a coprecipitation assay with 6 Histagged SprA and found that HilA does indeed bind the P sprB promoter ( Fig. 2B ) .
As respective positive and negative controls , we used the P prgH and P fimA promoter regions .
These results demonstrate that HilA transcriptionally regulates SprB expression .
SprB transcriptionally represses HilD expression .
Last , we tested whether SprB regulates SPI1 gene expression .
Here , we measured the activity of a number of SPI1 - and SPI1 - regulated promoters using plasmid - based Venus transcriptional reporters in the wild type , a sprB mutant , and a sprB mutant constitutively expressing sprB from the P LtetO - 1 promoter on a plasmid .
Our data show that deleting sprB resulted in a mild increase in the activity of all seven promoters tested , except the P fimA promoter used as a control ( Fig. 3A ) .
However , plasmid expression of SprB caused a twofold reduction in promoter activity in a sprB mutant background .
These results suggest that SprB is a weak negative regulator of SPI1 gene expression .
HilA regulates SprB expression .
( A ) HilA can activate the P sprB promoter in the absence of other SPI1 genes ( SPI1 rtsAB ) ; the other SPI1 regulators -- HilC , HilD , and RtsA -- can not .
SprB was also found not to regulate its own expression .

Induction in panel B is used to denote the presence or absence - of - arabinose .
Fluorescence values were normalized with the optical density at 600 nm ( OD600 ; A.U. , arbitrary units ) to account for cell density .
Error bars indicate standard deviations .
( C ) SprB binds to the P hilD promoter region as determined by a coprecipitation assay using 6 His - tagged SprB .
PCR was used to determine whether the P hilD promoter region is in the coprecipitated DNA .
The P fimA promoter region was included as a negative control .
For an expanded description of the experimental procedures , see the supplemental material .
The weak level of repression may explain why Eichelberg and coworkers ( 4 ) previously concluded that SprB does not regulate SPI1 gene expression .
Since SPI1 gene expression is known to be growth dependent , we also checked if expressing SprB from a plasmid in a sprB mutant caused any growth defect .
Our data show that it has no effect ( see Fig .
S1 in the supplemental material ) .
As SprB regulates multiple SPI1 promoters , we hypothesized that it likely represses the transcription of HilC , HilD , or RtsA .
These three regulators are all activators of P hilA promoter activity and each other 's expression as well ( 5 , 7 , 17 ) .
To identify the target for repression , we first expressed SprB from an arabinose - inducible promoter on a plasmid ( 10 ) in hilC sprB , and rtsA sprB null mutants and found that P hilA promoter activity was still repressed by SprB , as determined by using a plasmid - based Venus transcriptional reporter ( Fig. 3B ) .
These results demonstrate that repression is not HilC or RtsA dependent .
Next , we investigated if SprB represses the P hilD promoter by measuring P hilA promoter activity in a strain where the P hilD promoter was replaced with the tetRA element from transposon Tn10 ( 11 ) .
This arrangement decouples hilD expression from its native regulation and causes it to be constitutively expressed from its native chromosomal locus in the presence of tetracycline .
In the P hilD : : tetRA sprB mutant strain , we found that expressing SprB from an arabinose - inducible promoter plasmid ( 10 ) did not affect P hilA promoter activity ( Fig. 3B ) , suggesting that SprB represses HilD expression .
To demonstrate that the SprB - dependent repression of SPI1 gene expression is due to the binding of the SprB protein to the P hilD promoter , we used a coprecipitation assay with 6 His - tagged SprB ( Fig. 3C ) .
These results demonstrate that SprB binds to the P hilD promoter region and likely represses SPI1 gene expression by inhibiting hilD transcription .
Our results demonstrate that SprB functions as a molecular link between SPI1 and SPI4 gene expression .
We propose the following model ( see Fig .
S2 in the supplemental material ) .
Upon induction of the SPI1 gene circuit , HilA activates SprB expression .
SprB plays a dual role in regulating gene expression .
First , it weakly represses SPI1 gene expression by binding to the P hilD promoter and likely inhibiting hilD transcription .
Second , it activates the expression of the SPI4 - encoded adhesin , presumably helping the bacterium to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells during invasion .
This mode of regulation links gene expression in two distinct systems in Salmonella , enabling the coordinate regulation of adherence to and invasion of the intestinal epithelia .
