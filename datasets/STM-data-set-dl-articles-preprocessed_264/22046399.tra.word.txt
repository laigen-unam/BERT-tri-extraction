Using RT - PCR , we have shown previously that fimA transcription is dramatically impaired in both lrp - deletion ( Dlrp ) and constitutive - lrp expression ( lrp C ) mutant strains .
In this work , we used chromosomal P fimA - lacZ - fusions and yeast agglutination assays to confirm and extend our previous results .
Direct binding of Lrp to P fimA was shown by an electrophoretic - mobility - shift assay ( EMSA ) and DNA footprinting assay .
Site - directed mutagenesis revealed that the Lrp - binding motifs in P fimA play a role in both activation and repression of type 1 fimbriae production .
Overproduction of Lrp also abrogates fimZ expression .
EMSA data showed that Lrp and FimZ proteins independently bind to P fimA without competitive exclusion .
In addition , both Lrp and FimZ binding to P fimA caused a hyper retardation ( supershift ) of the DNA - protein complex compared to the shift when each protein was present alone .
Nutrition - dependent cellular Lrp levels closely correlated with the amount of type 1 fimbriae production .
These observations suggest that Lrp plays important roles in type 1 fimbriation by acting as both a positive and negative regulator and its effect depends , at least in part , on the cellular concentration of Lrp in response to the nutritional environment .

* E - mail : rcurtiss@asu.edu Introduction Type 1 fimbriae are mannose - sensitive agglutination factors that mediate bacterial adhesion to a broad range of eukaryotic cells by interactions with mannosylated glycoproteins [ 1 -- 3 ] .
Most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae , includingSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , produce type 1 fimbriae that are believed to contribute to pathogenesis by facilitating the initial interaction with host cells [ 3 -- 5 ] .
The fim gene cluster , responsible for type 1 fimbriae production , is composed of six structural genes , fimAICDHF transcribed as an operon from the fimA promoter , three regulatory genes , fimZ , fimY , andfimW , and an arginine tRNA gene , fimU [ 6 ] .
The structural gene products are the major type 1 fimbrial subunit FimA [ 7,8 ] , fimblin - like protein FimI [ 9 ] , periplasmic chaperone FimC [ 10 ] , outer membrane usher protein FimD [ 6 ] , minor fimbrial subunit FimH ( adhesin ) [ 11 ] , and fimbrial - like protein FimF [ 6,11 ] .
The regulatory fimZ , fimY , and fimW genes are expressed from independent promoters [ 12 -- 14 ] .
The FimZ regulator activates expression of the fimAICDHF operon by binding to the fimA promoter [ 15 ] .
In serovar Typhimurium , FimY and FimW act as a transcriptional coactivator and repressor , respectively , through protein - protein interactions with FimZ [ 12,14 ] .
However , Saini et al. reported that FimY independently activates the fimA promoter , and FimW acts as a negative regulator by repressing FimY transcription [ 16 ] .
The fimU gene product arginine tRNA acts as a posttranscriptional regulator by affecting FimY translation [ 17,18 ] .
Bacteria are efficient at switching between type 1 fimbriate and non - fimbriate status in response to environmental conditions [ 3,19 ] .
The mechanism of phase - variable type 1 fimbriae synthesis has been well characterized in Escherichia coli [ 20 ] .
FimB and FimE recombinases mediate site - specific recombination of the fimA promoter region , resulting in alteration of orientations allowing or blocking transcription [ 20,21 ] .
Nucleoid - binding global regulators that modulate DNA topology , such as Lrp , integration host factor ( IHF ) , and H - NS affect phase variation and synthesis of type 1 fimbriae in E. coli [ 22 -- 27 ] .
In addition , McClain et al. suggested that there is an inversion - independent phase variation mechanism [ 28 ] .
Despite significant homology between the fim structural genes , the mechanism by which type 1 fimbriae synthesis is regulated in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium differs substantially from that in E. coli .
The serovar Typhimurium fimA promoter does not possess a cis - acting regulatory DNA element for reversible inversion - dependent regulation of type 1 fimbriae expression [ 29 ] .
Moreover , homologs of the E. coli FimB and FimE recombinase are not present in serovar Typhimurium [ 30,31 ] .
Conversely , no homologs for serovar Typhimurium FimZ , FimY and FimW regulators have been found within the E. coli fim gene cluster [ 32 ] .
In serovar Typhimurium , Lrp is required for type 1 fimbriae production by activating FimZ synthesis [ 33 ] , whereas in E. coli , Lrp is involved in inversion - dependent phase variation [ 26 ] .
Lrp activates fimZ expression by binding directly to the P fimZ promoter [ 33 ] .
FimZ is an essential positive regulator for type 1 fimbriae PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 1 October 2011  Volume 6  Issue 10  e26896 Regulation of Type 1 Fimbriae Production by Lrp production in serovar Typhimurium [ 13 ] .
Thus an lrp - deletion mutant can not produce FimZ , and is blocked for type 1 fimbriation [ 33 ] .
Although , the mechanism for type 1 fimbriae production in bacteria has been extensively studied , no clear mechanism for onoff switching in response to environmental cues has been demonstrated .
We have proposed that dynamic change in cellular Lrp levels in response to nutritional state ( feast or famine ) is important for coordinating virulence traits in Salmonella [ 34 ] .
In this study , we address the effect of Lrp on type 1 fimbriation in Salmonella .
Results Lrp acts as both positive and negative regulator for fimA expression In our previous study using RT - PCR , we observed that an lrp C ( constitutive Lrp expression ) mutation abrogated fimA transcription [ 34 ] .
The lack of fimA expression in the lrp C strain was unexpected , since Lrp is known to be an indirect positive regulator for type 1 fimbriae production by enhancing expression of the positive regulator FimZ [ 33 ] .
To further define the role of Lrp in fimA expression , we determined the activity of P fimA using P fimA - lacZ fusions in wild - type strain x3761 , and isogenic Dlrp and lrp C mutant strains ( Table 1 ) by measuring the b - galactosidase activity in each of these strains after static , 24 h growth in LB - medium at 37uC ( Fig. 1A ) .
The lack of b - galactosidase synthesis in the Dlrp and lrp C mutant backgrounds indicates that transcription from P fimA is not active in the absence of Lrp or when Lrp is overproduced .
Next , we measured fimbriae production by determining the ability of static cultures of strains x3761 , x9411 ( Dlrp ) and x9448 ( lrp C ) to agglutinate yeast cells .
Wild - type cells displayed mannosesensitive agglutination , while both mutant strains were deficient in this phenotype ( Fig. 1B ) , consistent with our observations that no fimA transcript was detected in the strains .
We further confirmed Table 1 .

Typical type 1 fimbriae appendages were detected on the cell surface of wild - type strain x3761 , while no type 1 fimbriae were detected on the cell surface of the Dlrp or the lrp C strains ( data not shown ) .
These results demonstrate that deletion of lrp or overproduction of Lrp has a strong negative effect on type 1 fimbriae synthesis by directly influencing fimA transcription .
Lrp directly interacts with P fimA Based on our previously described consensus sequences [ 34 ] , we detected four putative Lrp - binding motifs in the P fimA region .
All four motifs are located upstream of the fimA transcription start site ( +1 ) [ 15 ] .
The DNA motifs 1 [ 2308 to 2301 ] , 2 [ 2112 to 2105 ] , and 3 [ 235 to 228 ] belong to Lrp - binding consensus IV , 59 - GNN ( N ) TTTT -39 [ 34,35 ] and DNA motif 4 [ 231 to 220 ] belongs to Lrp - binding consensus III , 59 - HNDWTTATTHND - 39 [ where H = not G ; W = A or T ; D = not C ; N = all bases ; and ( N ) = all bases or none ] [ 34 ] .
DNA motif 2 lies just upstream and motifs 3 and 4 lie just downstream of the FimZ binding site [ 298 to 247 ] [ 33 ] .
These observations led us to postulate that Lrp acts as both an activator and a repressor for type 1 fimbriae expression mediated by differential interactions with Lrp - P fimA , depending on cellular concentration of Lrp and on environmental conditions .
To address this hypothesis , we tested the direct interaction between Lrp and P fimA using the electrophoretic - mobility - shift assay ( EMSA ) .
Lrp directly interacted with P fimA in a concentrationdependent manner ( Fig. 2 ) .
These results are in contrast to the study by McFarland et al who did not detect an Lrp - P fimA interaction in gel shift assays [ 33 ] .
We noted differences in the binding buffer used in their study compared to ours .
Of particular interest was the fact that their binding buffer included MgCl 2 , while ours did not include divalent cations and , instead included EDTA to chelate any divalent cations present .
We performed the EMSA assay using McFarland 's binding buffer and , like McFarland et al , did not detect binding ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the magnesium concentration may play a role in regulating Lrp binding to P fimA .
A DNase I footprinting analysis was performed to elucidate in more detail the molecular nature of the Lrp - P fimA interaction with both coding ( Fig. 3A ) and non - coding ( Fig. 3B ) strands .
A 388 - bp DNA probe extending from -334 to +54 with respect to transcriptional start site ( +1 ) was used , which includes the entire P fimA region .
The footprint was estimated by densitometry comparing two lanes for 150 nM and 0 nM Lrp .
Sites protected from or hypersensitive to DNase I are summarized in Fig. 3C .
All four putative Lrp - binding motifs were protected by Lrp ( Fig. 3A and B ) .
We observed strong protection of the DNA region ( 2326 to 2257 ) containing the Lrp - binding motif 1 , while protection of the DNA regions ( 2123 to 2102 ; 259 to 233 ; and 226 to 26 ) of the Lrp - binding motifs 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively , was weaker .
The DNA region ( 25 to +4 ) in immediate downstream of the Lrpbinding motif 4 also showed weak protection .
The AT - rich overlapping region ( 234 to 228 ) within Lrp - binding motif 3 and 4 was highly resistant to DNase I digestion .
The FimZ - binding region partly overlapped with the Lrp - binding region ( 259 to 247 ) ( Fig. 3C ) .
This result suggests that both Lrp and FimZ competitively interact with the overlapped motif in P fimA .

None of tested DNA fragments showed non - specific degradation in the absence of DNase I ( data not shown ) .
Each of the Lrp - binding motifs in P fimA plays a distinct role in regulating type 1 fimbriae production To dissect the role of Lrp interactions with the promoter region of fimA , we constructed P fimA mutations , P fimA413 , P fimA529 , and P fimA1225 , designated a , b , and c , respectively , in the Lrp - binding motifs by site - directed mutagenesis ( Table 1 and Fig. 3C ) .
Our strategy for these mutations was to change multiple bases in each of the Lrp - binding motifs to increase the likelihood of disrupting the Lrp - DNA interaction and to reduce the likelihood of reversion .
In addition , the GC content ( 25 % or less ) of the Lrp - binding motifs was increased by the changes to achieve a GC content closer to the average for Salmonella , approximately 52 % [ 6 ] .
The GC content was raised to 50 % by the a and b mutations and to 44 % by the c mutation .
None of the changes affected bases known to be part of the RNA polymerase binding site for P fimA .
To determine the influence of the P fimA mutations on expression , we estimated the levels of mannose - sensitive fimbriae by a yeast agglutination assay , the synthesis of FimA by western blot , and fimA expression using chromosomal fimA - lacZ - fusions in strains carrying the promoter mutations ( Fig. 4 ) .
The P fimA413 ( a ) mutation had no significant effect on yeast agglutination , FimA synthesis or fimA transcription when compared to wild - type P fimA [ P fimA ( WT ) ] ( Fig. 4A and B ) .
In contrast , the P fimA529 ( b ) mutation resulted in a substantial increase in FimA synthesis ( Fig. 4A ) and a simultaneous increase in agglutination even at the lowest cell density used .
In contrast , the P fimA1225 ( c ) mutation resulted in loss of the agglutination phenotype and no detectable FimA synthesis on day 1 of growth ( Fig. 4A ) .
These results suggest that Lrpbinding motifs 1 and 2 in the P fimA region are involved in Lrpmediated activation and repression , respectively , of type 1 fimbrial gene expression .
Overall , the results from the lacZ fusion studies mirrored the yeast agglutination and western blot results ( Fig. 4A , 4B ) .
The double and triple mutants , P fimA1325 ( ac ) , P fimA1329 ( ab ) , P fimA2925 ( bc ) , and P fimA395 ( abc ) displayed wild - type levels of yeast agglutination on both day 1 and day 3 ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , we observed wide experiment - to - experiment variations in fimA expression on day 1 , as measured by b - galactosidase synthesis from the P fimA1225 ( c ) - lacZ fusion ( Fig. 4B ) .
Yeast agglutination results from the c mutant ( culture at day 1 ) were also variable among independent experiments ( data not shown ) .
Upon plating the c mutant cultures after three days of growth , we observed heterogeneous colony morphologies , including large and small colonies .
Some of the large colonies were purified and retested .
They appeared to be highly fimbriated , as they agglutinated yeast strongly after 24 hours of static growth and synthesized FimA ( data not shown ) , suggesting that they had acquired a suppressor mutation .
This observation could explain the variable data from the original c - lacZ - fusion mutant culture at day 1 ( Fig. 4B ) .
By day 3 , we observed strong yeast agglutination ( Fig. 4A ) and higher levels of b - galactosidase synthesis than wild type ( Fig. 4B ) , consistent with the accumulation of these highly fimbriated , faster - growing spontaneous mutants in the culture ( data not shown ) .
To determine whether or not the suppressor mutation was in the fim regulatory region , we picked four of these mutants and determined the DNA sequence of the entire promoter region .
However , we could not find any additional mutations in the P fimA1225 ( c ) DNA sequence from the suppressor mutants , indicating that the suppressor mutation is located elsewhere in the chromosome ( data not shown ) .
Each of the Lrp - binding motifs in P fimA contributes to Lrp - P fimA interaction To address the mechanism behind the Lrp - mediated dual ( activation/repression ) regulation , interactions between Lrp and each of the mutant fimA promoters were evaluated using EMSA .
Lrp binding to the the a , b , c , ac , ab , and bc ( single and double ) mutant promoters was indistinguishable from binding to P fimA ( WT ) regardless of Lrp concentrations .
In contrast , Lrp binding to the abc triple mutant promoter was impaired when the Lrp concentration was reduced to 100 nM or 50 nM ( Fig. 5 ) .
This indicates that each of the Lrp - binding motifs in P fimA contributes to Lrp - P fimA interactions .
Leucine had a minor effect on the band pattern , but we observed no significant effect on the binding affinity of Lrp to P fimA ( WT ) ( data not shown ) .
In addition , there was no significant effect of leucine on the Lrp - P fimA footprint ( data not shown ) .
Lrp acts as both positive and negative regulator of fimZ expression The increase in fimA expression observed in the b mutant ( Fig. 4B ) raised the possibility that the binding of Lrp to motif 2 , adjacent to the FimZ binding site ( Fig. 3C ) , may affect FimZ binding .
If the b mutation precluded Lrp binding , this could allow for greater accessibility of FimZ to its binding site in P fimA , thereby accounting for the observed hyper - fimbriation phenotype of the b mutant .
To address this possibility , we investigated whether the b mutation could relieve the observed repression of fimA in the lrp C mutant .
Therefore , we introduced the b mutation into the lrp C mutant and evaluated the resulting strain .
We found that introduction of the b mutation did not alleviate the Fim - phenotype in lrp C mutant ( Fig. 4 ) .
The new strain was essentially identical to the lrp C mutant carrying the P fimA ( WT ) .
It did not produce any detectable FimA ( Fig. 4A ) , did not agglutinate yeast cells , and no fimA transcription was detected from the b mutant promoter ( Fig. 4B ) .
Because FimZ is a positive activator of fimA expression , we assessed fimZ expression in the lrp C mutant by RT - PCR analysis .
We found that fimZ expression was undetectable in both the Dlrp and lrp C mutants ( Fig. 6A ) .
The results within the Dlrp mutant are consistent with previous observations that Lrp is a positive activator of fimZ [ 33 ] .
The lack of fimZ expression in the lrp C mutant indicates that Lrp can also act as a negative regulator of fimZ .

Effect of Lrp - binding motif mutations in P fimA on type 1 fimbriae production and b - galactosidase synthesis directed by P fimA promoter fusions in the indicated Salmonella strains .
Salmonella strains each harboring one of the P fimA mutations were statically grown in LB broth at 37uC for one day ( 24 h ) or 3 days .
Mannose - sensitive yeast agglutination assay and western blot analysis were performed to monitor fim expression in the single mutants ( A ) .
Agglutination was scored as follows : - , none ; + + , good ; + + + , strong ; and + + + + , very strong .

g004 independent ) fimZ can overcome the loss of type 1 fimbriae production in the lrp C mutant in both wild - type P fimA and P fimA529 ( b ) backgrounds ( Fig. 6B ) .
Therefore , it appears that even if Lrp binding is reduced at the Lrp - binding motif 2 when the b mutation is present , no fimA is expressed due to repression of fimZ .
In addition , positive regulation of fimA expression by FimZ is dominant over the negative regulation by Lrp when fimZ is overexpressed .
Both Lrp and FimZ independently bind to P fimA To gain greater insight into the regulation of fimA expression by Lrp and FimZ , we evaluated the binding of Lrp and FimZ to P fimA at several different molar ratios .
First , we confirmed that purified FimZ directly interacted with P fimA ( Fig. 7A ) .
When the concentration of FimZ was held constant at 50 nM , the intensity of shifted DNA - protein complex was increased by adding Lrp in a concentration dependent manner ( Fig. 7B ) .
Similarly , when the Lrp concentration was held constant at 50 nM , the intensity of shifted DNA - protein complex was increased by adding FimZ in a concentration dependent manner ( Fig. 7B ) .
In contrast to these conditions , in presence of Lrp ( 50 nM ) or FimZ ( 12.5 nM ) alone , the P fimA - Lrp or P fimA - FimZ complexes ran as a smear in the gel ( Fig. 7A and B ) .
These results indicate that both Lrp and FimZ independently bind to P fimA .
Although , DNase I footprinting analysis showed that the FimZ - binding motif partly overlapped with the Lrp - binding region ( Fig. 3B and C ) , we could not obtain any evidence for competitive binding of Lrp and FimZ to P fimA using EMSA .
In addition , in the presence of both Lrp and FimZ , PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 6 October 2011  Volume 6  Issue 10  e26896 Regulation of Type 1 Fimbriae Production by Lrp Figure 5 .

Reaction products were separated in a 5 % polyacrylamide gel .
Data presented are representative of two independent observations .
g005 we observed an increase in the apparent size of the P fimA ( WT ) complex ( supershift ) compared to the shift when each protein was present alone ( Fig. 7C ) .
To identify the Lrp - binding motif ( s ) responsible for the supershift , we estimated the binding of Lrp and Figure 6 .

g006 FimZ to each of the mutant promoters , P fimA413 ( a ) , P fimA529 ( b ) , and P fimA1225 ( c ) .
The c mutation in motif 1 abrogated the supershift of the DNA - protein complex , while the a and b mutations maintained the supershift ( Fig. 7C ) .
Remarkably , the a mutation led to a very strong supershift ( Fig. 7C ) .
These results indicate that the Lrp - binding motif 1 and the FimZ - binding motif in P fimA allow the supershifting of the P fimA complex by binding of both Lrp and FimZ to P fimA .
The cellular level of Lrp is a key factor for on/off switching of type 1 fimbriae production in serovar Typhimurium To examine Lrp - dependent on/off switching of type 1 fimbriae production , we employed S. Typhimurium strain x9449 harboring an arabinose - dependent Lrp expression system ( araC P BAD lacI and P trc lrp ) [ 34 ] .
In the presence of arabinose , lacI expression is induced and lrp expression , transcribed from the lacI - regulated P trc promoter , is repressed .
Conversely , in the absence - of - arabinose , no LacI is produced and Lrp is synthesized ( Fig. 8A ) .
In strain x9449 , Lrp synthesis and the ability to agglutinate yeast cells were dependent on the arabinose concentration in LB - medium ( Fig. 8A ) .
To evaluate whether the nutrition - dependent cellular Lrp levels are related to on - off switching of type 1 fimbriation , wild - type strain x3761 was statically grown in MOPS minimal broth , LB broth , and MOPS plus LB ( MOPS - LB ) broth mixed in several different ratios .
Cells from these cultures were harvested and tested for mannose - sensitive yeast agglutination .
Cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using anti - Lrp mouse serum .
As shown in Fig. 8B , Lrp synthesis was proportional to the nutritional content of the growth medium : with more Lrp produced under poor nutritional conditions and less Lrp produced under rich nutritional conditions .
Mannose - sensitive yeast agglutination was dramatically reduced in the Salmonella cells grown in MOPS minimal - medium , which is the condition generating the highest cellular Lrp level ( Fig. 8B ) .
Mannose - sensitive agglutination was partially recovered in the bacterial cells grown in MOPS minimal broth supplemented with 1 % ( v/v ) LB broth ( Fig. 8B ) .
The wildtype Salmonella completely recovered mannose - sensitive type 1 fimbriation in the MOPS - LB media containing 10 % ( v/v ) LB broth or more ( Fig. 8B ) .

The white arrowheads indicate super - shifted Lrp - P fimA - FimZ complexes .
To enhance resolution of the super - shifted DNA - protein complexes , the running time of the polyacrylamide gel in panel C was extended from 1 h ( used in panels A and B ) to 2 h. Schematic diagrams of the wild - type and mutant fimA promoters are shown under the gel .
g007 dependent intracellular Lrp concentration is important for regulating type 1 fimbriation .
To get a better sense of how much Lrp is present in cells , we estimated the number of Lrp molecules per cell when cells were grown in MOPS minimal broth , LB broth , and MOPS plus LB ( MOPS - LB ) broth mixed in several different ratios by comparing the western blot shown in Fig. 8B with a western blot loaded with known amounts of purified Lrp ( Fig. 8C ) .
Based on our densitometry calculations using the standard curve in Fig. 8C , the wild - type Salmonella strain x3761 produced about 6,000 Lrp molecules ( 3,000 dimers ) per cell when grown in MOPS minimal medium .
This is the same number of Lrp molecules calculated for E. coli cells grown in a glucose - based minimal - medium [ 36 ] .
The wild - type Salmonella strain x3761 produced about 2,000 Lrp molecules ( 1,000 dimers ) per cell in LB - medium , whereas the lrp C mutant produced about 12,000 Lrp molecules ( 6,000 dimers ) per cell grown in LB - medium ( data not shown ) .
In MOPS minimal medium supplemented with 10 % ( v/v ) LB , x3761 produced approximately 4,700 Lrp molecules ( 2,350 dimers ) per cell .
In addition , the regulated lrp - expression mutant x9449 produced about 900 Lrp dimers per cell when grown in LB - medium supplemented with 0.04 % or 0.2 % arabinose , and did not produce type 1 fimbriae .
These results indicate that S. Typhimurium is able to produce type 1 fimbriae at a range of cellular Lrp concentrations ( from 1,000 to 2,400 Lrp dimers per cell ) .
In MOPS minimal - medium supplemented with 1 % ( v/v ) LB , x3761 produced some type 1 fimbriae , as judged by the mannosesensitive yeast agglutination assay , even though this strain produced 3,000 Lrp dimers per cell , more than the 2,400 dimers per cell predicted to be the maximum number that would permit fimA transcription , based on growth in MOPS .
This result suggests that nutritional signals in LB broth may partially relieve the Lrpmediated repression of type 1 fimbriation at high cellular Lrp concentration .
Identification of the nutritional signals in LB medium remains to be addressed .
Discussion Lrp is required for synthesis - of - type - 1-fimbriae [ 33 ] .
Previous studies have shown that FimZ is required for fimA expression and Lrp is required for fimZ expression [ 33 ] .
Lrp binds to the fimZ promoter region and can thereby enhance fimZ expression [ 33 ] .
FimZ binds to P fimA and activates fimA expression .
Our previous report showed that while Dlrp mutants did not express fimA as expected , neither did lrp C mutants [ 34 ] .
To address the basis for these apparently contradictory phenomena , we investigated the role of Lrp in regulating type 1 fimbriae synthesis in more detail .
Using both genetic and molecular approaches , we found that high cellular levels of Lrp repressed fimA expression , with a concomitant loss of the type 1 fimbriae - associated mannose - sensitive agglutination phenotype ( Fig. 4 ) .
Under these conditions , production of FimZ is also abrogated ( Fig. 6 ) .
Site directed mutagenesis of putative Lrp - binding sites in the fimA promoter indicated that binding of Lrp to the fimA promoter is necessary for both activation and repression of type 1 fimbriae expression ( Fig. 4 ) .

Effect of cellular Lrp levels on type 1 fimbriae production in S. Typhimurium .
( A ) Western blot analysis for Lrp synthesis and mannose - sensitive yeast agglutination assay for the type 1 fimbriation in strain x9449 grown statically at 37uC for 24 h in LB medium supplemented with various arabinose concentrations .
( B ) Western blot analysis for Lrp synthesis and mannose - sensitive yeast agglutination assay in the wild - type strain x3761 grown statically in various combination of MOPS and LB media at 37uC for 24 h. Agglutination was scored as follows : - , no ; + / - , very weak ; + , weak ; and + + , good .
( C ) Preparation of standard curve for quantification of cellular Lrp levels by western blot analysis of purified Lrp ( 100 , 50 , and 25 ng ) using anti - Lrp antiserum and densitometry .
g008 The c mutation in the Lrp - binding motif 1 ( Fig. 3B ) abolished type 1 fimbriae synthesis , as judged by fimA expression and the yeast agglutination phenotype ( Fig. 4 ) .
These results suggest that Lrpbinding motif 1 in P fimA may play a crucial role in Lrp - mediated activation of type 1 production .
This notion is supported by the observation that the c mutation eliminates the formation of a supershifted band in the EMSA assay ( Fig. 7C ) , indicating that Lrp binds to motif 1 .
In addition , the supershifting of this DNA - protein complex suggests that both Lrp and FimZ binding to P fimA lead to a change in DNA topology , since Lrp changes DNA topology by DNAprotein and protein - protein interactions [ 37 ] .
This DNA topology change may contribute to activation of type 1 fimbriae production under normal growth - conditions in cells ( neither the absence nor overproduction of the regulators Lrp or FimZ ) .
The precise mechanism driving the activation of fimA transcription remains to be elucidated .
The b mutation in Lrp - binding motif 2 ( Fig. 3B ) enhanced fimA transcription and FimA synthesis ( Fig. 4 ) , indicating that the Lrpbinding motif 2 in P fimA is important for repression of type 1 fimbriae production .
Based on our results showing that Lrp binds to motif 2 ( Fig. 3B ) , we infer that repression via motif 2 is Lrpmediated .
Introduction of the lrp C mutation into the b mutant ( P fimA529 ) repressed fimA expression and eliminated any detectable yeast agglutination ( Fig. 6B ) .
This result is most easily explained by the lack of fimZ expression in these cells ( Fig. 6A ) , as the synthesis of type 1 fimbriae is restored by overexpression of fimZ ( Fig. 6B ) .
FimZ - dependent P fimA activation dominates the Lrp effect on P fimA when fimZ is overexpressed ( Fig. 6 ) and in fact , does not require Lrp when expressed from a multicopy plasmid [ 33 ] .
In contrast to the effects observed in the b and c mutants , the a mutation in Lrp - binding motif 3 and 4 had no effect on agglutination or on transcription of the P fimA : : lacZ fusion ( Fig. 4 ) .
The DNase I footprinting analysis showed that the protection region at Lrp - binding motif 3 and 4 partly overlapped with the FimZ - binding motif ( Fig. 3 ) .
This result suggests that Lrp and FimZ compete for binding to P fimA at the overlapping sites .
However , the EMSA results indicated that Lrp and FimZ independently bind to P fimA without competitive exclusion .
Many Lrp - regulated genes include multiple Lrp - binding motifs in their promoter region .
Cooperative binding of Lrp to these motifs is an important factor for Lrp - mediated gene regulation [ 38 ] .
Cooperative interactions between Lrp and other nucleoidbinding proteins such as H - NS are thought to repress transcription of some genes [ 39 ] .
While Lrp has been shown to act as a positive or negative regulator for each of the genes in the Lrp regulon , no systematic study of the mechanism has been undertaken .
Although it is unusual for Lrp to be both a positive and a negative regulator in the same operon , this type of dual regulation has been reported for the papBA operon [ 40 ] .
In that case , Lrp interacts with H - NS for repression and PapI for activation .
The P fimA region of S. Typhimurium includes four Lrp - binding motifs , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ( Fig. 3C ) .
Interestingly , three motifs are located immediately upstream ( motif 2 ) and downstream ( 3 and 4 ) of the FimZ - binding cis element in P fimA [ 33 ] .
Motif 1 is located far upstream ( 2308 to 2301 ) from the fimA transcription start site [ 15 ] .
Moreover , two potential high - affinity H - NS binding sites [ 41 ] , 59 - AAAATAAGA -39 ( 2100 to 292 ) and 59 - AT - TAAAAGA -39 ( 251 to 243 ) , are located immediate downstream of Lrp - binding motif 2 and upstream of Lrp - binding motif 3 , respectively , and overlap with the FimZ - binding site .
This observation suggests that Lrp binding to Lrp - binding motifs 2 and 3 may facilitate binding of the silencing protein H - NS .
Sitedirected mutagenesis revealed that motifs 1 ( distal locus for c mutation ) and 2 ( proximal locus for b mutation ) are important determinants for activation and repression , respectively , of type 1 fimbriae production ( Fig. 4 ) .
This result is consistent with previous reports that Lrp acts as a repressor when bound to motifs closer to or within the promoter and as an activator when bound to motifs further upstream [ 35,42 ] .
Similarly , we also found seven Lrpbinding motifs in the P fimZ region ( 603 - bp , between fimY stop codon and fimZ start codon ) ( data not shown ) .
Two motifs belong to Lrp - binding consensus III ( 59 - HNDWTTATTHND -39 ) and five motifs belong to Lrp - binding consensus IV ( 59 - PLoS ONE  www.plosone.org 9 October 2011  Volume 6  Issue 10  e26896 Regulation of Type 1 Fimbriae Production by Lrp GNN ( N ) TTTT -39 ) [ 34,35 ] .
Furthermore , three of the seven motifs in P fimZ are strong Lrp - binding DNA sequences as identified by DNA footprint analysis in a previous study [ 33 ] .
One Lrp - binding motif in P fimZ is also located far upstream ( 2353 to 2346 ) from the fimZ transcription start site [ 33 ] similar to motif 1inP fimA ( Fig. 3C ) .
A specific feature of the P fimZ region is that two Lrp - binding motifs are located between the transcription start site and the start codon of fimZ gene .
Although the double and triple mutations , P fimA1325 ( ac ) , P fimA1329 ( ab ) , P fimA2925 ( bc ) , and P fimA395 ( abc ) still can interact with Lrp , all of the multiple mutants produced wild - type levels of yeast agglutination on both day 1 and day 3 ( data not shown ) .
These results suggest that for Lrp to exert its regulatory effect , it must bind to at least two Lrpbinding motifs in P fimA .
In the absence of cooperative binding , as is the case in the double or triple mutants , P fimA expression would not be under direct Lrp control .
However , transcription from these mutant promoters is still sensitive to regulation by FimZ .
Thus these promoters can be activated by FimZ and produce wild - type levels of type 1 fimbriae when grown in LB broth .
In addition , we believe that the DNA motif 3 and 4 ( a mutation position ) can facilitate cooperative binding of Lrp to the DNA motif 1 and motif 2 , even if a mutation itself does not have any effect on type 1 fimbriae production .
Therefore , the effects of b and c mutations can be suppressed by adding a mutation .
These observations indicate that the cooperative binding of Lrp to multiple Lrpbinding motifs in P fimA is important for Lrp - mediated regulation of type 1 fimbriae production .
Based on results from site - directed mutagenesis of the multiple Lrp - binding motifs in P fimA , we assume that the organization ( proximity , number , and orientation ) of Lrp - binding motifs and their cooperative interaction with Lrp play a crucial role for on/off switching of the fimZ gene expression .
Saini et al. suggested that inhibition of fim gene expression occurs through the direct repression of P fimY by FimW , resulting in prevention of FimY - mediated fimZ activation [ 16 ] .
FimY is also a transcriptional activator for fimA , fimW , and itself [ 14,16 ] .
However , the positive and negative feedback loops are not sufficient to explain the regulation of type 1 fimbriae synthesis , since type 1 fimbriae synthesis under inducing conditions is continuous or rheostat - like rather than an autocatalytic or switchlike response [ 16 ] .
These observations suggest that expression of type 1 fimbriae in Salmonella cells is a collective and continuous event in response to environmental milieu .
These phenomena could be well explained if we assume that Lrp can act as both positive and negative regulators for type 1 fimbriae production depending on intracellular levels of Lrp , which are closely related with the nutritional environment [ 34,43 ] .
In addition , mannosesensitive yeast agglutination correlated with nutrition - dependent cellular Lrp levels ( Figs. 8A and B ) .
Based on the Lrp titration results from the western blot analyses in Fig. 7B , we conclude that mannose - sensitive type 1 fimbriation in Salmonella is inhibited by Lrp at a concentration of 3,000 or more Lrp dimers per cell ( Fig. 8B ) under nutrient - poor conditions .
However , mannosesensitive yeast agglutination was observed in Salmonella producing about 2,400 or fewer Lrp dimers per cell in nutrient - rich environments ( Fig. 8B ) .
We estimated that the lrp C mutant x9448 produces at least 6,000 Lrp dimers per cell grown in LB medium .
This cellular Lrp concentration is enough to inhibit type 1 fimbriae production , even when the Salmonella cells are grown in LB broth , a rich - medium .
Therefore , our results indicate that a narrow range of Lrp concentrations governs activation of fimA transcription and production of type 1 fimbriae .
Too much or too little Lrp results in no type 1 fimbriae production , allowing the cell to tightly regulate production of these complex extracellular structures in response to the nutritional environment .
Based on these data , we propose here a revised model for the fim gene regulatory circuit in S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 9A ) .
In our model , Lrp modulates expression of fimA and fimZ , either positively or negatively , depending on growth - conditions and the amount of Lrp present .
When Lrp is present in excess ( more than 3,000 dimers per cell ) , as is the case in the lrp C mutant or during - growth in nutritionpoor media , no fimZ is expressed , and Lrp binds to all four motifs 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 in P fimA resulting in complete repression of fimA ( Fig. 9B ) .
We assume that the binding of Lrp to motifs 2 and 3 may allow binding of the silencing factor H - NS to the high affinity H - NSbinding motifs in the FimZ - binding region , and competitively exclude FimZ binding to the P fimA .
This feature is similar to the collaborative competition mechanism in eukaryotic gene regulatory regions typically encompassing multiple DNA target sites for two or more regulatory proteins within a space of a few hundred base pairs or less [ 44 ] .
At a lower range of Lrp concentrations ( about 1,000,2400 dimers per cell ) , the levels of FimZ are high , such as occurs when cells are grown in nutrient - rich conditions ( e.g. LB broth ) , FimZ is better able to occupy its activation site in P fimA , presumably due to the fact the affinity of Lrp to motifs 2 , 3 , and 4 is relatively weak ( Fig. 3B ) and there is an abundance of FimZ .
Due to the requirement of motif 1 for FimA and type 1 fimbriae synthesis ( Fig 4 ) , we infer an interaction between Lrp and FimZ under these conditions that enhance FimZ - mediated activation of fimA expression by changing the regional DNA secondary structure .
Finally , in the Dlrp strain , neither fimZ nor fimA are expressed .
We conclude that Lrp is a key regulator to direct on - off switching of type 1 fimbriae production by the concentration - dependent dual regulation in S. Typhimurium in contrast to the recombination - mediated phase - variable type 1 fimbriation in E. coli .

Western blot analysis Protein bands from a 12 % SDS polyacrylamide gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane .
Western blot analysis was performed as previously described [ 51 ] .
