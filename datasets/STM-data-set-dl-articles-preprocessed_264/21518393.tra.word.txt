Summary Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 ( SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 ) play key roles in the pathogenesis of Salmonella enterica .
Previously , we showed that when Salmonella grows in LB - medium HilD , encoded in SPI - 1 , first induces the expression of hilA , located in SPI - 1 , and subsequently of the ssrAB operon , located in SPI - 2 .
These genes code for HilA and the SsrA/B two - component system , the positive regulators of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons , respectively .
In this study , we demonstrate that CsrA , a global regulatory RNA - binding protein , post - transcriptionally regulates hilD expression by directly binding near the Shine - Dalgarno and translation initiation codon sequences of the hilD mRNA , preventing its translation and leading to its accelerated turnover .
Negative regulation is counteracted by the global SirA/BarA two - component system , which directly activates the expression of CsrB and CsrC , two non - coding regulatory RNAs that sequester CsrA , thereby preventing it from binding to its target mRNAs .
Our results illustrate the integration of global and specific regulators into a multi - factorial regulatory cascade controlling the expression of virulence genes acquired by horizontal transfer events .

NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Salmonella are Gram - negative bacteria comprising around 2500 serotypes , many of which are important human and animal pathogens .
Two major clinical manifestations characterize Salmonella infections : enteritis ( salmonellosis ) , a self - limiting local intestinal inflammatory response , and enteric fever ( typhoid ) , a systemic infection characterized by the dissemination of the bacteria throughout the reticuloendothelial system via infected macrophages to the lymph nodes , liver and spleen ( Ohl and Miller , 2001 ; Haraga et al. , 2008 ) .
S. enterica serotype Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) can produce enteritis in humans , calves or chickens , whereas in mice it causes a systemic infection similar to human typhoid fever produced by serotype Typhi ( Ohl and Miller , 2001 ; Haraga et al. , 2008 ) ; thus it is frequently used as a model to study Salmonella pathogenesis .
Most of the Salmonella virulence genes are located within distinct genomic regions denominated Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands ( SPIs ) , which have been acquired by independent horizontal transfer events ( Groisman and Ochman , 1997 ; Marcus et al. , 2000 ) .
SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 , composed by 39 and 44 genes , respectively , play a key role in Salmonella pathogenesis ( Hansen - Wester and Hensel , 2001 ) .
Each pathogenicity island encodes a type three secretion system ( T3SS ) , different effector proteins , which are translocated into the host cells by their cognate T3SS , chaperones and transcriptional regulators that control the expression of the genes within each island ( Hensel , 2000 ; Marcus et al. , 2000 ; Hansen - Wester and Hensel , 2001 ) .
SPI - 1 genes are necessary for the invasion of epithelial host cells , thus for the intestinal colonization leading to enteritis ; whereas SPI - 2 genes are required for bacterial replication / survival inside macrophages , and thus for the systemic disease ( Hensel et al. , 1998 , Santos et al. , 2003 ; Haraga et al. , 2008 ) .
However , different studies have revealed that SPI - 2 genes also play a role in the development of the intestinal inflammatory disease and , accordingly , they are expressed in the intestinal lumen ( Bispham et al. , 2001 ; Brown et al. , 2005 ; Coburn et al. , 2005 ; Coombes et al. , 2005 ; Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ; Jones et al. , 2007 ) .
In vitro , SPI - 1 genes are expressed when Salmonella grows in the nutrient - rich - medium Luria - Bertani ( LB ) ( Lundberg et al. , 1999 ; Miao and Miller , 2000 ) , and are regulated by environmental conditions such as osmolarity , oxygen concentration and pH ( Altier , 2005 ; Jones , 2005 ; Ellermeier and Slauch , 2007 ) .
Under these growth - conditions , two AraC - like transcriptional regulators , HilD and HilC , encoded within SPI - 1 , activate hilA expression ( Schechter et al. , 1999 ; Schechter and Lee , 2001 , Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ) , the central positive regulator of SPI - 1 , by counteracting the repression exerted by the global repressor H - NS on the hilA promoter ( Schechter et al. , 2003 ; Olekhnovich and Kadner , 2006 ) .
HilA then directly activates expression of genes encoding T3SS components ( Eichelberg and Galan , 1999 ; Lostroh et al. , 2000 , Lostroh and Lee , 2001 ) , as well as the expression of another AraC - like transcriptional regulator , InvF ( Lostroh et al. , 2000 ) , which in turn activates the expression of genes encoding effector proteins ( Darwin and Miller , 1999 ; Eichelberg and Galan , 1999 ) .
The SPI - 2 genes are expressed during late stationary - phase when Salmonella grows in LB medium ( Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) or in acidic minimal media containing low concentrations of phosphate , calcium and magnesium ( Deiwick et al. , 1999 ; Miao and Miller , 2000 ) .
The SPI - 2-encoded SsrA/SsrB two - component regulatory system ( Cirillo et al. , 1998 , Deiwick et al. , 1999 ; Worley et al. , 2000 ) , controls the expression of the SPI - 2 regulon mainly by counteracting the repression exerted by H - NS on genes located within and outside the island ( Walthers et al. , 2007 ; Walthers et al. , 2010 ) .
In addition to these regulators , other regulatory proteins encoded outside of these islands have been shown to be involved in controlling the expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 Mol Microbiol .

NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Results Previous reports have shown that the global transcriptional regulator SirA positively controls the expression of the SPI - 1 genes ( Johnston et al. , 1996 ; Ahmer et al. , 1999 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) .
SirA is a member of the FixJ family of response regulators , forming a twocomponent regulatory system with the sensor kinase protein BarA ( Altier et al. , 2000b , Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) .
SirA/BarA orthologs are present in many bacteria , including E. coli ( UvrY/BarA ) , Pseudomonas species ( GacA/GacS ) , Vibrio cholerae ( VarA/VarS ) , Erwinia carotovora ( ExpA/ExpS ) and Legionella pneumoniae ( LetA/LetS ) , where they control the expression of genes associated with virulence , secondary metabolism , motility , exoenzyme production , quorum - sensing or biofilm formation ( Goodier and Ahmer , 2001 , Lapouge et al. , 2008 ) .
In E. coli , UvrY/BarA activates expression of two non - translated small RNAs , CsrB and CsrC , each of which contains several motifs recognized by the RNA binding protein CsrA ( Suzuki et al. , 2002 ; Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ; Babitzke and Romeo , 2007 ) .
CsrA is a homodimeric protein that binds to sequences overlapping the Shine - Dalgarno ( SD ) sequence in target mRNAs , thus blocking ribosome binding and translation , and promoting their degradation ( Baker et al. , 2002 ; Lucchetti - Miganeh et al. , 2008 , Timmermans and Van Melderen , 2010 ) .
CsrB and CsrC antagonize CsrA function by sequestering this protein , thus counteracting its translational repression activity ( Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ; Babitzke and Romeo , 2007 ; Lucchetti - Miganeh et al. , 2008 ; Timmermans and Van Melderen , 2010 ) .
Here we demonstrate that the SirA/BarA two - component system and the Csr posttranscriptional regulatory system regulate the expression of both the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes in Salmonella growing in LB - medium .
SirA activates the expression of CsrB and CsrC , which counteract the post - transcriptional repression exerted by CsrA , whose binding sites overlap the SD sequence and translation initiation codon of hilD mRNA .
HilD then activates expression of hilA and ssrAB , the genes encoding the central regulators of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 , respectively .
This study integrates a regulatory cascade constituted by global and horizontally acquired regulatory elements that controls the expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons .
SirA is involved in the expression of the SPI - 2 regulon Recently , we demonstrated that the SPI - 2 genes are expressed when S. Typhimurium grows in the nutritionally rich - medium LB ( Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) .
Under this growth - condition the SPI - 1-encoded regulator HilD activates the sequential expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons at the early and late stationary - phases of growth , respectively .
In this study , we investigated the possibility that , in addition to HilD , other reported SPI - 1 regulators could be involved in controlling the expression of SPI - 2 genes .
Previous studies have shown that the global SirA/BarA two - component system positively regulates the expression of SPI - 1 ( Johnston et al. , 1996 , Ahmer et al. , 1999 ; Altier et al. , 2000b ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) and SPI - 4 genes ( Gerlach et al. , 2007 ) .
To investigate if SirA also regulates the SPI - 2 genes , we analyzed the expression of a transcriptional - fusion of the ssaG ( SPI - 2 ) promoter to the cat ( chloramphenicol acetyl transferase ) reporter gene , in wild type ( WT ) S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 and its ΔsirA derivative , as well as in the ΔhilC , ΔhilA , ΔhilD , ΔompR and ΔssrB mutants .
Each strain was grown in LB or in N - minimal - medium ( N - MM ) , two different in - vitro growth conditions shown to sustain the expression of SPI - 2 genes ( Deiwick et al. , 1999 ; Miao and Miller , 2000 ; Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) .
Expression of ssaG - cat showed a similar reduction in the ΔsirA and ΔhilD mutants grown in LB with respect to the WT strain ( Fig. 1A ) , but Mol Microbiol .
Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 June 1 .
Page 4 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript was not affected when they were grown in N - MM ( Fig. 1B ) .
These results are consistent with our previous observations indicating that HilD is required for the expression of the SPI - 2 genes when Salmonella grows in LB but not in N - MM ( Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) .
Also in accordance with our previous results ( Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) , expression of ssaG was reduced in both LB and N - MM in the ΔompR and ΔssrB mutants , which lack the SPI - 2 regulators OmpR and SsrB .
In contrast , expression was not affected in the ΔhilA and ΔhilC mutants that lack the SPI - 1 regulators HilA and HilC ( Figs. 1A and B ) .
As a control , we determined the expression of a hilA - cat transcriptional - fusion in the same strains grown in LB .
In agreement with previous studies showing that both SirA and HilD positively regulate hilA ( SPI - 1 ) expression ( Johnston et al. , 1996 ; Ahmer et al. , 1999 ; Schechter et al. , 1999 ; Schechter and Lee , 2001 ; Schechter et al. , 2003 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ; Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ; Olekhnovich and Kadner , 2006 ) , expression of the hilA - cat fusion was reduced in the ΔsirA and ΔhilD mutants , but was not affected in the ΔompR , ΔssrB and hilC mutants ( Fig. 1C ) .
Furthermore , expression of the hilA - cat fusion increased in the ΔhilA mutant ( Fig. 1C ) , consistent with a previous study showing that HilA negatively regulates its own expression ( De Keersmaecker et al. , 2005 ) .
Taken together , these results indicated that SirA , in addition to HilD , OmpR and SsrB , is required for the expression of SPI - 2 genes when Salmonella grows in LB .
To determine if SirA controls ssaG expression , and thus of other SPI - 2 genes , by regulating the ssrAB operon , we analyzed the expression of SsrB in WT and ΔsirA strains , as well as in the ΔhilA , ΔhilD , ΔhilC , and ΔompR mutants , which were tested as controls .
To follow the expression of SsrB , the ssrB chromosomal gene was tagged with the sequence encoding a 3XFLAG epitope , rendering strains expressing a C - terminal 3XFLAG - tagged SsrB protein ( SsrB - FLAG ) .
Total protein extracts were obtained from culture samples of these strains grown in LB and analyzed by western blotting .
In agreement with the results shown in Fig. 1A , expression of SsrB - FLAG was drastically reduced in the ΔsirA , ΔhilD and ΔompR mutants , but not in the ΔhilA and ΔhilC mutants ( Fig. 1D ) .
In contrast , when these strains were grown in N - MM , SsrB - FLAG expression was not affected in the ΔsirA and ΔhilD mutants , but was still highly reduced in the ΔompR mutant ( data not shown ) .
Together , these results indicated that expression of the SsrA/B system and , as a consequence , the SPI - 2 genes requires the HilD , OmpR and SirA proteins when S. Typhimurium is grown in LB .
SirA controls the expression of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes by regulating HilD expression HilD and OmpR positively regulate ssrAB expression by directly binding to its regulatory region ( Lee et al. , 2000 ; Feng et al. , 2003 , 2004 ; Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) .
Since the expression of OmpR was not affected in the absence of SirA or HilD ( data not shown ) , we hypothesized that SirA could regulate the expression of the ssrAB operon directly , acting along with HilD and OmpR , or indirectly by controlling the expression of HilD in a cascade fashion .
To distinguish between these possibilities , we first analyzed the expression of SsrB - FLAG by western blot in the ΔhilD and ΔsirA mutants containing plasmids pBAD - HilD1 or pBAD - SirA1 , expressing HilD and SirA , respectively .
Expression of HilD from plasmid pBAD - HilD1 restored the expression of SsrB - FLAG in both the ΔhilD and ΔsirA mutants to a level that was similar to the WT strain ( Fig. 2A ) .
In contrast , expression of SirA from plasmid pBAD - SirA1 only restored the expression of SsrB - FLAG in the ΔsirA mutant ( Fig. 2A ) .
Similar results were obtained when the expression of a C - terminal 3XFLAG - tagged HilA protein ( HilA - FLAG ) or of the hilA - cat fusion was determined in the same genetic backgrounds containing plasmids expressing HilD or SirA ( Figs. 2B and S1 ) .
These results show that HilD is able to activate the expression of ssrAB and hilA in the absence of SirA , whereas SirA requires the presence of HilD , suggesting that SirA controls HilD expression , which in turn directly regulates hilA and ssrAB .
In agreement with this notion , the presence of pT3 - HilD1 , but not of pK3 - SirA1 , activated expression of hilA - cat , Mol Microbiol .

Page 5 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript hilC - cat and rtsA - cat transcriptional - fusions in the absence of any other Salmonella - specific regulatory protein , as it was determined in an E. coli Δ uvrY mutant lacking UvrY , the E. coli ortholog of SirA ( Fig .
In contrast , expression of a csrB - cat transcriptional - fusion was activated in the presence of pK3 - SirA1 , but not of pT3 - HilD1 ( Fig .
These results are in agreement with previous studies showing that HilD directly regulates hilA , hilC and rtsA ( Schechter et al. , 1999 ; Schechter and Lee , 2001 ; Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ) and that SirA directly controls the expression of csrB ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 , Teplitski et al. , 2006 ) .
The results described above suggest that the SirA/BarA system controls HilD expression .
To further determine the extent to which the SirA/BarA system controls hilD expression , we analyzed the activity of a hilD - cat transcriptional - fusion and measured hilD mRNA levels by q - RT - PCR in WT , ΔsirA and ΔbarA strains .
As HilD has also been reported to positively regulate its own expression ( Olekhnovich and Kadner , 2002 ; Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ) , the expression of hilD was also tested in the hilD mutant .
Expression of ΔhilD was similarly reduced in the ΔsirA and ΔbarA mutants and to a greater extent in the ΔhilD mutant ( Figs. 3A and B ) .
These results , together with those from previous studies ( Lucas and Lee , 2001 ; Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ; Mizusaki et al. , 2008 ) , demonstrate that the SirA/BarA system positively regulates the expression of hilD .
SirA binds to the csrB and csrC regulatory regions , but not to those of hilD , hilA , hilC or ssrAB The results described above are consistent with the notion that SirA acts through HilD to indirectly control the expression of hilA and ssrAB .
In this regard , results from a previous study suggested that SirA most likely acts along with HilD or through HilD to control hilA expression and thus SPI - 1 regulation ( Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ) .
Moreover , it is known that SirA regulates the expression of csrB and csrC and that these non - coding RNAs positively regulate Salmonella invasion and expression of SPI - 1 genes ( Altier et al. , 2000b ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ; Fortune et al. , 2006 ; Teplitski et al. , 2006 ) .
However , it has also been shown that SirA binds to the regulatory regions of hilA and csrB , but that it does not bind to the regulatory regions of hilD and csrC ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 , Teplitski et al. , 2006 ) .
To further dissect and clarify the mechanism by which SirA regulates the expression of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes , we analyzed the interaction of this protein with the regulatory regions of genes under the control of the SirA cascade .
SirA was purified as an MBP - SirA fusion protein expressed from plasmid pMAL - SirA1 ( as described in Experimental Procedures section in Supporting Information ) .
SPI - 1 protein secretion was restored in the ΔsirA mutant carrying plasmid pMAL - SirA1 ( data not shown ) , confirming the functionality of MBP - SirA .
Binding of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated purified MBP - SirA to a 32 P - 5 ' - end - labeled PCR product spanning the regulatory region of csrB was tested by electrophoretic - mobility - shift assays ( EMSAs ) to further verify the functionality of the fusion protein .
MBP - SirA similarly shifted the csrB fragment whether it was phosphorylated or not , starting at a concentration of 1.5 µM ( Fig .
S3A ) , indicating that MBP - SirA phosphorylation is not required for DNA binding in - vitro , which is consistent with previous results showing that phosphorylation only increases the DNA - binding affinity of SirA - His6X by approximately twofold ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) .
SirA phosphorylation in - vivo seems to be critical for its function , since when its predicted phosphorylated residue , Asp54 , is substituted for an alanine , or in the absence of its cognate sensor kinase BarA , csrB expression is not induced ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , it is likely that the in - vitro conditions used to test SirA DNA - binding , or the fusion of SirA to the MBP or to the His6X tag , rendered a SirA protein that specifically binds to its target DNA sequences regardless of its phosphorylation state .

Page 6 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript In contrast , a DNA fragment containing the regulatory region of sigD , which was used as a negative control , was not shifted even at a concentration of 3 µM ( Fig .
Specific binding was confirmed by competing MBP - SirA binding to the labeled csrB fragment with 10 - to 50 - fold excess of unlabeled specific ( csrB ) and nonspecific ( sigD ) fragments by EMSA .
As shown in figure S3B , only the unlabeled csrB fragment was able to compete with the interaction of MBP - SirA with the labeled fragment of csrB .
We next performed EMSA s with phosphorylated MBP - SirA and labeled DNA fragments containing the regulatory regions of hilD , hilA , hilC , ssrAB and csrC .
The DNA fragments used for the EMSAs were those used to construct the corresponding transcriptional - fusions that showed SirA - mediated regulation ( Figs. 5 and S4 ) .
The fragments spanning the hilD , hilA , hilC , ssrAB and sigD regulatory regions were not shifted by phosphorylated MBP - SirA up to a concentration of 3 µM ( Figs. 4A -- D ) .
Similar results were obtained using nonphosphorylated MBP - SirA ( data not shown ) .
At higher concentrations ( ≥ 5 µM ) , phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated MBP - SirA bound to all of these fragments , including sigD , suggesting that MBP - SirA binds nonspecifically at these concentrations ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , csrC was bound by MBP - SirA , starting at a concentration of 2 µM ( Fig. 4E ) .
Specific binding to the csrC regulatory region was also confirmed by competitive EMSAs , as described above for csrB .
Only a 10 - to 50 - fold excess of unlabeled csrC fragment , but not of the unlabeled nonspecific sigD fragment , was able to disrupt the interaction of MBP - SirA with the csrC labeled fragment ( Fig. 4F ) , confirming the specific binding of MBP - SirA to csrC .
SirA - mediated regulation of csrB and csrC in the strain used in this study ( S. Typhimurium SL1344 ) , was confirmed by analyzing the expression of csrBcat and csrC - cat transcriptional - fusions in the WT and ΔsirA strains ( Fig .
The lack of binding of MBP - SirA to the hilD , hilA and ssrAB regulatory regions is in agreement with the genetic evidence indicating that the SirA/BarA system regulates the expression of hilD , and thus of ssrAB and hilA , indirectly .
In contrast , specific binding of MBP - SirA to both the csrB and csrC regulatory regions supports the notion that the SirAmediated expression of hilD is regulated by the Csr system .
SirA controls the expression of HilD through the CsrB and CsrC RNA molecules In other bacteria , SirA/BarA orthologs control gene expression in a cascade fashion by directly activating the expression of csrB and csrC , encoding the small untranslated RNA molecules CsrB and CsrC , respectively ( Babitzke and Romeo , 2007 ; Lapouge et al. , 2008 ; Lucchetti - Miganeh et al. , 2008 ) .
Therefore , to determine if SirA regulates expression of hilD and the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes through CsrB and CsrC , single ΔcsrB and ΔcsrC mutants , as well as a ΔcsrB ΔcsrC double mutant , were constructed as described in Experimental Procedures .
Expression of the hilDcat ( SPI - 1 ) , hilA - cat ( SPI - 1 ) , ssrAB - cat ( SPI - 2 ) and ssaG - cat ( SPI - 2 ) transcriptional - fusions was determined in these mutants and compared with their expression in WT and ΔsirA strains ; additionally , the level of the hilD mRNA was measured by q - RT - PCR .
Expression of hilD was not appreciably affected in the single ΔcsrB or ΔcsrC mutants ; however , expression in the ΔcsrB ΔcsrC double mutant strain was reduced to the level observed in the ΔsirA mutant ( Figs. 5A and B ) .
As expected , expression of the hilA , ssrAB and ssaG fusions was also reduced in the ΔcsrB ΔcsrC double mutant and in the ΔsirA mutant , but not in the single ΔcsrB and ΔcsrC mutants ( Fig. 5C and data not shown ) .
Furthermore , the secretion of the SPI - 1-encoded proteins SipA , SipB , SipC and SipD ( Fig. 5D , upper ) , as well as the expression of the SPI - 2-encoded effector protein SseB ( Fig. 5D , lower ) , were considerably reduced in the ΔcsrB ΔcsrC double mutant and , as expected , in the ΔsirA mutant , but not in the single ΔcsrB and ΔcsrC mutants .
In agreement with these results , a previous study reported that the expression of hilA and sipC ( a SPI - 1 gene ) , decreased in a ΔcsrB ΔcsrC Mol Microbiol .
Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 June 1 .
Page 7 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript double mutant , while it was not affected in ΔcsrB and ΔcsrC single mutants ( Fortune et al. , 2006 ) .
It has been demonstrated that the loss of CsrB causes a compensatory increase in CsrC levels and vice versa ( Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ; Fortune et al. , 2006 ) , which probably explains why the ΔcsrB ΔcsrC double mutant , but not the single mutants , affected expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes .
To further investigate if SirA acts only through CsrB/C or has an additional CsrB/Cindependent regulatory role on the expression of hilD or the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes , we analyzed the expression of the hilD - cat , hilA - cat and ssaG - cat fusions in the ΔsirA mutant containing plasmids pMPM - K3 ( empty vector ) or pK3 - CsrB1 , expressing CsrB from a constitutive promoter .
Expression of hilD , hilA and ssaG was restored in the ΔsirA mutant , but not in the ΔhilD mutant , in the presence of pK3 - CsrB1 ( Figs. 6A -- C ) .
In agreement with the notion that SirA controls the expression of hilD and , as a consequence , of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes through CsrB/C , a plasmid expressing SirA was not able to restore the secretion of the SPI - 1-encoded proteins ( Fig. 7 , upper ) , or the expression of the SPI - 2-encoded SseB protein ( Fig. 7 , lower ) , in a ΔsirA ΔcsrBΔcsrC triple mutant .
In contrast , SPI - 1-mediated protein secretion and the expression of SseB , were restored by a plasmid expressing HilD in this triple mutant ( Fig. 7 ) .
Taken together , these results support the model in which SirA indirectly regulates hilD expression , and thus the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes , by directly activating transcription of csrB and csrC .
CsrA represses expression of HilD by binding to the hilD leader transcript In E. coli , CsrB and CsrC regulate gene expression by binding to and sequestering the RNA binding protein CsrA , thus counteracting the negative posttranscriptional control exerted by CsrA on its target mRNAs ( Babitzke and Romeo , 2007 ; Lucchetti - Miganeh et al. , 2008 ; Timmermans and Van Melderen , 2010 ) .
To evaluate the regulatory role of CsrA on the expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes , we first analyzed the expression of these genes when CsrA is overexpressed .
As CsrB and CsrC antagonize CsrA activity , the phenotypes associated with CsrA overexpression was predicted to mimic the phenotypes observed in the ΔcsrB ΔcsrC double mutant strain .
The transcriptional activity of the hilD - cat , hilA - cat and ssrAB - cat , as well as of the sirA - cat , csrB - cat and csrC - cat transcriptional - fusions was determined in a WT strain containing plasmids pMPM - K3 ( empty vector ) or pK3 - CsrA1 .
Additionally , the level of the hilD mRNA was measured by q - RT - PCR and the expression of HilA - FLAG and SsrB - FLAG proteins was determined by Western blot , in these same genetic backgrounds .
Overproduction of CsrA drastically reduced the expression of hilD , hilA and ssrAB ( Figs. 8A , B and E ) ; while the expression of sirA , csrB and csrC was not affected ( Figs. 8C and D ) .
Furthermore , the presence of pK3 - CsrA1 drastically reduced the expression of HilA - FLAG and SsrB - FLAG , as well as the secretion of the SPI - 1-encoded proteins in WT S. Typhimurium ( Fig. 8F and data not shown ) .
To further confirm the role of CsrA , we analyzed the expression of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes in a csrA deletion mutant ( Table 1 ) carrying the hilD - cat , hilA - cat , ssrAB - cat , sirA - cat , csrBcat and csrC - cat reporter fusions .
The level of the hilD mRNA was also measured by q - RT - PCR in this mutant .
Consistent with the observed negative regulatory role of csrA overexpression , expression of hilD , hilA and ssrAB significantly increased in the ΔcsrA mutant ( Figs. 8A , B and E ) , whereas the expression of the sirA , csrB and csrC was not affected ( Figs. 8C and D ) .
In agreement with these results , it was previously shown that overproduction of CsrA reduced the expression of hilD and hilA ( Altier et al. , 2000a ) .
This study also reported the generation of a csrA mutant in S. Typhimurium strain 14028s , which surprisingly showed a reduction in the expression of SPI - 1 genes ; however , this mutant presented a severe growth defect , which may have affected the growth - phase - dependent induction of the SPI - 1 genes .

Page 8 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Our ΔcsrA mutant showed a less severe growth defect , which was restored when CsrA was expressed in trans ( Fig .
It remains to be seen if the different effects on growth and on the expression of SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes caused by the absence of CsrA could also be attributed to distinct features of the strains used , SL1344 ( this study ) and 14028s ( Altier et al. , 2000a ) , or to random secondary suppressor mutations acquired as a consequence of eliminating a pleiotropic regulatory protein .
The results described above , indicating that SirA/BarA and CsrB/C activate expression of hilA and ssrAB through HilD , also suggested that CsrA could directly repress hilD expression .
To test this possibility , we performed EMSAs to determine whether CsrA binds to hilD , hilA , ssrAB or csrB transcripts .
The addition of 1 µM CsrA led to reduced mobility of the hilD , ssrAB and csrB transcripts , indicating that CsrA bound to these RNAs ( Fig. 9A ) .
In contrast , CsrA did not bind to hilA RNA ( Fig. 9A ) .
We next performed experiments to determine the affinity of CsrA for hilD , ssrAB and csrB mRNAs .
CsrA bound to the hilD transcript as a distinct band ( Fig. 9B ) .
A nonlinear least - squares analysis of these data yielded an apparent K d value of 5 nM CsrA for hilD mRNA .
The specificity of CsrA - hilD RNA interaction was investigated by performing competition experiments with specific ( hilD ) and non - specific ( E. coli phoB ) unlabeled RNA competitors .
Unlabeled hilD was an effective competitor , whereas phoB did not compete with the CsrA - hilD RNA interaction ( Fig. 9B ) .
These results establish that CsrA binds specifically to the hilD transcript .
Similar binding experiments were performed with the ssrAB and csrB transcripts .
The affinity of CsrA for ssrAB mRNA ( K d = 340 nM ) was much lower than for hilD .
In addition , while unlabeled ssrAB RNA was able to compete with the labeled transcript for CsrA binding , it did so poorly ( Fig. 9C ) .
As expected , CsrA bound specifically to csrB mRNA with high affinity ( K d = 20 pM ) .
Moreover , multiple shifted species were observed ( Fig. 9D ) .
While the stoichiometry of the shifted complexes was not examined , the first shifted species likely contains one CsrA dimer bound per transcript , with the slower migrating species containing multiple CsrA molecules bound to each transcript .
Footprint experiments were then performed to identify the CsrA binding site ( s ) in the hilD and ssrAB transcripts using RNase T1 as a probe ( cleaves following single - stranded G residues ) .
CsrA protected five G residues in the hilD transcript that overlapped the hilD SD sequence and translation initiation codon ( Fig. 9E ) .
As both of these regions contain the highly conserved GGA motif ( Fig. 9E ) , it is apparent that CsrA binds to two sites in this transcript .
These results indicate that CsrA represses hilD expression , presumably by blocking 30S ribosomal subunit binding .
CsrA also protected several G residues in the ssrAB transcript that overlapped its SD sequence ( data not shown ) .
Thus , it appears that CsrA is also capable of directly repressing ssrAB translation by binding to a single site in the ssrAB transcript , although the reduced affinity of CsrA for this RNA suggests that repression would be less extensive than for hilD .
By blocking ribosome binding and translation , CsrA - mediated translational repression often leads to accelerated degradation of target transcripts ( Babitzke and Romeo , 1997 ; Lucchetti - Miganeh et al. , 2008 , Timmermans and Van Melderen , 2010 ) .
Therefore , we tested whether bound CsrA accelerated hilD mRNA decay .
The half - life of hilD mRNA was determined in WT and csrA strains .
To facilitate detection of hilD mRNA , the two strains were transformed with plasmid pT3 - HilD1 , which carries the hilD gene under the control of a constitutive promoter , to increase the cellular concentration of the hilD transcript .
These strains were grown to mid - exponential - phase in LB ; then , transcription was inhibited by adding rifampicin .
Culture samples were collected at different time - points after addition of the drug for RNA extraction and analysis by Northern blotting .
The hilD mRNA was detected as two unique bands , which showed similar intensity in the WT and ΔcsrA mutant strains immediately after the treatment with rifampicin ( Fig. 9F ) .
However , the hilD mRNA Mol Microbiol .

NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Discussion Taken together , it can be concluded that CsrA - mediated translational repression leads to more rapid degradation of hilD mRNA .
In addition , by reducing HilD synthesis , CsrA would also affect HilD positive autoregulation ( Olekhnovich and Kadner , 2002 ; Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ) , thus reducing hilD transcription .
Furthermore , our results suggest that CsrA indirectly represses hilA and ssrAB transcription under growth - conditions that favor HilDdependent activation of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons .
In recent years it has become more evident that the mechanisms regulating virulence gene expression in Salmonella are more complex than previously thought .
A myriad of regulatory factors and environmental cues have been shown to be part of the molecular events leading to the appropriate spatiotemporal expression of the genes that integrate the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons ( Altier , 2005 ; Jones , 2005 ; Ellermeier and Slauch , 2007 ; Fass and Groisman , 2009 ) .
In this regard , we recently provided evidence showing that HilD is a key regulatory protein that establishes transcriptional cross - talk between the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons , by sequentially activating expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes when Salmonella grows in LB - medium ( Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) .
HilD directly binds to the regulatory regions of hilA and the ssrAB operon , thereby interfering with H - NS - mediated repression of their promoters .
HilA and the SsrA/B two component system , in turn , activate the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons , respectively ( Schechter et al. , 2003 ; Olekhnovich and Kadner , 2006 ; Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) .
Interestingly , HilD is not required for expression of the ssrAB operon when Salmonella grows in minimal media containing low concentrations of magnesium and phosphate ( Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) .
Under these growth - conditions ssrAB expression instead depends on other regulators such as OmpR , PhoP and SlyA ( Lee et al. , 2000 ; Feng et al. , 2003 ; 2004 ; Bijlsma and Groisman , 2005 ; Linehan et al. , 2005 ; Fass and Groisman , 2009 ) .
Based on previous knowledge ( Johnston et al. , 1996 ; Ahmer et al. , 1999 ; Goodier and Ahmer , 2001 ; Altier et al. , 2000a ; 2000b ; Lawhon et al. , 2003 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ; Fortune et al. , 2006 ; Teplitski et al. , 2006 ) and new information generated from this study , we present the integration of the regulatory cascade that controls expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 virulence regulons via the SirA/BarA and Csr global regulatory systems and the Salmonella - specific regulator HilD .
Firstly , we demonstrated that SirA positively controls expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes through HilD .
A previous study reported that SirA - His 6 bound to a region located downstream of the hilA promoter and the regulatory region of hilC ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 ) , suggesting a direct SirA regulation of these SPI - 1 genes .
In contrast , we found that MBP - SirA specifically bound to the regulatory regions of csrB and csrC , but not to the regulatory regions of hilA and hilC containing the fragments used by Teplitski et al. , 2003 ( Figs. 4 and S3 ) .
Differences in these results could be attributed to different DNA binding specificities between SirA - His 6 and MBP - SirA , or other technical differences ; however , the genetic evidence presented here supports the notion that SirA does not directly activate hilA .
Briefly , we demonstrated that SirA can not activate expression of SsrB and HilA proteins in the absence of HilD ( Figs. 2 , S1 and S2 ) , in agreement with results from a previous study ( Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ) .
In contrast , HilD activated expression of ssrAB and hilA in the absence of SirA , indicating that HilD does not require the presence of SirA to directly activate expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulatory genes .
In agreement with our results , mathematical models considering that SirA regulates SPI - 1 genes through HilD are able to Mol Microbiol .

However , they fail to predict the level of participation of intermediate components of the SPI - 1 regulatory cascade , when considering a direct regulation of SirA on hilA or hilC ( Ganesh et al. , 2009 ) .
Furthermore , CsrB was able to restore the expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes in the absence of SirA , but not in the absence of HilD ( Fig. 6 ) , indicating that SirA acts through CsrB to regulate these genes , and that HilD is downstream of SirA and CsrB in the regulatory cascade controlling them .
This is consistent with previous studies indicating that SirA orthologs regulate gene expression through the corresponding CsrB and CsrC orthologs ( Babitzke and Romeo , 2007 ; Lucchetti - Miganeh et al. , 2008 ; Brencic et al. , 2009 ; Timmermans and Van Melderen , 2010 ) .
In this regard , we demonstrated that SirA specifically binds to the csrC regulatory region ( Fig. 4 ) , an interaction previously demonstrated only for csrB ( Teplitski et al. , 2003 ; Teplitski et al. , 2006 ) .
Moreover , the demonstration that CsrA binds to the SD sequence and translation initiation codon of hilD mRNA , but not to hilA mRNA ( Fig. 9 ) , strongly correlates with the genetic and biochemical data indicating that regulation of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons require direct activation of csrB and csrC by SirA , which in turn overcomes CsrA - dependent repression of HilD synthesis .
HilD is then responsible for the direct activation of hilA and ssrAB and , indirectly , of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons .
Additionally , we found that CsrA binds to ssrAB mRNA , but with a much lower affinity than to hilD mRNA ( Kd = 340 nM vs 5 nM ) ( Fig. 9 ) .
Whether this weak CsrA - ssrAB RNA interaction is capable of regulating ssrAB expression remains to be determined .
However , as expression of ssrAB requires HilD when Salmonella grows in LB - medium , CsrA - mediated regulation of HilD synthesis appears to be the primary mechanism by which CsrA controls ssrAB expression .
Moreover , SPI - 2 expression was not significantly affected in the ΔsirA mutant growing in N - MM ( Fig. 1 ) , which favors HilD - independent activation of ssrAB .
A model for the regulatory cascade that controls expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons , which summarizes our results and those from other groups , is shown in Figure 10 .
This regulatory cascade is under the influence of catabolite - repression , through the positive control of SirA expression exerted by the cAMP receptor protein CRP ( Teplitski et al. , 2006 ) .
The regulatory cascade can also be activated by short - chain - fatty - acids , such as acetate , formate and propionate , which stimulate the sensor kinase activity of BarA , and thus phosphorylation of SirA orthologs ( Chavez et al. , 2010 ) .
Alternatively , acetyl - phosphate seems to directly phosphorylate the response regulator SirA or the sensor kinase BarA ( Altier et al. , 2000b ; Lawhon et al. , 2002 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ; 2006 ) .
Acetyl - phosphate can be generated from acetate , which is commonly found in the distal ileum of the mammalian intestines .
Within the bacteria , acetate is converted to acetyl - phosphate by acetate kinase ( ackA ) , and , presumably , can also be produced endogenously from acetyl - CoA by phosphotransacetylase ( pta ) ( Lawhon et al. , 2002 ; Teplitski et al. , 2006 ) .
Phosphorylated SirA activates expression of CsrB and CsrC by binding to the csrB and csrC regulatory regions .
These RNA molecules , in turn , bind to and sequester CsrA ( Babitzke and Romeo , 2007 ; Lucchetti - Miganeh et al. , 2008 ; Timmermans and Van Melderen , 2010 ) , thus counteracting CsrA - mediated translational repression of hilD .
The appropriate concentration and activity of HilD is maintained by additional negative and positive regulatory mechanisms , including degradation of HilD mediated by the Lon protease ( Boddicker and Jones , 2004 ; Takaya et al. , 2005 ) , HilD inactivation by direct interaction with HilE ( Baxter et al. , 2003 ) , positive auto - regulation of HilD , as well as by a feed forward positive regulatory loop involving the HilD , HilC and RtsA AraC - like regulators ( Olekhnovich and Kadner , 2002 ; Ellermeier et al. , 2005 ) .
The regulatory cascade diverges when HilD , in a growth phase - dependent manner , activates expression of hilA and the ssrAB operon , by counteracting the repression exerted by H - NS on their promoters ( Bustamante et al. , 2008 , Schechter et al. , 2003 ; Olekhnovich and Kadner , 2006 ) .
Finally , HilA and the SsrA/B system positively control expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 regulons , respectively ( Altier , Mol Microbiol .

NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript The SirA - HilD divergent regulatory cascade could be important to coordinate the events leading to intestinal infection by Salmonella .
Different lines of evidence support the notion that both the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes are required for the production of enteritis in animal models ( Bispham et al. , 2001 ; Santos et al. , 2003 ; Brown et al. , 2005 ; Coburn et al. , 2005 ; Coombes et al. , 2005 ; Hapfelmeier et al. , 2005 ; Jones et al. , 2007 ; Haraga et al. , 2008 ) .
In addition , it was shown that SPI - 2 genes are expressed in the intestine prior to epithelial cell invasion ( Brown et al. , 2005 ) .
Moreover , previous studies indicate that SirA , CsrB/CsrC , CsrA and HilD are required by Salmonella to display phenotypic features involved in intestinal infection ( Jones , 2005 ; Altier , 2005 ; Lucchetti - Miganeh et al. , 2008 ) .
Once Salmonella is inside host cells or growing in N - MM , SPI - 2 genes , which are essential for the systemic phase of the infection ( Cirillo et al. , 1998 ; Hensel et al. , 1998 ; Hansen - Wester and Hensel , 2001 ) , are expressed by a SirA - Csr - HilD - independent mechanism involving other regulators such as OmpR , PhoP and SlyA ( Fass and Groisman , 2009 ) ; whereas expression of the SPI - 1 genes is rapidly downregulated following SPI - 1-mediated invasion or when growing in N - MM ( Eriksson et al. , 2003 ; Drecktrah et al. , 2006 ; Bustamante et al. , 2008 ) .
In this regard , it has also been shown that SPI - 1 is not required for Salmonella replication inside host cells ( Drecktrah et al. , 2006 ) .
These results suggest that the SirA - Csr - HilD regulatory cascade is not functional during the systemic phase of the infection .
Therefore , although SirA has been shown to be required for Salmonella intracellular replication ( Chan et al. , 2005 ) , this does not seem to be related to the SirA - mediated regulation of the SPI - 2 genes intracellularly , but instead of other target genes , in agreement with its global regulatory nature observed in Salmonella and other bacteria ( Ahmer et al. , 1999 , Goodier and Ahmer , 2001 ) .
Our results together with those from other groups , illustrate how multiple global and Salmonella - specific regulators have been integrated to form a complex regulatory circuitry that allow the appropriate spatiotemporal expression of genes that have been acquired by horizontal transfer events .
In addition , they further expand our understanding about the molecular mechanisms coordinating the expression of the SPI - 1 and SPI - 2 genes .

The hilD specific probe was obtained by digesting plasmid pT3 - HilD1 with SalI and BamHI , separation of the fragments on agarose gels and purification of the hilD specific band by using the Qiagen Agarose Purification Kit .
Probe labeling was performed by using [ α - 32 P ] dCTP and the Rediprime II Kit ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Membranes were washed twice with 50 ml of SSC 2X and SDS 0.1 % at 42 ° C , and twice with SSC 0.2 X and SDS 0.1 % at 42 ° C. Images were obtained using the phosphoimager screens and analyzed using the Typhoon image scanner ( Amersham ) .
Determination of the hilD mRNA half - life was performed as previously described ( von Gabain et al. , 1983 ) .

5 ' - end - labeled RNA was treated with RNase T 1 in the presence of the concentration of CsrA shown at the top of each lane .
Partial alkaline hydrolysis ( OH ) and RNase T 1 digestion ( T1 ) ladders , as well as a control lane in the absence of RNase T 1 treatment ( C ) , are shown .
RNase T 1 ladders were generated under denaturing conditions so that every G residue in the transcript could be visualized .
Positions of the CsrA binding sites ( BS ) , Shine - Dalgarno ( SD ) sequence and the translation initiation codon ( Met ) are indicated in the figure and in the hilD sequence at the bottom of figure 9E .
Numbering is with respect to the start of transcription .
( F ) Northern blot analysis of hilD mRNA stability .
WT and ΔcsrA strains were grown in LB to mid - exponential - phase of growth ( OD 600 ~ 0.6 ) , at which time transcription initiation was blocked by the addition of rifampicin .
Samples were harvested at the indicated times , total RNA was prepared , and a 20 µg aliquot from each sample was analyzed by Northern blotting as described in Experimental procedures .
The left panel shows the autoradiogram of the blot with the specific hilD probe , and the ethidium bromide stained rRNA bands , showed as a loading control .
The right panel shows the semi - logarithmic plot of the hilD mRNA decay in the two strains .
