GULIG * Department of Immunology and Medical Microbiology , University of Florida College of Medicine , Gainesville , Florida 32610 - 0266 The 90 - kb virulence plasmid of SalmoneUa typhimurium is necessary for invasion beyond the Peyer 's patches to the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens of orally inoculated mice .
Two TnS insertions located on the left side of a previously identified 14 - kb virulence region ( P. A. Gulig and R. Curtiss m , Infect .
58:3262 - 3271 , 1988 ) and mapping 272 bp from each other exhibited opposite effects on splenic infection of mice after oral inoculation .
spvR23 : : TnS decreased splenic infection by 1,000 - fold , whereas a spv - 14 : : TnS mutant outcompeted wild - type S. typhimurium for splenic infection by 27 - fold in mice fed mixtures of mutated and wild - type S. typhimurium .
spvR23 : : Tn5 was complemented by a virulence plasmid subclone with an insert sequence encoding only an 891 - bp open reading frame specifying a 33,000 - molecular - weight protein .
The amino - acid sequence of this open reading frame had significant homology to members of the LysR family of positive regulatory proteins ; thus , the gene was named spvR ( salmonella plasmid virulence ) .
To examine the possible regulatory effects of spvR on other virulence genes , we constructed a lacZ operon fusion in a downstream virulence gene , spvB .
When spvR subcloned behind the lac promoter was provided on a separate plasmid in trans to the spvB - lacZ operon fusion , transcription of spvB increased 15 - fold .
spv - 14 : : TnS , whih conferred a competitive advantage to S. typhimurium , increased the expression of a spvR - lacZ operon fusion in cis .
spvR is therefore a positive regulator of spvB and an essential virulence gene of S. typhimurium .
As opposed to having spvR subeloned behind the lac promoter , the wild - type spvR gene present on the virulence plasmid did not function to positively regulate spvB - lacZ in trans when salmonellae were grown to the log phase in L broth , suggesting that this regulatory system is activated in - vivo during infection .
Related high - molecular - weight plasmids of several serotypes and species of invasive salmonellae encode essential virulence functions ( reviewed in reference 15 ) .
The 90 - kb virulence plasmid of Salmonella typhimurium is responsible for invasion of salmonellae beyond the Peyer 's patches of the small intestine to the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens of mice after oral inoculation ( 18 , 40 ) .
The specific function ( s ) that the virulence plasmid confers to S. typhimurium to enable invasive infection has not been determined ( 15 ) , although it has been suggested that the virulence plasmid may be involved in immunosuppression ( 23 ) .
Several groups have alluded to functions related to intracellular infection or macrophage resistance as being associated with the virulence plasmid ; however , no direct proof has been published ( 15 , 18 ) .
The large size of the 90 - kb virulence plasmid of S. typhimurium made it desirable to identify smaller specific regions of the plasmid that were involved in conferring virulence .
Gulig and Curtiss used in - vivo selection of virulence - conferring clones of the virulence plasmid to identify sequences associated with virulence in mice ( 19 ) .
S. typhimurium isolates containing virulence - conferring clones were obtained from the spleens of mice fed S. typhimurium containing a library of cloned virulence plasmid sequences .
A 14 - kb region was common to three virulence - conferring cosmid clones .
This consensus virulence region was similar to that found by others ( 1 , 2 , 15 , 25 , 27 , 28 , 34 , 36 , 45 , 55 , 56 ) .
Several genes have been identified in the 14 - kb virulence region that may encode virulence - factors .
DNA sequence analysis has identified six genes running in a head - to - tail * 7176 orientation throughout the virulence region that may specify the following proteins : a 33,000 - molecular weight protein ( 33K ) , 32K , 70K , 28K , 27.5 K , and 13.5 K ( 16 , 17 , 27 , 31 , 32 , 37 - 39 , 44 , 48 - 50 ) .
These genes have recently been renamed as salmonella plasmid virulence ( spv ) genes with the names spvR , spvA , spvB , spvC , spvD , and orfE , respectively ( 20 ) .
Our laboratory designation for these genes was previously vir .
We have adopted the spv system in this paper .
Only one of these genes has been conclusively shown to be a virulence gene through the use of genetic analysis involving mutagenesis and complementation with precisely cloned genes .
virA ( now renamed spvC ) , encoding a 28K protein , was verified as being a virulence gene through complementation of an attenuating Tn5 insertion , vir - 22 : : TnS ( spv - 22 : : TnS ) , with cloned spvC ( 17 ) .
The sixth gene is not necessary for virulence ( 16 , 27 ) .
Recently , Pullinger et al. ( 44 ) identified a gene from S. typhimurium in which the deduced amino - acid sequence specifies a 33K protein with homology to the positive regulatory protein MetR of S. typhimurium ( 42 ) .
The same open reading frame ( ORF ) was subsequently sequenced by Norel et al. ( 38 ) and Taira and Rhen ( 48 ) from their own S. typhimurium strains and by Krause et al. ( 27 ) from Salmonella dublin .
Genetic confirmation of the essential role in virulence of the gene encoding the 33K protein and other genes in the virulence region and , more specifically , their functions remained to be determined .
In this report , we identify a TnS insertion , spvR23 : : TnS , in the S. typhimurium virulence plasmid that decreased splenic infection of mice after oral inoculation .
Sequence analysis revealed that spvR23 : : TnS interrupts an ORF for a 33K protein with identity to those reported by others ( 27 , 38 , 44 , 48 ) that is homologous to MetR .

RESULTS Isolation of Tn5 insertions in the left region of the spv ( vir ) locus .
TnS insertions were produced in the plasmid pYA403 , which contains a 23 - kb insert sequence from the S. typhimurium virulence plasmid and confers wild - type virulence to plasmid - cured S. typhimurium ( 19 ) .
The insertions described in this study were produced with the insertions described previously ( 19 ) .
spv - 2 : : TnS , spv - 14 : : Tn5 , spv - 8 : : TnS , and spv - 23 : : TnS were mapped in the left region of the 14 - kb spv locus ( 19 ) , and their map locations are shown in Fig. 1 .
When the pYA403 : : TnS derivatives were tested for their abilities to confer virulence to plasmid - cured S. typhimurium X3337 as measured by splenic infection after oral inoculation of mice , spv - 23 : : TnS was the only insertion that reduced virulence ( data not shown ) .
The TnS insertions were then transduced into the virulence plasmid of wild - type S. typhimurium X3181 , and the resulting strains were tested for virulence .
During infection of mice with single S. typhimurium strains , again only spv - 23 : : TnS decreased virulence , as shown by a 1,000 - fold decrease in splenic infection of UF006 from wild - type levels ( Table 3 ) .
With the following exception , identical results were obtained when virulence was examined with single and mixed infections of mice .
The spv - 14 : : TnS mutant of S. typhimurium had higher splenic CFU than did wild - type S. typhimurium X3306 after oral inoculation of mice with mixtures of UFOO3 ( spv - 14 : : TnS ) , and wild - type X3306 ( Table 3 ) .
In this mixed infection , the UF003 splenic infection ( 1.5 x 106 CFU ) was no higher than that of wild - type S. typhimurium observed in a single infection ( 2.2 x 106 CFU ) .
However , in the mixed infection , the wild - type X3306 showed a reduced splenic infection ( 4.5 x 104 CFU ) relative to that of wild - type S. typhimurium in a single inoculation .
This indicated that the spv - 14 : : TnS mutant was outcompeting x3306 for splenic infection of mice , resulting in lower CFU of X3306 , as opposed to UF003 exhibiting an absolute increase in the ability to infect spleens .
When mice were inoculated with either UF003 or X3306 separately , each strain achieved equal log splenic CFU ( 5.8 + 0.1 and 5.6 ± 1.0 , respectively ) .
spv - 14 : : TnS and spv - 23 : : TnS mapped within 300 bp of each other as determined by restriction analysis .
This initial mapping was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis ( see below ) .
Since spv - 14 : : TnS and spv - 23 : : TnS affected virulence , we reasoned that these insertions affected a virulence gene ( s ) that was bounded by spv - 2 : : TnS on the left and spv - 8 : : Tn5 on the right , which did not alter virulence .
Isolation of a spv - 23 : : TnS - complementing clone .
To identify plasmids capable of complementing the spv - 23 : : TnS insertion and therefore encoding the mutated gene ( s ) , we used in vivo selection exactly as described previously ( 19 ) .
The same recombinant library consisting of approximately 3 - kb virulence plasmid insert sequences in pACYC184 ( 19 ) was transformed into UF006 and fed to mice .
Plasmid pYA442 was isolated from the spleens of diseased mice and was able to fully complement spv - 23 : : TnS upon transformation into UFOO6 ( data not shown ) .
Most important , pYA442 contained sequences coinciding with the locus mutated by both spv - 14 : : TnS and spv - 23 : : Tn5 .
The insert sequence also extended approximately 1.8 kb to the right of the EcoRI site ( Fig. 1 ) .
Deletion derivatives of pYA442 were constructed to identify the minimal DNA sequence needed to complement spv - 23 : : TnS .
Because spv - 8 : : TnS had no effect on virulence ( Table 3 ) and mapped slightly to the right of the EcoRI site in the insert sequence of pYA442 , we reasoned that plasmid 7180 CALDWELL AND GULIG DNA to the right of spv - 8 : : TnS should not be necessary for complementation of spv - 23 : : Tn5 .
We therefore deleted from pYA442 the sequence between the EcoRI site of the virulence plasmid insert sequence and the HindIII site of pACYC184 .
The resulting plasmid , pGTR059 ( Fig. 1 ) , was transformed into UFOO6 and fully complemented spv - 23 : : TnS ( Table 3 ) .
pGTRO59 still contained sequences that corresponded to the insertion sites of spv - 14 : : TnS and spv - 23 : : TnS .
Because spv - 23 : : TnS mapped to the right of a BstEII site in pGTR059 , we deleted from pGTR059 sequences between the BstEII site of the virulence plasmid insert and the Sail site of pACYC184 .
The deleted sequence encoded the region corresponding to the spv - 14 : : Tn5 insertion sequence .
The resulting plasmid , pGTR069 , still encoded the sequence that corresponded to the insertion site of spv - 23 : : TnS ( Fig. 1 ) .
pGTRO69 fully complemented virulence for spv - 23 : : TnS of UFOO6 ( Table 3 ) .
pGTRO69 alone was unable to confer virulence to virulence - plasmid cured S. typhimurium X3337 ( Table 3 ) .
Thus , pGTRO69 with an insert size of 1.2 kb was sufficient to complement spv - 23 : : Tn5 and encoded the mutated gene ( s ) .
DNA sequence analysis of spvR .
We sequenced the region of the virulence plasmid extending from outside the left boundary of the 14 - kb consensus virulence region ( 19 ) on the left to spv - 8 : : TnS on the right ( Fig. 2 ) .
The left boundary of the 14 - kb virulence region , as defined by the left end of the insert sequence of the virulence - conferring cosmid clone pYA401 ( 19 ) , was located at the GATC Sau3AI site at bp 139 .
Our DNA sequence was nearly identical to those obtained by Pullinger et al. ( 44 ) , Norel et al. ( 38 ) , Taira and Rhen ( 48 ) , and Krause et al. ( 27 ) .
We identified an ORF consisting of 891 bp extending from 416 bp right of spv - 2 : : TnS toward the EcoRI site .
There were no differences between our DNA sequence of the ORF and the sequences of the others ( 38 , 44 , 48 ) , except as detailed below for Krause et al. ( 27 ) .
In the noncoding sequence , Pullinger et al. ( 44 ) have a T and G inserted after our bp 1654 and 1656 , respectively .
Norel et al. ( 38 ) have deletions of 1 of our 10 A 's between bp 652 and 661 and our G at bp 1754 .
Our sequence differed from the corresponding S. dublin sequence of Krause et al. ( 27 ) in the following ways .
Within the ORF our A at base 792 is a G resulting in an Asp - to - Gly amino - acid alteration ; whereas our G at base 981 is an A resulting in a Gly - to - Glu amino - acid alteration .
In the upstream noncoding sequence Krause et al. have a deletion of two A residues immediately 5 ' to the putative ribosome binding site ( bases 652 through 661 ) ; our T at base 130 is a C , and our C at base 597 is an A. spv - 23 : : TnS interrupted this ORF , as did TnJO insertion M242 described by Pullinger et al. ( 44 ) , Tn5 zzx - 2558 described by Taira and Rhen ( 48 ) , and Tn5 - oriT 15 - 2 of Beninger et al. ( 2 ) .
Our sequence included a consensus ribosome - binding site 6 bp upstream of the putative start codon and consensus promoter -10 and -35 regions 23 and 47 bp , respectively , upstream of the start codon .
spv - 14 : : TnS was located 163 bp upstream of the start codon and 110 bp upstream of the putative -35 region .
The BstEII site used for subcloning the spv - 23 : : TnS - complementing region was located outside of the -35 region and 3 ' to spv - 14 : : TnS .
Thus , pGTRO69 , which complemented spv - 23 : : TnS , encoded the entire ORF but no other ORFs .
Our amino - acid sequence was compared with the Genbank data base by using the TFASTA program ( 30 , 41 ) and exhibited homology to MetR ( 42 ) ( Fig. 3 ) , as did the deduced amino - acid sequences of others ( 27 , 44 ) .

Amino acid sequence alignment of SpvR with S. typhimurium MetR ( 42 ) .
Sequences were aligned by using the Gap program .
Vertical lines indicate identity , colons indicate high similarity , and periods indicate low similarity between aligned amino acid residues .
encoding the ORF and mutated by spv - 23 : : TnS was named spvR ( 20 ) .
spv - 23 : : TnS is henceforth called spvR23 : : TnS .
SpvR also showed significant homology to other members of the LysR family of positive regulatory proteins ( 22 ) .
Among the most homologous were LysR ( 47 ) and IlvY ( 54 ) .
SpvR is a positive regulator of other virulence plasmid genes .
The homology of SpvR to MetR of the LysR family of positive regulatory proteins suggested that spvR encodes a positive regulatory protein for other plasmid - encoded virulence factors .
To examine this possibility , we measured the effects of cloned spvR in trans on lacZ operon fusions in other cloned virulence plasmid genes .
A promoterless lacZ gene was inserted into spvB at a unique KpnI site in the plasmid pGTR101 ( Fig. 1 ) .
The plasmid pGTR101 consists of the 4 - kb EcoRI fragment of the 14 - kb virulence region ( 19 ) subcloned into the EcoRI site of pACYC184 .
pGTR101 encodes three virulence genes , spvA , spvB , and spvC , which are oriented in a head - to - tail manner with the pACYC184 cat gene in the opposite orientation at the 3 ' end of spvC ( 16 ) .
In this construct no vector promoter functions are present to affect expression of spvA , spvB , or spvC .
pGTR101 containing the spvB - lacZ fusion was named pGTR077 .
Since pGTRO77 was constructed in pACYC184 , we could not use pGTRO59 or pGTRO69 ( also constructed in pACYC184 ) to supply spvR in trans .
Therefore , pGTRO79 , which contained the spvR gene subcloned behind the lac promoter of the low - copy - number vector pYA2204 , was used to supply spvR in trans .
pGTRO79 or pYA2204 was transformed into X3337 ( pGTR077 ) .
The presence of spvR on pGTRO79 increased by 15 - fold the transcription of the spvBlacZ operon fusion relative to the transcription after the addition of the vector alone or no additional plasmid ( Fig. 4 ) .
To verify that the increase in transcription of spvB was a result of expression of spvR , we repressed the expression of spvR from the lac promoter by transforming into X3337 ( pGTR077 , pGTRO79 ) a compatible lacd subclone , pGTR255 .
pGTR255 consists of the lacIq gene from pJW701 ( 59 ) cloned into a derivative , pGTR253 , of the temperaturesensitive replicon pHSG422 ( 21 ) .
At 30 °C , pGTR255 is maintained and produces the Lacd repressor ( 13 ) .

Increased expression of spvB - lacZ by spvR provided in trans .
S. typhimurium X3337 was transformed with the indicated plasmids and grown to the midlog phase , and the P - galactosidase activity from 4 spvB - lacZ operon fusion of pGTR077 was determined by the method of Miller ( 35 ) .
The standard devjitions of triplicate samples were less than 10 % of the mean except for those of pYA2204 ( standard deviation , 50 % ) and pGTR253 ( standard deviation , 100 % ) .
expression did not decrease down to the levels X3337 ( pGTRO77 ) alone , i.e. , with no spvR present ( Fig. 4 ) .
Interestingly , X3337 ( pGTRO77 , pGTRO79 , pGTR253 ) exhibited a decrease in the expression of spvB - lacZ in comparison to X3337 ( pGTRO77 , pGTRO79 ) .
However , the decrease was not as great as that seen with pGTR255 containing lacIq .
The decrease in expression caused by pGTR253 may have been caused by the presence of three plasmid species resulting in decreased copy number of pGTRO77 .
However , it is clear that the presence of spvR in trans increased the transcription of another virulence plasmid - encoded gene , spvB .
The role of SpvR as a positive regulator of other virulence plasmidencoded genes that had been hypothesized from amino - acid sequence homology has now been substantiated genetically .
Similar results have been obtained with lacZ operon fusions in spvA and spvC of pGTR101 ( 58 ) .
Thus , SpvR is a positive regulator of at least three essential virulence genes .
spv - 14 : : TnS increases expression of spvR .
spv - 14 : : TnS , which is located 163 bp 5 ' to the start codon of spvR , enabled UFOO3 to outcompete wild - type S. typhimurium X3306 for splenic infection of mice inoculated with mixtures of wildtype and mutant strains ( Table 3 ) .
Because spvR encodes a positive regulatory element , we hypothesized that UFOO3 outcompeted wild - type S. typhimurium for splenic infection by increasing the expression of spvR .
To test this hypothesis , we transduced spv - 14 : : TnS into pGTRO72 and pGTRO75 containing lacZ inserted into spvR in both orientations , resulting in pGTRO97 and pGTRO98 , respectively ( Fig. 1 ) .
spv - 14 : : TnS increased the production of spvR - lacZ in pGTRO97 from 38 to 72 U ( 1.9 - fold ) , but resulted in little change , if any , in the expression of lacZ in the control plasnmid , pGTRO98 , in which lacZ is downstream of the tet promoter ( Fig. 5 ) .
Although the pathogenic mechanism by 0.1 co C. ) cm cc seen with c ' J Qa s QR Plasmids in X3337 spv - 14 : : TnS increases transcription of an spvR - 1acZ op - FIG. 5 .
S. typhimurium X3337 was transformed with the indicated plasmids , and the 0 - galactosidase activities of triplicate samples were determined .
The standard deviations were less than 10 % of the mean for every sample .
which UFOO3 outcompetes wild - type S. typhimurium by splenic infection of mice is not completely understood , it is clear that spv - 14 : : TnS increases the expression of spvR .
Additional copies of spvR increase virulence of S. typhimurium .
spv - 14 : : TnS increased splenic infection of mice 27 - fold compared with wild - type S. typhimurium x3306 ( Table 3 ) , and spv - 14 : : TnS increased the expression of spvR ( Fig. 5 ) , suggesting that increased expression of spvR would result in increased virulence .
To test this hypothesis , we examined the effects on virulence of adding cloned spvR present on pGTRO69 to wild - type S. typhimurium .
X3181 ( pGTR069 ) achieved 18 - fold higher levels of splenic infection than did wild - type S. typhimurium X3306 in mixed infections of mice ( Table 3 ) .
This increase in splenic infection by pGTRO69 was similar to that seen with spv - 14 : : TnS ( Table 3 ) .
The vector of pGTRO69 , pACYC184 , did not increase splenic infection of X3181 .
Mice that were inoculated with X3181 ( pGTRO69 ) alone had log splenic CFU values that were equal to those after infection with wild - type S. typhimurium alone ( 5.9 0.3 and 5.7 ± 1.5 , respectively ) .
This result was also similar to that seen with single infections of the spv - 14 : : TnS mutant of S. typhimurium .
That additional copies of spvR increased the virulence of S. typhimurium and that spv - 14 : : TnS increased the expression of spvR are consistent with the hypothesis that spv - 14 : : TnS increased virulence through increased expression of spvR .
SpvR does not function to stimulate expression of spvB in S. typhimurium growing in L broth .
Having demonstrated that cloned spvR can act in trans to increase the expression of cloned spvB , we examined the effects in trans of mutations of spvR in the virulence plasmid on cloned spvB - lacZ fusions .
pGTRO77 was transformed into plasmid - cured S. typhimurium X3337 , wild - type S. typhimurium X3181 , UFOO2 ( spv - 2 : : TnS ) , UFOO3 ( spv - 14 : : TnS ) , and UFOO6 ( spvR23 : : Tn5 ) .
Expression of spvB - lacZ was then measured as , - galactosidase activity of S. typhimurium cultures in the log phase .
As described above , detectable levels of P - galactosidase were observed in X3337 ( pGTRO77 ) containing no other plasmid ( Fig. 6 ) , indicating that spvB does not absolutely require SpvR for basal expression .
Interestingly , the presence of wild - type spvR in X3181 did not affect the expression o TL a - cL 7182 CALDWELL AND GULIG X0 ) co 0 100 - 140 - 120 - 80 - 60 - 40 - 202 C ' ) C ' ) C ' ) ?
S. typhimurium strains with pGTRO77 FIG. 6 .
Effects on transcription of spvR alleles present on the virulence plasmid in trans to an spvB - lacZ operon fusion on pGTRO77 .
S. typhimurium containing either no ( X3337 ) , wild - type ( X3181 ) , control Tn5 ( UF002 ) , constitutive spvR TnS ( UF003 ) , or Spv - Tn5 ( UFO06 ) virulence plasmid genotypes were transformed with pGTRO77 .
The transcriptional activities of the spvB - lacZ operon fusions were measured in salmonellae grown in L broth .
The standard deviations were less than 12 % of the mean for every sample .
of spvB from pGTR077 , nor did spvR23 : : Tn5 ( SpvR - ) and spv - 2 : : TnS ( SpvR + ) .
Only spv - 14 : : Tn5 , which increased the expression of spvR ( Fig. 5 ) , increased the expression of spvB by 4.2 - fold from 32 to 136 U of activity ( Fig. 6 ) .
Because the basal expression of spvB - lacZ was not affected by either wild - type spvR or spvR23 : : Tn5 in trans , we hypothesized that wild - type spvR of the virulence plasmid was not sufficiently expressed by S. typhimurium growing in L broth in these experiments to affect the expression of SpvR - regulated genes in trans .
In the spv - 14 : : Tn5 virulence plasmid background , spvR should be constitutively expressed and in turn should function to positively regulate the expression of spvB .
DISCUSSION We have identified the spvR gene located in the left side of the 14 - kb virulence region ( 19 ) as both an essential virulence gene and a positive regulatory element for other virulence plasmid genes .
This was accomplished primarily through analysis of two TnS insertions that were located 272 bp from each other and that exhibited opposite effects on virulence in infection of mice .
spvR23 : : Tn5 decreased splenic infection after oral inoculation by 1,000 - fold , whereas UFOO3 ( spv - 14 : : Tn5 ) outcompeted wild - type S. typhimurium for splenic infection 27 - fold ( Table 3 ) .
To identify the gene ( s ) mutated by spvR23 : : Tn5 , we isolated plasmids capable of complementing spvR23 : : Tn5 by selecting in - vivo for complementation .
A deletion derivative , pGTRO69 , that contained an insert sequence of 1.2 kb extending from a BstEII site to an EcoRI site fully complemented spvR23 : : TnS ( Table 3 ) and encoded only spvR ( Fig. 2 ) .
The DNA sequence of the left end of the virulence region examined in these studies , including the insert of pGTRO69 , encoded a single ORF of 891 bp that was interrupted by the spvR23 : : Tn5 insertion ( Fig. 2 ) .
The 33K protein encoded by this ORF is therefore a virulence factor , as shown through 49 CM CL 0 U - Z ) 136 C ' ) o o L - CD LL J. BACTERIOL .
combined mutation and precise complementation analyses .
Our DNA sequence of the ORF is identical to sequences published by Pullinger et al. ( 44 ) , Norel et al. ( 38 ) , and Taira and Rhen ( 48 ) .
Our sequence differed from that of Krause et al. ( 27 ) by two base substitutions resulting in amino - acid changes .
As Pullinger et al. originally noted , the amino - acid sequence possesses significant homology to the MetR protein of S. typhimurium , a positive regulatory protein ( 42 ) ( Fig. 3 ) .
The significant homology of MetR with the deduced 33K protein interrupted by spvR23 : : Tn5 resulted in naming the gene spvR ( 20 ) .
The amino - acid homology of SpvR to MetR was suggestive , but not proof , of a regulatory role for SpvR .
Our genetic results demonstrated that spvR placed in trans to a clone encoding a spvB - lacZ fusion can increase the expression of spvB ( Fig. 4 ) .
SpvR was provided from pGTR079 in which spvR was cloned behind the lac promoter .
This plasmid enabled us to verify the stimulatory effect of spvR on spvB expression by experimental repression of the lac promoter of pGTR079 .
The addition of pGTR255 , which encodes the lac repressor , resulted in decreased expression of spvB , but expression remained higher than levels seen with the spvBlacZ fusion plasmid alone ( i.e. , in the absence of spvR ) .
This was not a surprising result , because the spvR insert of pGTR079 contains a putative promoter that should continue to function while the lac promoter is repressed .
The spvR promoter appears to be functional because pGTR072 , which encodes spvR - lacZ operon fusions with no upstream vectorencoded promoters , has low but detectable levels of expression of spvR ( Fig. 5 ) .
These results provided evidence that SpvR can act as a positive regulator of other virulence genes .
We have obtained similar results with lacZ operon fusions in the other two virulence genes of pGTR101 , spvA and spvC ( 58 ) .
MetR is a DNA binding protein that binds the promoters of metE and metH to positively regulate transcription ( 33 ) of parts of the methionine operon through modulation by homocystine ( 5 , 7 , 52 ) .
MetR not only positively regulates other genes but also functions as an autorepressor of its own transcription ( 33 ) .
metR and metE are located side by side but are oriented divergently so that the transcription of the two genes proceeds in opposite directions ( 42 ) .
The promoter regions of metR and metE are nearly superimposed , and MetR binds at a single location that includes the regulatory site for both metR and metE ( 6 , 33 , 42 ) .
When MetR binds at this site , transcription of metE increases while transcription of metR decreases ( 6 , 51 ) .
MetR also binds to the promoter of metH located 3 ' to the metE gene ( 6 ) and glyA ( 43 ) to regulate transcription .
These characteristics of MetR , including its functions as a positive regulatory protein and as an autorepressor , are also characteristics of other proteins of the same family of proteins as MetR , known as the LysR family of positive regulatory proteins ( 22 ) .
We therefore examined whether SpvR regulated a divergently transcribed gene .
The only ORF upstream of spvR in either orientation is an ORF in an IS630 - like element described by Krause et al. ( 26 ) from the S. dublin plasmid .
This ORF is 608 bp from the spvR start codon , and our DNA sequence confirms the first 63 bp of the gene .
Therefore , spvR probably does not regulate a divergently transcribed gene .
spvA , spvB , and spvC , which are regulated by SpvR , are located downstream of spvR , and all of these genes are transcribed in the same direction .
We are examining possible autoregulatory effects of spvR .
SpvR does show homology with the amino - acid sequences of LysR family members at the critical conserved residues VOL .
173 , 1991 REGULATION OF S. TYPHIMURIUM VIRULENCE PLASMID GENE 7183 ( Fig. 3 ) in the amino - terminal end .
This amino - terminal region of the protein is believed to encode a helix - turn - helix domain possibly involved in DNA binding ( 22 ) .
A confirmation of structure - function domains must await further analysis of both the spvR gene and the SpvR protein .
Several procedures including minicell , maxicell , and in vitro transcription - translation expression systems were utilized in an effort to identify the protein product of spvR .
No product was detected from spvR in any of the presently described plasmids tested , possibly because of the presence of vector - encoded peptides ( data not shown ) .
However , we recently subcloned spvR by fusing the start codon with that of lacZ driven by the trc promoter , and we were able to identify the SpvR protein in Coomassie blue - stained gels of whole bacterial protein ( data not shown ) .
Other reports concerning the S. typhimurium spvR homologs did not include a figure demonstrating the expected 33K protein , although Pullinger et al. ( 44 ) were able to identify the protein product .
Williamson et al. showed the expression of a 33K protein from a homologous region of the S. dublin virulence plasmid ( 57 ) .
Similarly , Kawahara et al. ( 25 ) reported the expression of a 32K protein in minicells from the mba region of the virulence plasmid of S. choleraesuis that mapped within the homologous region of the virulence plasmid of S. typhimurium .
spv - 14 : : TnS located 163 bp 5 ' to the spvR start codon enabled mutant salmoneilae to outcompete wild - type S. typhimurium for splenic infection when mice were inoculated with both wild - type and spv - 14 : : TnS mutant S. typhimurium ( Table 3 ) .
spv - 14 : : TnS increased the expression of spvR ( Fig. 5 ) .
Because spvR encodes an activator of other virulence genes , constitutive production of SpvR would increase expression of other virulence genes under control of spvR .
Consistent with this hypothesis , providing additional copies of spvR in trans to the wild - type virulence plasmid also enabled outcompetition against wild - type S. typhimurium for splenic infection of mice ( Table 3 ) .
It appears that in salmonellae growing in the log phase in L broth , spvR of the wild - type virulence plasmid is not expressed at levels great enough to increase in trans expression of the spvB - lacZ fusion of pGTRO77 .
When pGTRO77 encoding a spvB - lacZ fusion was placed in trans to the wild - type virulence plasmid , a virulence plasmid with mutated spvR , or a virulence plasmid mutated with a nonattenuating TnS insertion , no differences in expression of spvB were seen relative to that with spvB - lacZ in a virulence plasmid - free strain ( Fig. 6 ) .
spvB - lacZ of pGTRO77 was capable of responding to increased expression of spvR from the virulence plasmid , because when pGTRO77 was placed in trans to the spv - 14 : : TnS mutated virulence plasmid , in which expression of spvR should be increased , expression of spvB increased .
We recently determined that the SpvR - mediated regulation of downstream genes is activated in S. typhimurium at the stationary - phase in L broth ( data not shown ) .
Whether the virulence genes spvA , spvB , and spvC are affected by spvR in cis when S. typhimurium is growing in L broth will not be known until lacZ - fusions in these genes have been recombined into the virulence plasmid .
Although spv - 14 : : TnS enabled S. typhimurium UFOO3 to outcompete a wild - type strain in a mixed infection ( Table 3 ) , UFOO3 and the wild - type strain resulted in equal levels of splenic infection when mice were infected with either strain individually .
This suggested that UFOO3 was not inherently more virulent but rather was able to compete better than wild - type salmonellae at a step of infection required for invasion beyond the Peyer 's patches to the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen .
Because spvR does not appear to be functioning during - growth in L broth to stimulate expression of effector genes , UFOO3 may be primed for more efficient infection through the constitutive expression of spvR and SpvR - regulated genes .
This could explain why the spv - 14 : : Tn5 mutant outcompetes the wild - type strain but does not achieve higher levels of splenic infection during infection with single strains .
Clearly , many questions remain to be answered about the role of spvR in plasmid - mediated virulence of S. typhimurium and regulation of other virulence genes .
What are the mechanism and site of action of SpvR , and how is spvR itself regulated ?
In summary , we have identified the spvR gene of the S. typhimurium virulence plasmid as a virulence factor of S. typhimurium that acts as a positive regulator of transcription for other plasmid - encoded virulence genes of S. typhimurium .
It appears that S. typhimurium growing in L broth in vitro does not express spvR at levels great enough for it to act as a positive regulator of other virulence genes .
This regulatory system may therefore be induced in - vivo during infection of mice .
