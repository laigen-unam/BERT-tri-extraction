D. Hinton 1 , * 1 Department of Microbiology , School of Genetics and Microbiology , Moyne Institute of Preventive Medicine , Trinity College Dublin ; Dublin , Ireland REVIEW The combination of genomics and high - throughput cDNA sequencing technologies has facilitated the identification of many small RNAs ( sRNAs ) that play a central role in the posttranscriptional gene regulation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium .
To date , most of the functionally characterized sRNAs have been involved in the regulation of processes which are not directly linked to virulence .
Just five sRNAs have been found to affect the ability of Salmonella to replicate within mammalian cells , but the precise regulatory mechanisms that are used by sRNAs to control Salmonella pathogenicity at the post - transcriptional level remain to be identified .
It is anticipated that an improved understanding of sRNA biology will shed new light on the virulence of Salmonella .
Introduction Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) is a well - characterized enteropathogen which causes both gastroenteritis and serious systemic infections .
In humans , salmonellosis is mainly contracted by the ingestion of contaminated food or water .
The annual cost of Salmonella infection in the US is estimated to be US$ 3 billion .
1 Thus , Salmonella continues to have a big impact upon human life , and the control of this bacterium remains a significant challenge for the food industry .
The fact that Salmonella bacteria have been found in a number of different sites in the body during infection and at different stages of food processing reflects the ability of the microbes to thrive in many environmental conditions .
Salmonella can sense its environment and rapidly adapt to changing conditions , a process which is mediated by regulation at the transcriptional , post - transcriptional and translational levels .
The key players involved in this adaptation process are transcription factors and nucleoid - associated proteins , as well as the more recently identified regulatory small RNAs ( sRNAs ) .
Though the first evidence for the existence of bacterial sRNAs was reported in 1967 , 2 most of the discoveries of bacterial sRNAs have only occurred in the last decade .

3 - 6 The strategy for finding sRNAs involved bioinformatic screens that were validated by experimental approaches using transcriptomic tools such as tiling microarrays and high - throughput cDNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) .
7 To date , hundreds of sRNAs have been identified in bacteria , but roles in virulence have only been elucidated for a minority .
RNAIII of Staphylococcus aureus was the first regulatory sRNA shown to be involved in bacterial pathogenicity by targeting at least five mRNAs that encode virulence - factors .
8 - 10 Other examples of virulence - associated sRNAs have been described in a recent review .
11 Here we survey the sRNAs identified in S. Typhimurium to date and discuss our current understanding of the role of sRNAs in the control of virulence .
We then focus on the regulation of these sRNAs and their target mRNAs .
Small RNAs in bacteria .
sRNAs are stable and abundant transcripts of about 50 -- 500 nucleotides in length which are usually non - coding and exhibit a regulatory function .
Posttranscriptional gene regulation by sRNAs may occur in different ways by base - pairing interaction with a target RNA resulting in different outcomes or by directly binding to proteins to modulate their function .
12 - 14 Two distinct classes of sRNAs have been identified : trans - encoded RNAs which are transcribed from intergenic regions of the genome , and cis - encoded RNAs which are encoded on the strand complementary to coding sequences or the 5 ' or 3 ' untranslated region ( 5 ' UTR , 3 ' UTR ) of transcripts .
15 - 17 The family of trans - encoded sRNAs usually requires the chaperone Hfq to stabilize the often imperfect base - pairing interaction with target mRNA .
18 In contrast , cisencoded sRNAs possess a region of perfect complementarity to their target mRNA and Hfq is not needed for target binding .
It is now clear that sRNAs are involved in many key physiological processes including anaerobic - growth , nutrient availability , iron homeostasis and the response to oxidative , envelope and osmotic stress .
9,19 - 23 Insights from sRNA research in Salmonella .
Much of the initial investigation of riboregulation by sRNAs involved nonpathogenic E. coli strains as a model .
The more recent use of Salmonella as a model organism allows us to ask new questions about sRNAs involved in virulence in a variety of infection models , in the context of a well - established array of genetic tools .
Next to E. coli , Salmonella is now the best - characterized model of sRNA - mediated regulation in Gram - negative bacteria .

24,25 These studies expand our view on the biological significance of sRNAs , establishing them as global gene regulators .
Key mechanistic findings from studies in Salmonella have advanced our basic understanding of sRNA - mediated regulation in bacteria .
The distinct modular structure of sRNAs , including the highly conserved target binding region ( also referred as to the `` seed '' region ) , was demonstrated for the σ E - dependent sRNA RybB in Salmonella .
Fusion of this seed region to an unrelated sRNA backbone permitted full repression of the RybB regulon .
26 - 28 Current techniques for the discovery of sRNA targets .
To complement the identification of new sRNAs , several methods allowing the discovery of sRNAs targets have been developed in Gram - negative bacteria .
For trans - encoded sRNAs , the basepairing interaction with mRNAs is imperfect and often requires Hfq .
One example is the Hfq - associated sRNA MicC sRNA which silences S. Typhimurium ompD mRNA and only requires a ⩽ 12 - bp RNA duplex within the CDS ( codons 23 -- 26 ) for repression .
29 Different bioinformatic tools allow the prediction of the binding regions of sRNA and mRNA by combining comparative genomics with a search for certain physical parameters .
TargetRNA calculates optimal hybridization scores between an sRNA and all mRNAs in the genome .
30 IntaRNA is a method for the prediction of interactions between two RNAs based on minimization of an extended hybridization energy .
31 Although most of these software tools can confirm previously known findings , they should be considered as predictive tools that often produce false - positive results and require experimental validation .
As the interaction of cis - encoded sRNAs involves a perfect match , the identification of their targets is more straightforward .
IsrA is a cis - encoded RNA present on the complementary strand to the STM0294 .1 gene , which encodes a protein with no clear functional annotation .
Padalon - Brauch et al. have shown that IsrA is expressed during exponential phase , osmotic - stress , peroxide stress and cold - shock , and downregulated during stationary phase ( Fig. 2 ) .
The expression of STM0294 .1 shows the opposite pattern to that of IsrA , and so it has been suggested that IsrA could regulate transcription of STM0294 .1 .
32 Pulse - expression of sRNAs has been developed as an efficient method to identify mRNA targets , because classical genetic approaches often result in quite subtle phenotypes for sRNA mutants .
33,34 The technique involves the rapid overproduction of an sRNA followed by the use of a microarray to identify bacterial transcripts that were bound by the sRNA and subsequently degraded by an RNaseE - dependent mechanism .
33 This approach has been used to elucidate large regulons of as many as 50 genes controlled by a single sRNA ( Fig. 1 ) .
The regulatory interaction between sRNAs and candidate mRNA targets must be confirmed within living bacterial cells , and can be done with a GFP - based two - plasmid reporter system .
The ablation of GFP fluorescence by expression of the sRNA confirms the direct effect of an sRNA upon its mRNA target .

32 Cultures of S. Typhimurium were grown under different conditions ( described from left - hand side ) : Cells grown in LB to an OD 600 of 0.3 , 1 and 4.5 ; Oxygen limitation -- overnight growth without agitation in 50 mL Falcon tubes to an OD 600 of 0.9 ; Osmotic stress -- cells grown in LB containing elevated ( 0.5 M ) NaCl levels for 30 min ; Oxidative stress using 0.2 mM paraquat ( PQ ) and 1 mM hydrogen - peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) ; Iron limiting conditions -- addition of 0.2 mM 2,2 ' dipyridyl ; pH stress -- LB at pH 4.9 ( adjusted with HCl ) and LBK media at pH 8.4 ; N min low Mg and N min high Mg -- N minimal media with 10 µM MgCl 2 ( low magnesium ) and 10 mM MgCl 2 ( high magnesium ) ; Cold shock at 15 °C and heat - shock at 42 °C ; Intra - macrophage 1h and 8h -- within activated J774.A1 macrophage cells assayed using gentamycin protection assay ; 32 In vitro conditions resembling the gastrointestinal tract .
57 This is measured accurately by flow cytometry , on agar plates or by determining the GFP protein levels by western blotting .
35 The attribution of the role of a particular sRNA can be complicated by functional redundancy as it is well known that several sRNAs can silence the same target mRNA .
For example , MicC , RybB , InvR and SdsR all negatively regulate the ompD gene ( Fig. 1 ) .
26,29,36,37 In this case , the effect of deleting one sRNA could be masked by the action of the remaining three sRNAs , and it may be necessary to delete all the sRNAs regulating a particular pathway to observe a clear phenotype .
Another example of functional redundancy is the Csr system which modulates carbon metabolism and also regulates SPI1 and SPI2 expression through HilD .
38 It comprises two sRNAs , CsrB and CsrC and the RNA chaperone CsrA .
39,40 Although the single mutants ΔcsrB or ΔcsrC are not impaired in their ability to infect epithelial cells , a ΔcsrB ΔcsrC mutant shows a significant invasion defect .
While complementation with either CsrB or CsrC leads only to partial restoration of wild - type levels of invasion , the presence of both www.landesbioscience.com RNA Biology 439 Table 1A .

Conservation of small RNAs between Salmonella and E. coli .
The last decade witnessed increasing numbers of sRNAs being discovered in E. coli and Argaman et al. reported that about 24 sRNAs were conserved between Salmonella and E. coli .
3,41 This important finding prompted the use of conservation analysis to discover new sRNAs in E. coli .

Approximately 400 sRNAs have now been predicted in about 70 microbial genomes , including those of the Escherichia , Shigella and Salmonella genera , 42 and comparative analyses of the genomes of different Salmonella serovars and E. coli have shown the levels of sRNA conservation .
Recent studies have reported similar levels ( 48 -- 67 % ) of conservation among Salmonella and E. coli species .
43,44 The large number of non - conserved small RNAs suggests that species - specific sRNAs could have specialized roles in pathogenicity .
However , even highly conserved sRNAs were shown to regulate species - specific virulence - factors as demonstrated by Papenfort et al. 45 In this study , the Salmonella - specific effector protein SopD was shown to be regulated by the ancestral Do not distribute .
sRNA SgrS , which is found in both pathogenic and non - pathogenic species .
Expression profiles of S. Typhimurium sRNAs and their role during infection .
S. Typhimurium and E. coli diverged from a common ancestor about 100 -- 130 million years ago and share about 71 % of their genetic information .
46 - 48 S. Typhimurium possesses a unique set of attributes that allow it to survive in the hostile environments associated with each stage of animal infection , and to colonize different intracellular niches within mammalian cells .
For instance , once ingested , this bacterium must first cope with an increase in temperature followed by the acidic environment of the stomach .
In the intestine , the microorganism is subjected to increased osmolarity , a decrease in oxygen tension , bile and competition with the intestinal microbiota .
49 Salmonella can subsequently enter and proliferate within non - phagocytic and phagocytic cells , where the pathogen resists intracellular defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial peptides , the acidification of the Salmonella - containing vacuole ( SCV ) and the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species .
In response to these stressful conditions , S. Typhimurium must quickly modulate its transcriptional profile , raising the possibility that the rapid gene regulation mediated by sRNAs would be particularly relevant .
50 Monitoring sRNA expression could reveal patterns of induction relevant to the strategies used by Salmonella to survive within host cells .
An sRNA involved in Salmonella virulence was first reported in the year 2000 .
51 Deletion of the bi - functional transfer - mRNA ( tmRNA ) , which rescues ribosomes stalled on defective mRNAs ( reviewed in ref .
52 ) , resulted in an avirulent Salmonella mutant in mouse infections .
Binding of tmRNA to stalled ribosomes requires the small protein SmpB which has been shown to be important for proliferation of Salmonella in macrophages .
53,54 In an attempt to find S. Typhimurium specific sRNAs that had not already been characterized in E. coli , the Altuvia lab used a computational approach to identify and validate 19 new sRNAs located in intergenic regions of the Salmonella pathogenicity islands ( SPIs ) .
32 The sRNA expression was monitored by northern blot analysis both in media mimicking infection - relevant stress conditions and directly inside macrophages .
Many of the islandencoded sRNAs were induced in conditions including stationary phase growth , in minimal - medium , upon temperature shock , acidity and oxidative - stress ( Fig. 2 ) .
In macrophages , expression of IsrC and IsrN was induced early during infection and then decreased as the infection progressed , similar to the results shown earlier for OxyS in E. coli .
20,55 Conversely , IsrE ( RyhB2 ) , RyhB1 and IsrH showed increased levels of expression later during infection .
The differential expression patterns suggest a role for sRNAs at different stages of infection .
In contrast , IsrH has recently been shown to be downregulated during infection of fibroblasts , in which wild - type Salmonella is non - replicative .
56 Two of the island - encoded sRNAs , IsrJ and IsrM , were found to be particularly important for Salmonella proliferation within non - phagocytic cells and/or macrophages .
32,57 IsrJ is upregulated under conditions which promote invasion of epithelial cells and is positively regulated by HilA , the central transcriptional activator of SPI1 .
The deletion of isrJ results in a less invasive mutant strain that is impaired for translocation of the effector protein SptP , which is required for remodelling the host cell cytoskeleton after bacterial entry .
32,58 The ΔisrM mutant showed a broad virulence defect , with reduced invasion of epithelial cells , lower intracellular replication/survival in macrophages , and reduced growth in the ileum and spleen of mice .
57 IsrM post - transcriptionally represses the expression of virulence - factors hilE and sopA .
Most SPI1 genes are negatively regulated by HilE through sequestration of HilD , the major transcriptional activator of SPI1 , while SopA is a secreted effector protein that is involved in causing inflammation and diarrhea .
59,60 IsrM therefore aids in choreographing the expression of virulence - factors .

PhoQ , the kinase in the PhoPQ two component regulatory sys - Another study to identify sRNAs required for S. Typhimurium In E. coli , the translation of RpoS is repressed by OxyS 68 virulence focused on 37 sRNAs that are conserved in both E. coli and the sigma factor is positively regulated by 3 Hfq - dependent and S. Typhimurium .
Single small RNA deletion mutants were sRNAs , namely DsrA , ArcZ and RprA , which act by relieving the tested by competitive index in the murine infection model .
A inhibitory secondary structure that prevents rpoS translation .
71 - 73 key finding of this study was that 34 of the tested 37 sRNAs did This type of regulation is conserved , but is less pronounced in not play a role in Salmonella virulence ( Table 1A ) .
61 Only two Salmonella , questioning the significance of DsrA , ArcZ and sRNA mutants , ΔsroA and ΔistR gave a reproducible attenuated RprA for Salmonella virulence .
74,75 Further study of the function phenotype in mice , with a reduced ability to compete with the of the RpoS sigma factor in S. Typhimurium is required , and may wild - type strain ( Table 1B ) .
The IstR sRNA , which was originally identified in E. coli by the Altuvia lab in 2004 , inhibits the Hfq as a mediator of sRNA regulation .
The Hfq protein is a lead to the identification of more links with sRNA biology .
synthesis of an SOS - induced toxic peptide .
62 The SroA RNA is key player in the global post - transcriptional regulatory network assumed to result from attenuated transcription of a riboswitch that facilitates the interactions of Salmonella sRNAs with target element of the thiBPQ mRNA that codes for proteins involved mRNAs .
18 Deletion of hfq in Salmonella gives rise to a non - motile in thiamine uptake , 63,64 but its function remains unclear .
In contrast , one strain lacking the OxyS sRNA was shown to be hyper - invade epithelial cells , secrete virulence - factors and to survive and strain which is highly attenuated in its ability to infect mice , virulent .
OxyS , a member of the OxyR regulon , is upregulated proliferate within macrophages .
These significant phenotypes by micromolar levels of peroxide and coordinates the cellular suggest that Hfq interacts with a number of sRNAs which are response to oxidative - stress .
54,76,77 As most trans - acting sRNAs depend AmgR is a 1.2 Kb antisense transcript encoded on the complementary strand to the mgtCBR operon .
The mgtC gene encodes a erone can facilitate the binding of an sRNA to its target mRNA upon Hfq to stabilize their binding to target mRNAs , the chap - protein necessary for Salmonella to survive within macrophages , and thereby prevent translation or induce target degradation .
to grow in low Mg 2 + environments and for virulence in mice .
66 Hfq can also bring about positive regulation by recruiting an sRNA to its target binding site and thereby de - stabilizing secondary structures which inhibit target translation .
78,79 Additionally , tem , senses low levels of Mg 2 + and the response regulator PhoP induces transcription of the mgtCBR operon .
AmgR regulates Hfq can regulate sRNA levels independently from their mRNA expression of the mgtCBR operon by de - stabilizing the mgtC and targets by protecting sRNAs from endonucleolytic decay .
80 There mgtB transcripts in an RNaseE - dependent manner .
An amgR are several suggestions as to how Hfq regulates sRNAs by controlling the base - pairing interaction between the sRNA and its mutant strain was found to be more virulent than the wild - type target mRNA .
The protein may act as a catalyst which increases the amgR promoter , leading to amgR expression in low Mg 2 + conditions .
Therefore , PhoP has an apparently paradoxical effect on and an mRNA to stabilize the imperfect base - pairing between the rate of complex formation between the trans - acting sRNA mgtC expression as it directly activates both mgtC and amgR , but the two RNAs , as duplex formation in the absence of Hfq is relatively poor .
81,82 AmgR has a repressive effect on mgtC .
This regulatory mechanism may have evolved to titrate the levels of MgtC expressed at In E. coli , Hfq has been demonstrated to interact with other appropriate times during infection .
67 RNA - associated proteins , such as PNPase , an exoribonuclease , The published roles of sRNAs in the virulence of S. and PAP , a poly ( A ) polymerase which may add an additional Typhimurium are summarized in Tables 1A and 1B , and it level of sRNA regulation by Hfq .
83 Recently , it was also suggested that Hfq plays a role in transcription termination in E. coli is likely that the list of sRNAs that are required for infection will increase in the future .
The expression profiles derived from by associating with the transcription termination factor Rho .
84 northern - blot and RT - PCR analyses of 19 island - encoded sRNAs Furthermore , limiting concentrations of Hfq can regulate sRNAs are shown in Figure 2 , and it is apparent that the levels of sRNAs as the abundance of Hfq per cell remains fairly constant while vary in different environmental conditions .
The recent profiling the amount of its target sRNAs can increase under - certain - conditions .
85 Sequestration of Hfq can therefore serve to modulate of 13 sRNAs during infection of fibroblasts showed that the levels of sRNAs varied during an infection time - course .
56 The levels of sRNA function by creating competition for binding between different sRNAs .
This was demonstrated in E. coli when overexpres - regulatory sRNAs within bacterial cells are likely to give clues to their function , and so expression profiling should be a useful sion of one sRNA led to a decrease in the accumulation of other discovery tool in the future .
sRNAs , as Hfq protein levels become limiting .

The alternative sigma factor RpoS ( σ 38 ) plays a key role in Salmonella infection and is profile of a strain overexpressing ArcZ which showed some simi - of regulation by Hfq was also suggested by the transcriptomic required for full virulence of S. Typhimurium .
68,69 Specifically , larities to that of an ∆ hfq mutant , indicating that an individual RpoS is important for persistence in lymphoid organs , such as the sRNA may displace other sRNAs from Hfq .

RNA - seq is Peyer 's patches .
69 RpoS also activates the plasmid - borne spvR and now the tool of choice for the discovery of novel small RNAs in spvABCD genes , which are required for intracellular growth and bacteria .

The addition of small RNA genes to existing genome Do not distribute .
AmgR is PhoP - dependent and PhoP directly binds 442 RNA Biology Volume 9 Issue 4 annotations will help to shed light on the complex nature of the bacterial transcriptome .
The recent publication of the transcriptional landscape of S. Typhimurium represents an important advance .
An RNA - seqbased approach was used to identify the major transcriptional start sites and to define the motif of σ 70 - dependent promoters .
44 About 140 sRNAs were found to be expressed at one stage of growth .
The fact that 60 novel sRNAs were discovered in a single set of experiments suggests that next - generation sequencingbased methods will make a big impact upon the RNA world .
In future , technical advances promise to extend the applicability of RNA - seq for the monitoring of transcriptional changes in complex environments or from the very low ( femtomolar ) amounts of RNA obtained from infected animals .
89,90 Another challenge will be to simplify the identification of mRNA targets .
Until now , pulse overexpression of a small RNA and subsequent monitoring of transcript levels using a microarray has been widely used to identify many mRNA targets , 91 but this is a labor - intensive approach .
Sequence - based target prediction tools are available on the web , and as they become more effective they will be a valuable and costeffective alternative to experimental approaches .
92 Although many un - answered questions remain about the precise role of sRNAs during the infection process , it is likely that the burgeoning field of sRNA biology will have a great impact on our understanding of Salmonella pathogenicity .
