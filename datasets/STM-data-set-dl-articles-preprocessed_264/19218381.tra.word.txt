Pearl , § and Christopher V. Rao * Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , Urbana , Illinois 61801 Type I fimbriae in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are surface appendages that facilitate binding to eukaryotic cells .
Expression of the fim gene cluster is known to be regulated by three proteins -- FimW , FimY , and FimZ -- and a tRNA encoded by fimU .
In this work , we investigated how these proteins and tRNA coordinately regulate fim gene expression .
Our results indicate that FimY and FimZ independently activate the P fimA promoter which controls the expression of the fim structural genes .
FimY and FimZ were also found to strongly activate each other 's expression and weakly activate their own expression .
FimW was found to negatively regulate fim gene expression by repressing transcription from the P fimY promoter , independent of FimY or FimZ .
Moreover , FimW and FimY interact within a negative feedback loop , as FimY was found to activate the P fimW promoter .
In the case of fimU , the expression of this gene was not found to be regulated by FimW , FimY , or FimZ .
We also explored the effect of fim gene expression on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) .
Our results indicate that FimZ alone is able to enhance the expression of hilE , a known repressor of SPI1 gene expression .
Based on our results , we were able to propose an integrated model for the fim gene circuit .
As this model involves a combination of positive and negative feedback , we hypothesized that the response of this circuit may be bistable and thus a possible mechanism for phase variation .
However , we found that the response was continuous and not bistable .
Type I fimbriae in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are proteinaceous surface appendages that carry adhesions specific for mannosylated glycoproteins ( 9 ) .
Type I fimbriae are involved in serovar Typhimurium pathogenicity by facilitating the binding to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells ( 43 ) .
In orally inoculated mice , a wild - type strain has been shown to cause more infections and deaths than a fim mutant strain ( 18 ) .
A fim mutant has also been shown to exhibit severalfold weaker binding to HEp - 2 and HeLa cells , and the defect in binding could be restored by complementing the fim system on a plasmid ( 4 ) .
Apart from type I fimbriae , mutations in different Salmonella fimbrial systems -- lpf , pef , and agf -- have all also been shown to greatly reduce virulence in mice ( 47 ) .
These systems appear to work synergistically in order to facilitate colonization of the ileum ( 5 ) .
In serovar Typhimurium , the fim gene cluster possesses all of the genes necessary for type I fimbrial production .
This gene cluster is composed of six structural genes , three regulators , and a tRNA specific for rare arginine codons ( AGA and AGG ) .
The structural genes fimA , fimI , fimC , fimD , fimH , and fimF are all expressed in one transcript from the P fimA promoter ( 26 , 36 -- 38 ) .
The regulators fimZ , fimY , and fimW are all expressed from independent promoters ( 44 , 46 , 48 ) .
The tRNA encoded by fimU is located at one end of the cluster and is required for the effective translation of the regulatory genes that all carry rare arginine codons ( 42 ) .

gene expression favored in static liquid medium , whereas growth on solid medium inhibits expression ( 17 ) .
Moreover , serovar Typhimurium cultures in fimbriae - inducing conditions contain cells in both fimbriated and nonfimbriated states ( 35 ) .
While the regulation of fim gene expression has been studied extensively in Escherichia coli , far less is known about the regulation in serovar Typhimurium ( 1 , 27 ) .
In particular , despite homology between the structural genes for type I fimbriae in E. coli and serovar Typhimurium , their expression is regulated in completely different manners .
No homologs of E. coli regulators , FimB and FimE , are present in serovar Typhimurium ( 24 , 28 ) .
Also , the serovar Typhimurium P fimA promoter is inactive in E. coli , indicating that the P fimA promoter is regulated by different factors in these two organisms ( 48 ) .
In serovar Typhimurium , the expression of the structural genes is regulated by three transcription factors , FimY , FimZ , and FimW ( 44 , 46 , 48 ) .
Both FimZ and FimY are essential for the expression of the structural genes from the P fimA promoter ( 48 ) .
In particular , the deletion of either the fimY or fimZ gene reduces expression from the P fimA promoter and prevents serovar Typhimurium from making type I fimbriae .
FimZ has been shown to bind the P fimA promoter and promote transcription ( 13 , 48 ) .
FimY , on the other hand , is thought to facilitate the activation of the P fimA promoter , as direct binding has not been observed ( 44 ) .
FimW is a negative regulator of fim gene expression ( 45 ) .
FimW has also been suggested to autoregulate its expression , as enhanced P fimW activity has been observed in the fimW mutant .
In DNA - binding assays , FimW was not observed to bind any of the fim promoters .
However , FimW was found to interact with FimZ in a LexA - based two - hybrid system in E. coli ( 45 ) .
Thus , a possible mechanism for FimWmediated repression may be that it binds FimZ and prevents it from activating transcription .
However , an analysis of the 3003 3004 SAINI ET AL. .
FimW amino - acid sequence predicts that it has a DNA - binding domain .
Moreover , it is related to a broad range of prokaryotic transcription factors , with its closest relatives being BpdT from Rhodococcus spp. and an uncharacterized response regulator , TodD , from Pseudomonas putida ( 29 , 30 ) .
Thus , FimW may also act by an alternate mechanism involving DNA binding .
In addition to these transcription factors , the fimU tRNA also plays a role in fim gene expression ( 42 ) .
All three regulators -- FimZ , FimY , and FimW -- contain a number of the rare arginine codons , AGA and AGG , recognized by the fimU tRNA .
In the case of FimY , fimU mutants have been shown to be nonfimbriated due to the inefficient translation of fimY mRNA .
This translational regulation results from FimY having three rare arginine codons within its first 14 amino - acids .
The phenotypic effect of the fimU mutation could , however , be overcome by expressing fimU from a plasmid or by changing these three rare arginine codons in fimY to ones more efficiently translated .
As a pathogen , serovar Typhimurium invades host cells by a process in which effector proteins are injected into the target cells with the help of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) type III secretion system ( 12 , 14 ) .
SPI1 gene expression is regulated by a number of proteins , with the critical activator being HilA ( 2 ) .
The expression of hilA , in turn , is regulated by three AraC - like transcriptional activators , hilC , hilD , and rtsA ( 19 , 21 , 22 , 32 , 40 , 41 ) .
HilD activity is controlled by HilE ; this protein binds HilD and is thought to prevent it from activating the P hilA promoter ( 6 , 8 ) .
FimY and FimZ have been previously shown to regulate SPI1 gene expression by repressing hilA expression through their activation of the P hilE promoter ( 7 ) .
In this work , we investigated the gene circuit regulating fim expression .
Using genetic approaches , we found that FimZ and FimY activate each other 's expression and that each protein can independently activate the P fimA promoter .
Moreover , FimZ and FimY were found to be weak autoactivators .
Our data also suggest that FimW - mediated repression occurs at the level of fimY transcription .
With regard to fimU , we found that none of the fim regulatory genes had any effect on its transcription .
As the fim gene circuit involves a combination of positive and negative feedback , we tested whether induction was bistable .
However , we found the cell population responded homogeneously when induced .
Finally , we looked at the link between the fim and SPI1 gene circuits and found that the P hilE promoter is activated solely by FimZ .
Collectively , these results allow us to propose an integrated model for the regulation of the fim gene circuit in serovar Typhimurium .

All bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Tables 1 and 2 , respectively .
All serovar Typhimurium strains are isogenic derivatives of strain 14028 ( American Type Culture Collection [ ATCC ] ) .
The generalized transducing phage of serovar Typhimurium P22 HT105/1int -201 was used in all transductional crosses ( 16 ) .

The plasmid pQE80L was digested with EcoRI and NheI , and the fragment was cloned into the conditional - replication , integration , and modular ( CRIM ) plasmid pAH125 digested with EcoRI and NheI ( 25 ) .
The resulting CRIM plasmid was called pVenus .
Venus transcriptional - fusions were made by amplifying the promoter of interest and then cloning these PCR fragments into the multiple cloning site of pVenus .
The fimA transcriptional - fusion was made using primers SS104F and SS104R .
The fimY transcriptional - fusion was made using primers SS037F and SS037R .
The fimZ transcriptional - fusion was made using primers SS103F and SS103R .
The fimW transcriptional - fusion was made using primers SS154F and SS154R .
The fimU transcriptional - fusion was made using primers SS162F and SS162R .
The hilE transcriptional - fusion was made using primers SS024F and SS024R .
The PCR fragments were then digested with KpnI and EcoRI ( sequences underlined ) and cloned into the multiple cloning site of the pVenus vector .
The resulting transcriptional - fusions were integrated into the serovar Typhimurium and E. coli chromosomes at the attB site using Int produced from the CRIM helper plasmid pInt - ts , thus creating single - copy transcriptional - fusions .
In the case of serovar Typhimurium , the integrated plasmid was moved into different mutant strains by P22 transduction .
Expression plasmids for fimY , fimZ , and fimW were made by cloning the respective gene into the multiple cloning site of pPROTet.E ( Clontech ) under the control of a strong promoter , P LTetO - 1 , resulting in plasmids pFimY , pFimZ , and pFimW ( 33 ) .
The plasmid pFimZ was made first by amplifying the fimZ gene using the primers SS106F and SS106R .
The PCR product was then digested with EcoRI and KpnI and cloned into pPROTet.E .
The plasmid pFimY was made by amplifying the fimY gene using the primers SS107F and SS107R .
The PCR product was then digested with SalI and BamHI and cloned into pPROTet.E .
The plasmid pFimW was made by amplifying the fimW gene using the primers SS160F and SS160R .
The PCR product was then digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into pPROTet.E .
In order to mutate the first three arginine rare codons at positions 7 , 9 , and 14 in fimY , primers SS162F and SS107R were used to amplify fimY with the rare arginine codons mutated to consensus arginine codons .
The resulting PCR product was used as a template with primers SS167F and SS107R .
The amplified product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the multiple cloning site of pPROTet.E .
The plasmid is called pFimY * .
In our expression plasmids , in the absence of TetR , the P LTetO - 1 promoter is constitutively active .
To regulate the expression levels from the P LTetO - 1 promoter , the tetR gene was also cloned downstream of the gene target into the plasmids as previously described ( 39 ) .
In this arrangement , in the absence of the inducer anhydrotetracycline ( aTc ) , expression from the promoter is inhibited due to TetR .
The inhibition , however , is relieved upon the addition of 100 ng/ml of aTc , and expression from the P LTetO - 1 promoter then takes place .
All constructs were sequenced prior to transforming into the wild - type and mutant strains .
The sequences for all the primers used in this study are given in Table 3 .
As an indirect measure of gene expression , end - point and dynamic measurements of the fluorescent reporter system were made using a Tecan Safire2 microplate reader .
For fluorescence end - point measurements , 1 ml culture was grown at 37 °C overnight and then subcultured 1:1,000 in fresh medium and grown in static conditions for 24 h at 37 °C .
A total of 100 l ofthe culture was then transferred to a 96 - well microplate , and the relative fluorescence and optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) measured .
The fluorescence readings were normalized with the OD 600 to account for cell density .
For time course measurements , overnight cultures at 37 °C were subcultured to an OD of 0.05 in fresh medium and allowed to grow to an OD of 0.15 .
A total of 100 l ofthe culture was then transferred to a 96 - well microplate and overlaid with 25 lofoil to prevent evaporation .
The temperature was maintained at 37 °C , and fluorescence and OD readings were taken every 5 min .
All experiments were done in triplicate and average values with the standard deviations reported .
Single - cell measurements were done similarly by growing the cells in noninducing conditions with vigorous shaking at 37 °C .
Overnight cultures were subcultured to an OD of 0.05 in fresh medium ( LB ) and grown in inducing conditions of high oxygen and no shaking at 37 °C .
Samples were collected at different time points by spinning the cells down , resuspending them in phosphate - buffered saline supplemented with - chloramphenicol ( 34 g/ml ) to stop all translation and arrest the cells in their respective state , and finally storing on ice .
All flow cytometry experiments were performed on a BD LRS II system ( BD Biosciences ) .
The data extraction and analysis for the flow cytometry experiments were done using FCS Express version 3 ( De Novo Software ) .
RESULTS FimZ and FimY are activators and FimW is a repressor of fim gene expression .
FimZ and FimY have previously been reported as activators of fim gene expression in serovar Typhimurium ( 44 , 48 ) .
Both have also been reported as essential for fimbriation , as the deletion of either one results in the loss of expression from the P fimA promoter ( 49 ) .
To understand the roles of FimZ and FimY in the fim gene circuit , we measured expression from the P fimA , P fimZ , P fimY , and P fimW promoters in the wild type and the fimZ , fimY , fimYZ , and fimW mutants ( Fig. 1 ) .
Chromosomally integrated Venus transcriptional reporters were employed as indirect measures of promoter activities ( 34 ) .
In the cases of all four promoters , activity levels were found to be about two times less active in the fimZ , fimY , and fimYZ mutants than in the wild type .
For all four promoters , note that no further reduction in promoter activity was observed in the double mutant .
In a fimW mutant , the activities of all four promoters were approximately two times higher than the wild - type levels .
While these results agree with previously published data regarding the fim system in serovar Typhimurium , they still do not tell us how FimW , FimY , and FimZ individually contribute to P fimA activation .
FimY and FimZ are strong activators of each other 's expression and weak activators of their own expression .
To determine the relative effect of FimY and FimZ on fim gene expression , the P fimY and P fimZ promoter activities were measured in a fimYZ mutant in which either FimZ or FimY was expressed from a strong , aTc - inducible promoter on a plasmid ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Using this system , we found that expressing FimZ in the fimYZ mutant led to a more than 10 - fold increase in P fimY activity ( Fig. 2A ) .
Likewise , expressing FimY in the fimYZ mutant led to about a 10 - fold increase in P fimZ levels .
In addition to their ability to activate each other 's promoters , FimY and FimZ were found to increase expression from their own promoters roughly threefold .
Even though E. coli makes type I fimbriae , the serovar Ty - 3006 SAINI ET AL. .
Therefore , we performed an identical set of experiments with E. coli using the serovar Typhimurium proteins and promoters .
Overall , the results were identical to those for serovar Typhimurium ( Fig. 2B ) .
In particular , FimZ expression led to a more than 10 - fold increase in P fimY promoter activity , and FimY expression led to a 10 - fold increase in P fimZ activity .
Both FimZ and FimY were again found to weakly activate expression from their own promoters .
The goal of these experiments was to remove the effect of any serovar Typhimuriumspecific regulatory mechanisms , thus allowing us to more confidently conclude that the observed results are due to direct interactions .
Collectively , these results show that FimY and FimZ strongly activate each other 's expression and weakly activate their own expression .
This cross - regulation also explains why both FimY and FimZ are required for strong P fimA promoter activity , as the expression of each is dependent on the other .
FimZ and FimY can independently activate expression from the P fimA promoter .
Next , we looked at how FimZ and FimY independently affected P fimA expression .
To investigate this problem , we measured P fimA promoter activity in a fimYZ mutant in which either FimY or FimZ was expressed using the aTc - inducible system .
FimZ expression was found to strongly ( 15 - fold ) activate the P fimA promoter , whereas FimY could only weakly ( more than twofold ) activate it ( Fig. 3 ) .
We also performed these experiments with E. coli with similar results ( data not shown ) .
Based on these results , we conclude that FimZ and FimY can both independently activate the P fimA promoter .
In the case of FimY , the weak activation of the P fimA promoter is likely due to its strong dependence on fimU tRNA ( see below ) ( 42 ) .
FimY activates the P fimW promoter , and FimW represses the P fimY promoter .
FimW has previously been observed to repress fim gene expression ( 45 ) .
Consistent with these results , we observed that P fimA , P fimW , P fimY , and P fimZ promoter activities were all elevated in a fimW mutant ( Fig. 1 ) .
To understand the mechanism of FimW - mediated repression , we first sought to identify the proteins that regulate expression from the P fimW promoter .
To answer this question , we measured the level of expression from the P fimW promoter in a fimYZ mutant in which FimW , FimY , and FimZ were independently expressed using the aTc - inducible system .
In the case of FimW and FimZ , expression had no effect on P fimW promoter activity VOL .
191 , 2009 TYPE I FIMBRIATION IN S. ENTERICA SEROVAR TYPHIMURIUM 3007 FIG. 1 .
FimY and FimZ are activators and FimW is a repressor of fim gene expression .
Shown is a comparison of the P fimA , P fimY , P fimZ , and P fimW promoter activities in the wild type and the fimY , fimZ , fimYZ , and fimW mutants .
Data are averages of the results from three experiments .
Each experiment was done in triplicate .
FimY and FimZ are strong activators of each other 's expression and also weak autoactivators .
Shown is a comparison of the P fimY and P fimZ promoter activities in a serovar Typhimurium fimYZ mutant ( A ) and E. coli ( B ) in which FimY and FimZ are independently expressed from an aTc - inducible promoter on a plasmid .
Note that tetR is also expressed from this plasmid in order to achieve aTcinducible expression .
Data are averages of the results from three experiments .
Each experiment was done in triplicate .
However , in the case of FimY , we observed a significant increase in P fimW promoter activity ( 1,052 381 relative fluorescence units [ RFU ] / OD [ uninduced ] versus 14,718 1,032 RFU/OD [ induced ] ) .
Similar results were also obtained when these experiments were performed with E. coli ( data not shown ) .
To identify the regulatory targets of FimW , we measured the expression of the P fimA , P fimZ , and P fimY promoters in a fimW fimYZ mutant in which FimW was expressed using the aTc - inducible system .
In the cases of the P fimA and P fimZ promoters , we found that FimW expression had no effect .
However , in the case of the P fimY promoter , FimW expression led to about a threefold decrease in P fimY activity ( 7,462 319 RFU/OD [ uninduced ] versus 2,781 188 RFU/OD [ induced ] ) .
Based on these results , we conclude that FimY activates expression from the P fimW promoter and that FimW represses expression from the P fimY promoter .
The P fimU promoter is not regulated by FimW , FimY , or FimZ .
Both fimY and fimZ contain rare arginine codons ( AGA and AGG ) and need fimU , a tRNA specific for rare arginine codons , for effective translation .
In a fimU mutant , P fimA activity was less than 10 - fold compared to the wild - type levels ( wild type , 16,723 1,173 RFU/OD ; the fimU mutant , 1,389 261 RFU/OD ) .
The expression of FimY in the fimU mutant using the aTc - inducible system , however , did not increase P fimA activity ( 988 319 [ uninduced ] versus 1,343 166 [ induced ] ) .
Replacing the rare arginine codons in the fimY gene with consensus ones did restore P fimA activity to the wild - type levels ( 817 73 RFU/OD [ uninduced ] versus 11,294 462 RFU/OD [ induced ] ) .
These experiments are consistent with previously published results ( 45 ) and indicate that fimU is essential for effective fimY translation .
As fimU has a strong effect on P fimA promoter activity , we hypothesized that it may be subject to regulation by the other proteins within the circuit .
To test this hypothesis , we measured P fimU promoter activity in different regulatory mutants .
Contrary to our hypothesis , we did not observe any change in P fimU promoter activity in any mutant ( wild type , 26,717 1,381 RFU/OD ; the fimZ mutant , 28,991 2,164 RFU/OD ; the fimY mutant , 25,884 1,983 RFU/OD ; the fimYZ mutant , 26,516 1,772 RFU/OD ; and the fimW mutant , 24,829 2,073 RFU/OD ) .
Likewise , we did not observe any change in P fimU promoter activity when FimW , FimY , and FimZ were expressed using the aTc - inducible system in wildtype serovar Typhimurium or E. coli ( data not shown ) .
Based on these results , we conclude that the P fimU promoter is not regulated by any fim protein .
FimZ alone is able to regulate SPI1 gene expression .
Previous studies have shown that both FimY and FimZ regulate 3008 SAINI ET AL. .
FimY and FimZ can independently activate expression from the P fimA promoter .
Shown is a comparison of P fimA promoter activities in a fimYZ mutant in which FimY and FimZ are independently expressed from an aTc - inducible promoter on a plasmid .
Data are averages of the results from three experiments .
Each experiment was done in triplicate .
SPI1 expression through their activation of the P hilE promoter ( 7 ) .
HilE , in turn , is known to bind HilD and repress the HilD - mediated activation of the P hilA , P hilC , P rtsA , and P hilD promoters ( 6 , 20 ) .
To test which protein activates the P hilE promoter , we independently expressed FimY and FimZ in a fimYZ mutant using the aTc - inducible system and then measured the level of expression from the P hilE promoter .
Of the two , only FimZ was found to affect P hilE expression ( 1,089 421 RFU/OD [ uninduced ] versus 17,654 2,234 RFU/OD [ induced ] ) .
Similar results were also observed for E. coli ( data not shown ) .
We note that these results are contrary to those previously reported , for which it was shown that both FimY and FimZ were necessary for activation of the P hilE promoter ( 7 ) .
One possible explanation for the discrepancy involves how the two gene products were selectively expressed .
In the original study , a DNA fragment containing the fimYZ gene cluster was cloned onto a plasmid and expressed using the tetracycline promoter .
To study their relative effects , each gene was selectively inactivated using a universal translational terminator .
As part of the P fimY promoter and the whole P fimZ promoter were left intact in their construct , transcriptional inference may have occurred between the various promoters .
In our design , we selectively cloned each gene and then expressed it from an inducible promoter , eliminating any potential interfering effects from having the native promoters still present .
Dynamics of fim gene expression .
Finally , we wished to investigate the dynamics of fim gene expression .
We first measured P fimA promoter activity in the wild type and the fimY , fimZ , fimYZ , and fimW mutants using a microplate reader ( Fig. 4A ) .
Consistent with our end - point measurements , we found that the P fimA promoter was weakly expressed in the fimY , fimZ , and fimYZ mutants .
Likewise , expression was enhanced in a fimW mutant .
Note that the microplate experiments tell us only about the average response of the population and nothing about how individual cells are behaving .
To test whether the cells were responding homogeneously , we also performed single - cell measurements of P fimA promoter activity at selected times in the wild type and a fimW mutant using FIG. 4 .
Dynamics of P fimA promoter activity .
( A ) Population average P fimA activity as a function of time in the wild type and the fimY , fimZ , fimYZ , and fimW mutants .
Data are averages of the results from a single experiment with an average of six independent cultures .
The experiment was repeated thrice , and identical results were observed .
( B ) Histogram of single - cell P fimA promoter activity at selected times in the wild type and a fimW mutant .
Single - cell measurements of promoter activity were obtained using flow cytometry .
Population distribution data are from a single experiment .
The experiment was repeated thrice , and identical results were observed ( data not shown ) .
flow cytometry ( Fig. 4B ) .
Our results indicate that individual wild - type and fimW mutant cells are responding homogeneously with respect to P fimA promoter activity at all times tested .
In other words , we did not observe any phase variation or heterogeneity with regard to P fimA promoter activity in our kinetic experiments .
DISCUSSION In this work , we investigated the regulatory gene circuit controlling the expression of type I fimbriae in serovar Typhimurium .
Using genetic approaches , we demonstrated that FimY and FimZ independently activate the P fimA promoter .
Of the two , FimZ was found to be the dominant activator .

Model for the type I fimbria gene circuit in serovar Typhimurium .
found that FimY and FimZ strongly activate each other 's expression and weakly activate their own expression .
In addition to these two positive regulators , a third regulator , FimW , is known to repress fim gene expression .
We found that FimW negatively regulates fim gene expression by repressing expression from the P fimY promoter .
Furthermore , FimW participates in a negative feedback loop as FimY was found to enhance P fimW expression .
Interestingly , these results suggest that FimY is both an activator and a repressor of fim gene expression , as it can directly activate the P fimZ , P fimY , and P fimA promoters and indirectly repress them by enhancing FimW expression .
In addition to these regulators , type I fimbriation is also dependent on the expression of a rare arginine codon tRNA , fimU .
However , our results showed that the P fimU promoter is not regulated by FimY , FimZ , or FimW .
The results suggest that fimU does not play a role in the internal regulation of the circuit .
Finally , we demonstrated that the previously observed coordinate regulation of SPI1 gene expression by the fim gene circuit ( 7 ) occurs through the activation of hilE expression by FimZ .
Based on these results , we are able to propose the following model for the fim gene circuit in serovar Typhimurium ( Fig. 5 ) .
According to our model , the induction of the fim circuit begins with the activation of the P fimY and P fimZ promoters , resulting in small amounts of fimY and fimZ being expressed .
FimY and FimZ then rapidly accumulate in the cell due to the positive feedback loop formed by the cross - activation of the P fimY and P fimZ promoters by these two proteins .
The expression of the type I fimbrial structural genes from the P fimA promoter commences when the concentration of FimY and FimZ within the cell rises beyond a critical level .
These two regulators can independently activate the P fimA promoter ; however , their expression is correlated , as each activates the other 's expression .
Moreover , FimY and FimZ protein expression levels are controlled by a negative feedback loop involving FimW .
In this loop , FimY activates the expression of the P fimW promoter , and FimW represses the expression of the P fimY promoter .
We hypothesize that this negative feedback loop involving FimW prevents the runaway expression of FimY and FimZ arising from their participation in interacting positive feedback .
Specifically , we hypothesize that when FimY and FimZ reach their optimum expression levels , the FimW negative feedback loop is activated and halts expression from the P fimY and P fimZ promoters .
While our model for the fim circuit explains internal regulation , it still does not explain how the circuit is activated .
In particular , we do not know which factors induce the P fimY and P fimZ promoters .
We suspect that these factors activate both promoters , as each alone exhibits some activity in a fimYZ mutant ( Fig. 1 ) .
In addition to these factors , another open question concerns whether fimU plays a role in regulating circuit dynamics .
While it is tempting to speculate that fimU expression is tuned in response to environmental signals and thus affects circuit dynamics , more likely this gene is constitutively expressed like other tRNAs .
Our results also indicate that the FimW - mediated inhibition of fim gene expression is through repression of the P fimY promoter .
Earlier reports suggested that FimW binds FimZ and somehow inhibits the FimZ - dependent activation of fim promoters ( 45 ) .
Moreover , FimW was not found to bind to the P fimW promoter .
Based on these results , FimW would appear to repress the P fimY promoter by preventing FimZ from activating it .
However , we found that FimW is able to repress the P fimY promoter in the absence of FimZ .
Our results would suggest that FimW directly binds the P fimY promoter and represses transcription independently of FimZ .
Consistent with our model , FimW has a C - terminal LuxR - type helix - turn - helix DNA domain ( SM00421 ) ( 31 ) .
However , at this time we have no direct experimental support for such a mechanism .
Moreover , an equally likely hypothesis is that repression by FimW is indirect .
Further experiments are clearly required to determine the mechanism of FimW - mediated repression and distinguish between these different putative models .
A final unanswered question concerns the role of the positive and negative feedback loops in the fim gene circuit .
Our initial hypothesis was that these feedback loops would result in bistability .
In particular , interacting positive and negative feedback loops are known to be sufficient ingredients for bistability ( 23 ) .
This bistability could potentially explain the phase variation observed in type I fimbriation during - growth in inducing conditions ( 35 ) .
To test whether the fim circuit exhibited bistability , we measured P fimA activity at single - cell resolution as a function of time .
Contrary to our initial hypothesis , we did not observe a heterogeneous or switch - like response in induction , the telltale indicator of bistability .
Rather , we observed a continuous or rheostat - like response in both the wild type and a fimW mutant ( 3 ) .
One possibility is that there is a lack of correlation between fim gene expression and the production of type I fimbria in serovar Typhimurium ( 11 ) .
Another is that the environment may dictate the response characteristics .
For example , under conditions different from those used in our study , Duguid and coworkers observed subpopulations of cells expressing type I fimbriae , indicative of phase variation ( 17 ) .
With these in mind , we hypothesize that the bacteria exhibit type I fimbria phase variation under specific environmental 3010 SAINI ET AL. .
conditions and that the regulation of this process involves posttranscriptional mechanisms as well .
