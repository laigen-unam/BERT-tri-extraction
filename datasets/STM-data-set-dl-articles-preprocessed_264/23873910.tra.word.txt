RflM Functions as a Transcriptional Repressor in the Autogenous Control of the Salmonella Flagellar Master Operon flhDC Hanna M. Singer , a Marc Erhardt , a , b Kelly T. Hughes c Microbiologie , Département de Médecine , Université de Fribourg , Fribourg , Switzerland a ; Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research , Braunschweig , Germany b ; Department of Biology , University of Utah , Salt Lake City , Utah , USA c Motility of bacteria like Salmonella enterica is a highly regulated process that responds to a variety of internal and external stimuli .
A hierarchy of three promoter classes characterizes the Salmonella flagellar system , and the onset of flagellar gene expression depends on the oligomeric regulatory complex and class 1 gene product FlhD 4 C 2 .
The flhDC promoter is a target for a broad range of transcriptional regulators that bind within the flhDC promoter region and either negatively or positively regulate flhDC operon transcription .
In this work , we demonstrate that the RflM protein is a key component of flhDC regulation .
Transposon mutagenesis was performed to investigate a previously described autoinhibitory effect of the flagellar master regulatory complex FlhD 4 C 2 .
RflM is a LuxR homolog that functions as a flagellar class 1 transcriptional repressor .
RflM was found to be the negative regulator of flhDC expression that is responsible for the formerly described autoinhibitory effect of the FlhD 4 C 2 complex on flhDC operon transcription ( K. Kutsukake , Mol .
We conclude that upon commencement of flagellar gene expression , the FlhD 4 C 2 complex initiates a regulatory feedback loop by activating rflM gene expression .
rflM encodes a transcriptional repressor , RflM , which fine - tunes flhDC expression levels .
The biosynthesis , assembly , and rotation of flagella require a significant amount of biosynthetic resources and energy ( 1 , 2 ) .
The expression of flagellar genes is regulated in response to various environmental conditions , which can determine the onset of flagellar biosynthesis and the overall degree of flagellation ( 3 , 4 ) .
One difference between flagellar gene expression in Escherichia coli and Salmonella is that under low - nutrient conditions , the flagellar regulon can be either induced ( E. coli ) or repressed ( Salmonella ) ( 5 -- 8 ) .
In all systems examined to date , flagellar synthesis is repressed during biofilm formation and upon entry into host cells ( 9 -- 12 ) .
The more than 60 genes of the flagellar regulon are organized into a transcriptional hierarchy of three promoter classes .
The flagellar master operon , flhDC ( under the control of the flagellar class 1 promoter ) , is transcribed to produce the FlhD 4 C 2 transcriptional activator complex that is needed for the activation of genes downstream in the flagellar transcriptional hierarchy , which are transcribed from flagellar class 2 promoters .
FlhD 4 C 2 - dependent genes are required for the structure and assembly of the flagellar hook - basal body ( HBB ) , which functions as the motor of the flagellum .
Also transcribed from a class 2 flagellar promoter is the fliA gene , which encodes the flagellum - specific transcription factor 28 , required to transcribe flagellar class 3 promoters .
Class 3 flagellar genes encode proteins required after HBB completion , including filament ( fliC and fljB ) , motor force generators ( motAB ) , and components of the chemosensory system ( che ) .
A broad range of factors positively and negatively regulate expression of the flhDC operon .
Transcription of flhDC from the class 1 promoter is dependent on the binding of the cyclic AMP - catabolite gene activator protein complex and can also be activated by the iron - regulatory protein Fur and by the nucleoid proteins Fis and H - NS ( 13 -- 17 ) .
Those regulatory factors bind directly to the flhDC promoter region , as shown for Fis in Salmonella and for Fur and H - NS in E. coli ( 15 , 17 , 18 ) .
There are numerous negative regulators of flagellar biosynthesis , including SlyA , a transcriptional regulator of flhDC ( 19 ) that is also required for Salmonella virulence ( 20 ) , RtsB , a Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) - encoded repressor of flagellar class 1 transcription ( 21 ) , LrhA ( 22 ) , and RcsB .
RcsB is reported to positively regulate SPI - 2 expression and favor Salmonella growth in macrophages ( 23 ) .
RcsB also binds an RcsB box in the flhDC promoter region to repress the flagellar master operon ( 23 , 24 ) .
Finally , flhDC transcription is reported to be under autogenous control ( 13 ) .
FlhD 4 C 2 is also under posttranscriptional regulation .
The flagellar protein FliZ is a product of the fliAZ operon , which is transcribed from flagellar class 2 and 3 promoters .
FliZ positively regulates additional flagellar class 2 gene expression ( 25 ) .
According to Saini et al. , FliZ posttranslationally alters the concentration of FlhD 4 C 2 ( 26 ) .
Data provided by Wada et al. suggest that FliZ has a repressing effect on YdiV , another posttranscriptional anti - FlhD 4 C 2 factor ( 27 ) .
YdiV binds to FlhD and prevents the FlhD 4 C 2 complex from binding to class 2 promoters , either by physically keeping the FlhDC complex away from free promoter DNA or by releasing FlhDC from the DNA - bound state ( 7 , 28 ) .
In an earlier study , we identified RflM , previously known as EcnR ( see Materials and Methods ) , as a repressor of flhDC transcription .
RflM is encoded in close proximity to the antidote/toxin gene pair ecnAB and exhibits the typical characteristics of an OmpR - like response regulator ( 29 ) .
It was therefore originally named EcnR ( entericidin gene R ) , but experimental analyses showed ecnAB to be positively regulated by S and negatively regulated by EnvZ/OmpR ( 29 ) .
There is no evidence for regulation of ecnAB by RflM ( EcnR ) .
In our previous work , we isolated flhDC promoter mutants that suppressed RflM inhibition ( 30 ) .
The inhibitory effect of RflM on motility has Published ahead of print 19 July 2013 Address correspondence to Kelly T. Hughes , hughes@biology.utah.edu .
An additional deletion of rcsDBC or an insertion in rcsB prevented the reported loss of motility of P ara rflM .
Here , we characterized the inhibitory effect of RflM on flhDC transcription .
FlhD 4 C 2 activates transcription of rflM , and in turn , RflM represses flhDC transcription .
The RflM - FlhD 4 C 2 feedback loop thereby accounts for the formerly described autoregulatory effect of FlhD 4 C 2 on flhDC operon transcription .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains , plasmids , and media .
All bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 .
Cells were cultured in lysogeny broth ( LB ) medium , supplemented with - tetracycline ( 15 gml 1 ) or anhydrotetracycline ( AnTc ) ( 1 gml 1 ) if needed .
Gene expression from the arabinose promoter was achieved by addition of 0.2 % L - arabinose to the medium .
The generalized transducing phage of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium P22 HT105/1 int - 201 was used in all crosses ( 31 ) .
Experiments using the virulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028s background were performed under SPI - 1-inducing conditions ( 24 , 32 , 33 ) .
Cultures were grown under high - osmolarity ( 1 % NaCl , final ) and low - oxygen ( without agitation ) conditions and if necessary supplemented with anhydrotetracycline and arabinose as described above .
Phenotypic Lac activity was observed using MacConkey lactose ( MacLac ) agar supplemented with 0.2 % arabinose if required .
The gene rflM was originally named ecnR since it was a putative regulatory protein linked to the toxin - antitoxin genes ecnAB ( 29 ) .
The change in nomenclature thereby displays the newly characterized function of RflM as a modulator of the flagellar master operon flhDC ( regulator of flagellar master operon ) .
Isolation of random T - POP insertions .
Strain TH15941 [ araBAD1007 : : flhD C flhC5213 : : MudJ fliA5886 ( R91C L207P ) ] carries the flhD C operon expressed from the chromosomal araBAD promoter ( P araBAD ) ( 19 ) .
It also carries a lac operon ( via insertion of the MudJ transposon into the flhC gene ) transcriptional reporter fusion to the chromosomal flhDC promoter ( flhC5213 : : MudJ ) and a fliA null allele that is defective in binding DNA ( 34 ) .
The introduction of the fliA null allele was to prevent any potential effects of 28 activity on the flhDC autoregulatory control .
Strain TH15941 is Lac but becomes Lac in the presence of arabinose ( Ara - Lac ) due to induction of flhD C transcription from P araBAD , resulting in autorepression of flhC - lac reporter transcription by FlhD 4 C 2 .
P22 phage prepared from T - POP donor strain TH3923 -LCB- pJS28 ( Ap r P22 - 9 ) F = 114 ( Ts ) Lac zzf - 20 : : Tn10 [ tetA : : MudP ] ( Tc s ) zzf - 3823 : : Tn10dTc [ del - 25 ] leuA414 hsdSB Fels2 -RCB- was used to introduce T - POP into strain TH15941 carrying plasmid pNK2881 , which constitutively expresses the Tn10 transposase gene carrying the ats - 1 and ats - 2 ( altered target specificity mutations ) alleles , which result in the random insertion of Tn10 derivatives into the chromosome ( 35 ) .
About 30,000 T - POP insertions in TH15941 were screened for loss of FlhD 4 C 2 autorepression , an Ara - Lac phenotype , in the presence of tetracycline ( Tc - Ara - Lac ) .
Thirty T - POP insertions that had an initial Ara - Lac phenotype in the presence of Tc were isolated and were further characterized as described in Results .
- Galactosidase activity was measured according to method of Zhang and Bremer ( 36 ) with minor modifications as described in the following .
For each strain , a minimum of three independent biological replicates were picked from individual colonies .
For experiments performed with LT2 , cells were grown overnight in general LB medium .
Strain 14028s was grown under SPI - 1 inducing conditions in LB medium supplemented with 1 % NaCl ( final ) and without shaking .
LT2 samples were diluted 1:100 in LB - medium supplemented with 0.2 % L - arabinose and 1 g ml 1 anhydrotetracycline if needed .
Cultures were grown until mid - log phase at 37 °C before permeabilization of the cells September 2013 Volume 195 Number 18 jb.asm.org 4275 Singer et al. using 100 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 20 mM KCl , 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0.08 % CTAB ( hexadecyl - trimethyl ammonium bromide ) , 0.04 % sodium deoxycholate , and 5.4 lml 1 - mercaptoethanol .
To start the reaction , substrate solution containing 60 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 40 mM NaH 2 PO 4 ,1 mgml 1 o - nitrophenyl - - D - galactoside ( ONPG ) and 2.7 g ml 1 - mercaptoethanol was added , and the time was measured until sufficient color had been developed .
The enzyme reaction was then stopped by addition of 1 M sodium carbonate ( Na 2 CO 3 ) , and remaining cell fragments were pelleted by centrifugation at full speed .
The optical density of the supernatant at 405 nm was measured , and Miller units were calculated according to the method of Miller ( 37 ) .
All samples were normalized against their corresponding arabinoseinduced wild - type control in the presence or absence of anhydrotetracycline .
For statistical analysis , an unpaired t test was performed using the software program GraphPad Prism version 5.0 d for Mac ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA , USA ) .
The P value summaries are displayed above the respective bars .
RNA isolation and quantitative real - time PCR .
RNA isolation was performed for three independent biological replicates using the RNeasy minikit ( Qiagen ) .
For removal of genomic DNA , RNA was treated with DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C using a DNA - free RNA kit ( Zymo Research ) or on - column treatment was performed using kit 79254 ( Qiagen ) .
Subsequently , RNA samples were reverse transcribed according to the RevertAid first - strand cDNA synthesis kit ( Fermentas ) .
Quantitative real - time PCRs were carried out using the EvaGreen quantitative real - time PCR ( qPCR ) master mix ( Bio - Rad ) and primers 5 = - TCTCAACGATGCCTTA CCCGAACA plus 5 = - GCAAGCTCATGTAAAGGCGTGTGT ( rflM ) , 5 = - CTGCTCAAAGAGCTGGTGTATCA plus 5 = - AGCGCGTTACAGTCTG CTCAT ( gyrB ) , 5 = - CAACCTGTTCGTACGTATCGAC plus 5 = - CAGCTC CATCTGCAGTTTGTTG ( rpoB ) , 5 = - CAACAGTATGCGCGTGATGAT plus 5 = - CGACGCAGAGCTTCATGATC ( rpoD ) , 5 = - TTGCAGAAATGA GCCATTACGCCG plus 5 = - GACGTTCAGC GCGAATGATGGTTT ( gmk ) , 5 = - GTAGGCAGCTTTGCGTGTAG plus 5 = - TCCAGCAGTTGTG GAATAATATCG ( flhDC ) , 5 = - AACGTCTATTTTGTGAAAACCAAAG plus 5 = - AGACTCCAGAATCCCGTTTTC ( flgE ) , and 5 = - AACGACGGTA TCTCCATTGC plus 5 = - ATTTCAGCCTGGATGGAGTC ( flagellin , conserved region of fliC and fljB ) .
Experiments were performed on a CFX96 real - time PCR instrument ( Bio - Rad ) , with the exception of the experiment leading to Fig. 5 .
Here we used a Rotor - Gene Q 2plex real - time PCR system ( Qiagen ) .
Relative changes in mRNA levels were analyzed according to the Pfaffl method ( 38 ) and normalized against the transcript levels of the reference genes rpoB , rpoD , gyrB , and gmk .
Motility plates were prepared as described previously ( 30 , 39 ) .
Strains were picked from fresh individual colonies grown on LB and pocked into 0.2 % arabinose - containing ( Ara ) and arabinose - free ( Ara ) motility agar .
Plates were kept at 30 °C and grown for 5.5 h ( Ara ) and 6.5 h ( Ara ) , respectively .
The diameter of the motility swarm was measured using the software program NIH ImageJ 1.44 g .
In order to increase the contrast between motility and background , contrast levels were equally adjusted using iWork Pages software .
For immunostaining of flagellar filaments , fliC - ON phase - locked ( hin - 5717 ) Salmonella bacteria containing a deletion of either rflM or rcsB were grown to mid - log phase and immobilized on poly - L-lysine - treated coverslips .
The bacteria were fixed by addition of 5 % formaldehyde and 0.5 % glutaraldehyde .
Membrane staining was performed using FM - 64 ( 0.5 mg ml 1 ) .
Flagella were stained using polyclonal anti - FliC antibodies ( rabbit ) and anti - rabbit - Alexa 488 secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) .
Images were collected using an inverted Axio Observer.Z1 fluorescence microscope ( Zeiss ) .
RESULTS FlhD 4 C 2 activates its own repressor , RflM .
The master regulatory operon of flagellar gene expression , flhDC , is under autogenous repression ( 13 ) .
It was reported that increased levels of active FlhD 4 C 2 complex resulted in decreased flhDC transcription in cases where 28 ( FliA ) was absent or where 28 was in the presence of its cognate anti- 28 factor FlgM ( 13 ) .
We confirmed the autoregulatory effect of FlhD 4 C 2 on flhDC operon transcription in the presence of both 28 and FlgM as shown in Fig. 1 .
When FlhD 4 C 2 was overexpressed from the arabinose promoter upon addition of 0.2 % arabinose , a chromosomal flhC - lac transcriptional - fusion under the control of the flhDC promoter reported a drop in flhClac expression of about 2 - fold ( Fig. 1A ) .
It was shown previously that tuning expression of FlhD 4 C 2 from the arabinose promoter by addition of 0.05 % to 0.6 % arabinose resulted in a steady 60 - fold increase in flhDC mRNA levels compared to flhDC expressed from the native P flhDC promoter ( 19 ) .
In addition , the FlhD 4 C 2 levels needed for maximal activation of downstream flagellar genes appear to be rapidly saturated , since class 2 and class 3 gene expression increased only 3 - to 5 - fold in the tested range of P ara flhDC overexpression ( 19 ) .
To address whether FlhD 4 C 2 could directly repress its own transcription or if FlhD 4 C 2 mediated autorepression indirectly by activating the transcription of an unknown flhDC operon repressor , we performed T - POP transposon mutagenesis and screened for potential FlhD 4 C 2 - dependent repressors of flhDC gene transcription .
T - POP transposons are derivatives of transposon Tn10 that can transcribe chromosomal genes adjacent to the site of insertion from tetracycline - inducible promoters within the T - POP element ( 40 ) .
T - POP lacks transposition functions , which can be provided in trans byaTn10 transposase expression plasmid present in recipient cells ( 40 ) .
After transposon insertions have been isolated and moved into a strain lacking Tn10 transposase , the T - POP transposon is no longer capable of further transposition .
Strain TH15941 ( araBAD1007 : : flhD C flhC5213 : : MudJ fliA5886 ) carries an flhC - lac transcriptional - fusion and the flhD C operon expressed from an arabinose - inducible promoter ( P ara flhD C ) .
This strain is Lac in the presence of arabinose due to FlhD 4 C 2 autorepression .
The phenotype on lactose MacConkey ( MacLac ) agar is shown in Fig. 2 .
MacLac indicator medium shows the optimal sensitivity in the intermediate lac operon expression range ( 41 ) .
It thus represents the indicator medium of choice to visualize repression of flhDC , such as flhDC autorepression ( P ara flhD C ) or repression of flhDC by the known transcriptional regulator RcsB ( P ara rcsB ) .
Using MacLac indicator medium , a transition from white ( Lac ) to dark - pink ( Lac ) colonies can be readily observed ( Fig. 2 ) .
Strain TH15941 was mutagenized with the T - POP transposon Tn10dTc [ del - 25 ] and screened for insertions that were Lac ( dark pink ) in the presence of arabinose due to loss of FlhD 4 C 2 autorepression .
The T - POP transposon Tn10dTc [ del - 25 ] is deleted for the terminator of the tetA tetracycline resistance gene transcript , allowing transcription from the tetA promoter ( P tetA ) within the T - POP transposon into adjacent chromosomal DNA ( 40 ) .
Four groups of T - POP transposon insertion mutants that resulted in the apparent loss of FlhD 4 C 2 autorepression ( i.e. , Lac in the presence of arabinose [ Ara - Lac ] ) were obtained .
One group included T - POP insertions linked to the arabinose region and are presumed to have disrupted the flhDC operon .
A second group included T - POP insertions linked to the flhC - lac operon fusion and are presumed to be polar insertions between the flhDC promoter and the lac operon inserted in flhC , thereby putting lac directly under P tetA control .
These two groups of Ara - Lac T - POP insertions in strain TH15941 were not further charac - 4276 jb.asm.org Journal of Bacteriology RflM - Dependent Regulation of flhDC FIG 1 RflM inhibits its own activator ( flhDC ) .

The remaining two groups of Ara - Lac T - POP insertions were unlinked to both ara and flhC - lac fusion chromosomal positions and represented candidates for insertions in a gene or genes responsible for FlhD 4 C 2 - dependent repression of flhDC operon transcription .
One group included two insertions that exhibited an Ara - Lac phenotype only in the presence of tetracycline ( Tc ) .
These were presumed to turn on an activator of flhDC gene expression from P tetA that is currently being subjected to further characterization .

T - POP insertions of this group that were linked to known negative regulators of flhDC expression ( e.g. , lrhA , rtsB , and rcsB ) were not characterized further .
Of the remaining unlinked T - POP insertions , we sequenced 10 Tc - independent Ara - Lac insertion mutants , and DNA sequence analysis revealed transposition of the T - POP element into the rflM locus ( Table 2 ) .
This indicated that rflM encodes an FlhD 4 C 2 - induced repressor of flhDC transcription ( the `` autorepressor '' ) .
RflM inhibits flhC gene transcription .
The results of the random T - POP transposon mutagenesis suggested that RflM functions as an FlhD 4 C 2 - dependent inhibitor of flhDC operon transcription .
Accordingly , we tested autoinhibition of flhDC transcription upon induction of P ara flhD C in the absence of the putative regulator RflM ( Fig. 1A ) .
The inhibitory effect of P ara flhD C induction on flhDC gene transcription was lost in the rflM deletion strain , confirming that RflM was responsible for the FlhD 4 C 2 autoregulation effect observed by Kutsukake ( 13 ) .
In order to confirm that RflM represses flhDC operon transcription , we analyzed flhDC mRNA levels in a strain that expresses excess rflM from an arabinose - inducible promoter ( P ara rflM ) .
As shown in Fig. 1B , under P ara rflM - inducing conditions , flhDC expression decreased about 4 - fold in a reverse transcriptase qPCR ( RT - qPCR ) assay .
Reduction in flhDC transcription was also observed under P ara rflM - inducing conditions using an flhC - lac operon fusion reporter shown in Fig. 1C .
Effect of RflM on rflM gene transcription .
We investigated whether RflM was under autogenous control .
To test if RflM autoregulates its own transcription , we utilized a previously isolated rflM - lac operon transcriptional - fusion ( 30 ) .
A strain overexpressing RflM from the arabinose promoter ( P ara rflM ) was analyzed in comparison to the wild - type control , where the arabinose genes araBAD were deleted by inserting an Flp recombination target ( FRT ) - chloramphenicol acetyltransferase - FRT ( FCF ) resistance cassette ( araBAD : : FCF ) .
Both strains carried the above - mentioned rflM - lac reporter and a T - POP insertion in the promoter region of flhDC .
The latter allows the activation of flhDC transcription upon addition of anhydrotetracycline ( AnTc ) , which activates T - POP - encoded tetA and tetR gene transcription , and prevents flhDC autorepression .
As shown in Fig. 1D , the absence of FlhD 4 C 2 ( e.g. , in the absence of the inducer AnTc , the flhDC operon in these strains is not transcribed ) resulted in a reduction of rflM - lac transcription , presumably because the rflM gene required FlhD 4 C 2 for its transcription .
However , induction of rflM from the arabinose locus had no effect on the remaining rflM - lac transcription , suggesting that RflM does not play an additional role in its own transcriptional regulation except through regulation of flhDC .
FlhD 4 C 2 activates its own repressor , RflM .
The results described above indicate that FlhD 4 C 2 activates its own repressor , RflM .
To analyze the effects of P ara flhD C induction on rflM gene expression , we analyzed - galactosidase activity of a transcriptional rflM - lac reporter in Salmonella enterica LT2 and the virulent strain Salmonella enterica ATCC 14028s to exclude strainspecific effects and in addition analyze a potential cross talk between the interconnected virulence and flagellar gene regulation networks .
The attenuated strain , LT2 , was grown under regular LB conditions , whereas the virulent strain , 14028s , was grown under high - salt and low - oxygen conditions , known to induce the virulence - associated Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) ( 24 , 32 , 33 ) .
In both strain backgrounds , a 3 - fold induction of rflM was observed under P ara flhD C - inducing conditions ( Fig. 3A ) .

also performed complementary quantitative real - time PCR assays .
Upon P ara flhD C - inducing conditions , the rflM mRNA level was significantly increased , as shown in Fig. 3B .
Effect of RflM on motility and flagellation .
We have shown above that overexpression of rflM resulted in a substantial repression of the flagellar master regulatory operon , flhDC .
We therefore analyzed the effect of a deletion of the rflM gene and rflM overexpression on motility and flagellar assembly .
A deletion in rflM resulted in an increase in motility compared to the wild type ( Fig. 4A and B ) and on average one additional flagellum per cell body ( Fig. 4C ) .
Under rflM - overexpressing conditions ( labeled rflM1 ) , a substantial loss of motility was observed and motility was significantly impaired compared to that with the known repressor RcsB ( Fig. 4B ) .
Additionally , we analyzed gene expression of the three flagellar promoter classes by quantitative real - time PCR .
Expression of all the classes was upregulated in the rflM background , with a decreasing effect along the transcriptional flagellar hierarchy ( Fig. 5 ) .
While no significant difference could be observed between the two regulators RflM and RcsB in terms of class 1 ( flhDC ) expression , the RflM effect is clearly visible at later class 2 ( flgE ) and class 3 ( fliC and fljB ) transcription .
This effect supports the observation that the RflM effect on motility and flagellation was more pronounced than that of RcsB .
In summary , our results support a regulatory feedback loop for the autogenous control of flhDC operon transcription .
Expression of flhDC leads to production of a functional FlhD 4 C 2 activator complex , which , in addition to activating flagellar class 2 pro- FIG 5 Flagellar class 1 , 2 , and 3 gene expression of rflM and rcsB mutants .
Relative expression of the different flagellar promoter classes under wild - type , rflM , and rcsB conditions is shown .
Quantitative real - time analysis was performed with two independent mRNA purifications .
Expression levels are shown for class 1 ( flhDC ) , class 2 ( hook subunit flgE ) , and class 3 ( flagellin subunits fliC and fljB ) gene products .
gyrB , rpoB , and gmk served as reference genes for normalization .
September 2013 Volume 195 Number 18 jb.asm.org 4279 Singer et al. moter transcription for hook - basal body assembly , activates rflM gene transcription .
RflM , when produced , acts to inhibit flhDC transcription .
We have thereby demonstrated that this feedback loop is responsible for the formerly observed autoregulatory effect of FlhD 4 C 2 .
DISCUSSION In this study , we show that the formerly observed autoregulatory effect of the flagellar master regulator FlhD 4 C 2 is caused by FlhD 4 C 2 - dependent production of a negative regulator , RflM .
FlhD 4 C 2 and RflM thereby form a regulatory feedback loop , which regulates the rate of flagellar gene expression with respect to the level of already - initiated flagellar biosynthesis .
Expression of rflM is directly coupled to the presence of functional FlhD 4 C 2 , which could be concluded from the fact that the amount of rflM mRNA was significantly increased under FlhD 4 C 2 overexpression conditions .
Conclusively , flhDC expression decreased in the presence of excess RflM , and FlhD 4 C 2 autoregulation was completely abolished in an rflM deletion background .
Flagellar synthesis is dependent on a hierarchy of three transcriptional promoter classes , with the master regulator , FlhD 4 C 2 , at the top .
FlhD 4 C 2 is a known DNA binding complex that has been shown to bind to the 40 to 80 regions of multiple flagellar operons ( 42 , 43 ) and together with 70 targets RNA polymerase to transcribe class 2 flagellar promoters ( 44 ) .
FlhD 4 C 2 allows expression of the subsequent flagellar genes ( under the control of the FlhD 4 C 2 - dependent class 2 promoters ) needed for hook - basalbody assembly .
The presence of functional FlhD 4 C 2 thereby plays the main role in determining whether or not flagella are synthesized .
Accordingly , negative feedback between the FlhD 4 C 2 protein and flhDC operon expression would prevent the cell from synthesizing an excess of flagella .
Overexpression of flhDC has previously been described to turn off flhDC operon transcription and was attributed to a direct inhibition of the flhDC operon by the FlhD 4 C 2 complex ( 13 ) .
It was unclear , however , whether this inhibitory function was direct or indirect .
Thus , we designed a genetic selection and screen to differentiate between two possibilities : in addition to the known role of FlhD 4 C 2 as a transcriptional activator of flagellar class 2 promoters , FlhD 4 C 2 could either act as a direct repressor of its own ( flhDC operon ) transcription or as an activator of an unknown repressor of flhDC operon transcription .
Our results support the latter possibility .
The identification of an FlhD 4 C 2 - dependent flhDC regulator allows us to postulate a novel regulatory feedback loop that accounts for the previously described autoregulation of FlhD 4 C 2 .
The loop consists of two mechanisms : ( i ) FlhD 4 C 2 activates rflM and ( ii ) RflM represses flhDC transcription .
With this study , we added a new component to the complex regulatory mechanisms that controls expression and activity of the flagellar master regulator FlhD 4 C 2 .
Many environmental and regulatory stimuli are integrated at the level of 70 - dependent transcription of the flhDC operon .
Expression of FlhD 4 C 2 therefore forms the prerequisite for the initiation of flagellar synthesis by activation of flagellar class 2 and 3 gene expression .
Regulation at the level of flhDC operon transcription is thus the main target by which flagellar synthesis is regulated .
In this study , we further characterized the flhDC master operon regulation that is placed on top of the flagellar gene expression cascade .
In addition to environmental ( external ) stimuli that control expression of flhDC , an endogenous ( internal ) regulation mechanism that directly provides feedback of FIG 6 Possible models of the regulatory flhDC feedback loop .
Panel A shows the formerly described autoregulatory effect of flhDC , where FlhD 4 C 2 directly represses flhDC operon transcription .
In contrast to this previous model , FlhD 4 C 2 induces expression of rflM , and the RflM protein acts as a repressor of flhDC transcription .
Repression of RflM might be direct but facilitated by RcsB ( B ) .
Alternatively , RflM might repress flhDC independently of RcsB ( C ) or act as a corepressor of RcsB ( D ) .
FlhD 4 C 2 protein levels exists .
An increase in flhDC expression and the subsequent flagellar synthesis requires a mechanism of counterbalance .
Such an effect was previously referred to as FlhD 4 C 2 autorepression ( Fig. 6A ) , which our results show to be a regulatory feedback loop via RflM .
A previous study indicated an additional role of the RcsCDB system in the RflM - mediated repression of flhDC ( 30 ) .
The response regulator RcsB has been shown to directly bind to the flhDC promoter region ( 23 , 24 ) .
Accordingly , different scenarios of RflM - dependent repression of flhDC can be envisioned , and follow - up experiments are currently in progress to test the role RcsB in this regulation network .
RflM could directly repress flhDC , while RcsB takes over a supporting role ( Fig. 6B ) .
Alternatively , RcsB could directly repress flhDC independently of RflM , and both proteins might compete for binding to the flhDC promoter region ( Fig. 6C ) .
Finally , RflM could act as a corepressor of RcsB ( Fig. 6D ) .
The complexity and the hierarchical structure of the flagellar system explain the frequency by which endogenous regulation mechanisms occur .
Feedback regulation in the flagellar system targets multiple levels throughout biosynthesis of the flagellum : ( i ) on the level of flhDC gene expression via FlhD 4 C 2 - dependent activation of the LuxR - type repressor RflM , ( ii ) on the level of FlhDC protein complex via posttranscriptional repression ( FliT and YdiV ) and activation ( FliZ ) of FlhDC - dependent class 2 gene expression , and ( iii ) on the level of flagellar class 3 gene expression by secretion of the anti- 28 factor FlgM after HBB completion and positive regulation of flgM translation by FlgN ( 45 -- 47 ) .
In summary , the following scenario could be envisioned to couple the assembly process of the flagellum to flagellar gene expression .
70 - dependent class 1 transcription of flhDC leads to formation of the flagellar master regulatory complex FlhD 4 C 2 .
FlhD 4 C 2 activates class 2 gene transcription , as well as that of its own repressor , rflM .
While class 2 products build up the HBB , FliZ activates FlhDC complex and RflM acts as a repressor of flhDC transcription .
Upon completion of the HBB , the secretion specificity switch re - 4280 jb.asm.org Journal of Bacteriology RflM - Dependent Regulation of flhDC sults in secretion of FlgM and FliD , and class 3 gene expression takes place .
Secretion of FliD upon HBB completion allows FliT to bind FlhDC complex and inhibit FlhD 4 C 2 activity .
Reduced activity of FlhDC decreases expression of rflM and allows a new cycle of flagellar gene expression and assembly starting with derepression of the flhDC promoter .
