Hinton 1 * 1 Molecular Microbiology Group , Institute of Food Research , Colney , Norwich , United Kingdom , 2 Oxford Gene Technology , Yarnton , Oxford , United Kingdom Histone - like nucleoid structuring protein ( H - NS ) is a modular protein that is associated with the bacterial nucleoid .
We used chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine the binding sites of H - NS and RNA polymerase on the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium chromosome .
We found that H - NS does not bind to actively transcribed genes and does not co - localize with RNA polymerase .
This shows that H - NS principally silences gene expression by restricting the access of RNA polymerase to the DNA .
H - NS had previously been shown to preferentially bind to curved DNA in - vitro .
In fact , at the genomic level we discovered that the level of H - NS binding correlates better with the AT - content of DNA .
This is likely to have evolutionary consequences because we show that H - NS binds to many Salmonella genes acquired by lateral gene transfer , and functions as a gene silencer .
The removal of H - NS from the cell causes un - controlled expression of several Salmonella pathogenicity islands , and we demonstrate that this has deleterious consequences for bacterial fitness .
Our discovery of this novel role for H - NS may have implications for the acquisition of foreign genes by enteric bacteria .

DOI : 10.1371 / journal.ppat .0020081 Introduction Bacteria have an extraordinary capacity to adapt to changes in their external environment .
The histone - like nucleoid - structuring protein ( H - NS ) plays a key role for many Gram - negative bacteria by integrating a complex range of environmental signals such as temperature and osmolarity [ 1,2 ] .
Consequently , H - NS acts as a pleiotropic regulator of gene expression [ 3 ] .
Deletion of hns resulted in altered gene expression of almost 5 % of Escherichia coli genes , of which more than 80 % were up - regulated [ 4 ] .
H - NS also influences the major DNA transactions , such as replication , transposition and recombination [ 5 ] .
The modular nature of the H - NS protein is reflected by the three distinct domains , involved in DNA binding , dimerisation , and the formation of high order oligomers [ 3,6 ] .
Unlike classical regulatory repressor and activator proteins , H - NS does not recognise particular sequences of DNA ; however , a number of in - vitro studies have shown that the protein has a small preference for curved DNA [ 7 -- 9 ] .
It has been proposed that after binding to a preferential site , H - NS oligomerizes cooperatively along the DNA to cover a larger region [ 10 -- 12 ] .
This idea is supported by the observation that mutant H - NS proteins that are unable to oligomerize no longer repress the expression of some promoters [ 10,13 ] .
Following the binding of H - NS , changes in transcription are likely to be caused by modulations of DNA topology ( i.e. compacting and looping DNA , and the constraint of DNA supercoils [ 14 ] ) .
As DNA curvature is most pronounced around the transcriptional start of genes [ 15 ] a simple model involving the preferential binding of H - NS to regulatory regions has been considered [ 16 ] , with resultant effects upon global gene expression .
However , since curved DNA is found near most promoters [ 17 ] , and the majority of bacterial promoters are not regulated by H - NS ( i.e. H - NS - independent ) , it has never been clear how specificity was achieved .
The interaction between H - NS and DNA has been studied in - vitro by traditional gel - retardation and DNA - footprinting experiments , but knowledge of how and where H - NS attaches to DNA in - vivo has remained indirect .
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip ( ChIP - on - chip ) [ 18,19 ] , we have now addressed the question of where H - NS binds to DNA in the macro - molecular context of a living bacterial cell and show how this correlates with the distribution of RNA polymerase on the chromosome .
Results/Discussion H - NS and RNA polymerase binding sites on the chromosome of live Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ) LT2 cells were identified by ChIP - on - chip , using a tiled oligonucleotide microarray ( Figure 1 , outer circles ) .
We first identified 495 chromosomal regions that bound RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) during exponential - growth in Luria Broth ( LB , Materials and Methods ) , corresponding to 965 genes ( Table S1 ) .
As expected , the strongest RNAP binding was observed for genes involved in ribosome , flagella and Editor : Ralph R.

E - mail : jay.hinton@bbsrc.ac.uk $ Current address : School of Biosciences , University of Birmingham , Edgbaston , Birmingham , United Kingdom PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 0746 August 2006  Volume 2  Issue 8  e81 Genome - Wide Silencing in Salmonella Synopsis In recent decades , gene silencing has been well - characterised in plants and animals , and involves the prevention of transcription by DNA - methylation and histone - modification , or interference with translation by small RNA molecules .
This issue of PLoS Pathogens reports the discovery that global gene silencing also occurs in bacteria .
The novel mechanism is mediated by the highly abundant histone - like nucleoid structuring protein ( H - NS ) , which blocks the expression of 254 genes in wild - type Salmonella .
Many of these genes were acquired through horizontal gene transfer , including pathogenicity islands , and these are silenced by the binding of H - NS to AT - rich chromosomal regions .
The study reveals that H - NS prevents the uncontrolled transcription of genes within pathogenicity islands to ensure that bacterial fitness is maintained .
It is suggested that H - NS plays a role in bacterial evolution by influencing both the acquisition and maintenance of foreign DNA .
Consultation of transcriptomic data for LT2 grown to exponential phase [ 2 ] revealed that RNAP - bound genes were expressed at high levels , and RNAP binding was only associated with genes that were transcribed ( Figure 2 ) .
The ChIP - on - chip experiments using anti - H-NS monoclonal antibodies repeatedly displayed high levels of signal across most of the chromosome ( unpublished data ) .
We confirmed this observation by repeating the experiment with H200 anti - H-NS polyclonal antibodies , and obtained very similar results ( unpublished data ) .
In contrast , the RNAP ChIP - on - chip showed a much lower background signal .
These findings suggest that the low sequence specificity of H - NS and its high abundance [ 20 ] allows the protein to bind at differing levels throughout most of the chromosome .
Significantly , the background signal was not homogeneously distributed over the genome ; rRNA genes exhibited a low H - NS signal suggesting that H - NS is specifically excluded from highly transcribed genes ( Figure 3 ) .
We identified 422 regions that bound H - NS , corresponding to 746 genes , which we suggest contain high - affinity binding sites ( Table S1 ) , also known as H - NS nucleation sites [ 5 ] .
To validate the data , we initially focused on the H - NS binding sites for published H - NS - dependent genes , such as proV and leuO .
ProV is a well characterised H - NS - dependent osmoinducible transport protein in Salmonella [ 21 ] .
H - NS has been shown to repress proV by binding to a DNA - region , the downstream regulatory element , which is located within the proV structural gene [ 7 ] .
H - NS also transcriptionally represses Figure 1 .

leuO , a gene coding for a pleiotropic regulator of gene expression , by binding to a curved AT - rich DNA region upstream of the leuO promoter [ 12 ] .
Our data confirm the reported binding patterns ( Figure 3 ) .
To add biological relevance to our ChIP - on - chip data we correlated our results with the transcriptomic analysis of strain LT2 and its congenic hns - deletion mutant JH4000 during late - exponential growth [ 2 ] .
Genes bound by H - NS are generally expressed at lower than average levels in the wild - type LT2 strain ( Figure 2A ) .
A large proportion ( 254 or 47 % ) of the 535 genes de - repressed in JH4000 was bound by H - NS in the LT2 strain .
In contrast , only 20 ( 6.1 % ) of the 330 genes down - regulated in JH4000 were bound by H - NS .
These findings demonstrate a role for H - NS as a global gene silencer , and this was confirmed by the observed negative correlation between H - NS binding and gene expression levels ( Figure 2C ) .
Expression of about half of the genes that bound H - NS in LT2 were not affected by the deletion of hns , probably reflecting the absence of positive regulatory proteins in our culture conditions ( exponential - growth in LB ) .
We hypothesise that these 422 binding sites are important for the nucleoid structuring role of H - NS .
Of the 1,699 genes that were bound by either H - NS or RNAP in wild - type S. typhimurium , only 12 were bound by both proteins .
This suggests that repression by H - NS is generally achieved by preventing the RNA polymerase from binding to target promoter sequences , probably via alterations at the level of DNA topology .
An alternate model of H - NS repression involves looping and trapping of RNA polymerase at the promoter [ 22,23 ] .
This model appears to be contradicted by our data , as we do not observe co - localization of H - NS with the RNA polymerase .
However , it remains possible that the trapping of RNA polymerase is too transient to be detected by our experimental approach .
No consensus DNA sequence has been identified for H - NS binding , but the protein was reported to have a slightly increased affinity for curved DNA around the regulatory region of genes in - vitro [ 7 -- 9 ] .
We therefore correlated H - NS binding with the base - composition and structural features of DNA such as curvature , stacking energy , and protein - induced deformability .
For each oligonucleotide on the microarray , we measured the characteristics of the DNA using the data provided by the Genome Atlas of the S. typhimurium chromosome ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/GenomeAtlas/ info/background.php ) .
The best observed correlation was between H - NS binding and AT - content ( Figure 4 ) .
As expected , analysis of H - NS binding in relation to stacking energy and protein deformability gave very similar profiles to the base composition ( unpublished data ) , as these structural characteristics are largely dependent on AT - content .
The correlation between H - NS binding and DNA - curvature was much smaller ( Figure 4 ) .
Again , we correlated our results with the transcriptomic analysis of strain LT2 and its congenic hnsdeletion mutant JH4000 .
Base composition was confirmed to play an important role for H - NS as a repressor of gene expression , because AT - rich genes were 20 times more likely to be repressed by H - NS than GC - rich genes .
In contrast , genes with a strong curved DNA sequence in their regulatory regions were only two times more likely to be repressed by H - NS , compared to genes with low or no curvature .
Promoter regions are usually associated with both higher AT - content and curvature of DNA .
However , not all bacterial PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 0748 August 2006  Volume 2  Issue 8  e81 Genome - Wide Silencing in Salmonella Figure 3 .

The boundaries of SPI1 and SPI2 were defined from the Horizontal Gene Transfer Database http://www.tinet.org/;debb/HGT [ 25 ] .
promoters are regulated by H - NS invoking a requirement for binding specificity .
We therefore investigated whether genes bound by H - NS displayed a particular topological or DNA sequence profile around their putative regulatory regions .
We determined whether the average AT - content and curvature surrounding the translational start for the 746 H - NS - bound genes was different to the profile for all S. typhimurium genes .
The genes bound by H - NS displayed higher AT - content and curvature throughout the entire length of their regulatory and structural regions ( Figure 4C and 4D ) .
No particular position in the DNA segment displayed a particular type of topology , relative to the translational start .
A similar result was obtained for the 254 genes that are both bound by H - NS and de - repressed in JH4000 ( unpublished data ) .
Our data show no requirement for a particularly AT - rich or curved DNA - segment that acts as an H - NS binding site to be positioned at any particular location relative to the promoter region .
This corresponds to findings at the proU and hdeA promoters , showing that the H - NS binding site can be placed at various distances from the transcriptional start without affecting repression by H - NS [ 9,22 ] .
The results also fit a model where H - NS must bind to regulatory regions at several locations to repress expression .
As genes acquired by Salmonella through lateral gene transfer are characterised by their high AT - content [ 24 ] , we investigated whether H - NS showed increased affinity for islands of foreign DNA .
We found a strong preference ( p ,1 3 10 55 ) for H - NS to bind DNA predicted to have recently entered the S. typhimurium genome ; H - NS bound 42 % of genes that have been acquired by lateral gene transfer [ 25 ] .
Our data show that H - NS binds to DNA regions that extend throughout entire pathogenicity islands ( Figure 3D and 3E ) .
Previous studies have shown that H - NS represses the expression of virulence genes present on pathogenicity PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 0749 August 2006  Volume 2  Issue 8  e81 Genome - Wide Silencing in Salmonella Figure 4 .
Correlation between AT - Content , Curvature and H - NS , and RNAP Binding to DNA For each oligonucleotide on the microarrays we calculated its average AT - content ( A ) and curvature ( B ) .
To minimize bias that might have been introduced by the algorithms used to design the oligonucleotides , flanking sequences ( 50 bp ) of the oligonucleotides were included in the analysis .
The results of each oligonucleotide were plotted against the level of H - NS binding ( grey circles ) .
Window - averaged results ( window size : 101 ) are also shown ( solid line ) .
( C and D ) AT - content and curvature profiles were calculated from putative promoter sequences aligned by over - laying every S. typhimurium gene at the translational start .
The profiles have been calculated for all the S. typhimurium genes ( black ) , and for those subsets of genes bound by H - NS ( green ) or RNAP ( red ) .
H - NS Confers a Growth Advantage for Wild - Type Salmonella by Silencing Genes Acquired through Lateral Gene Transfer The growth of the five S. typhimurium strains were followed in LB , as described in Materials and Methods .
The data shown are representative of three experiments , and discussed in the text .
islands and plasmids in various Gram - negative bacteria , including Salmonella , Shigella , E. coli , and Vibrio [ 2,3,26,27 ] .
Now we have determined that H - NS acts as a selective silencer based on AT - content .
However , as H - NS does not bind to all AT - rich genes , cellular factors such as other nucleoid associated proteins might modulate H - NS - binding to particular locations on the genome .
Interestingly , our data do not show preferential binding of H - NS to other mobile elements such as prophages .
This can be explained by the fact that the four prophages present in the S. typhimurium LT2 genome do not display an AT - content higher than the genome average .
We hypothesised that the binding of H - NS to Salmonella pathogenicity islands would have biological significance if it caused silencing of large regions of horizontally - acquired DNA .
Therefore , we compared the fitness of a strain unable to express the Salmonella pathogenicity island , SPI2 in both an hns and hns þ background .
We discovered that the absence of expression of SPI2 in the strain lacking H - NS substantially improved the growth - rate of Salmonella ( Figure 5 ) .
The S. typhimurium strain JH4000 displays a severely reduced growthrate caused by the hns deletion ; the growth - rate ( lmax ) of the PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 0750 August 2006  Volume 2  Issue 8  e81 Genome - Wide Silencing in Salmonella LT2 wild - type strain was 1.45 , twice as fast as the JH4000 hnsdeletion mutant ( lmax 1/4 0.72 ) .
The fitness defect was partially compensated in strain JH4000DssrA , which is unable to express genes coded within the SPI2 island ; deletion of ssrA from JH4000 caused the growth - rate to significantly increase ( p ,0.05 ) .
In contrast , the absence of SPI2 expression in an hns þ background did not affect growth - rate ( strain LT2ssrA ) .
It has been reported that a S. typhimurium hns mutation was associated with compensatory mutations in the phoP and rpoS genes [ 28 ] .
It should be noted that wild - type S. typhimurium strain LT2 already carries a well - characterised point mutation in rpoS which modifies the translation initiation codon , causing decreased translation of RpoS [ 29,30 ] .
To prove that the effect on growth - rate was indeed caused by deletion of the ssrA gene we ruled out the possibility of secondary mutations by complementing JH4000ssrA with plasmid pWSK29ssrAB .
The plasmid caused a significant decrease in growth - rate of JH4000 DssrA ( p ,0.05 ) .
Our data reveal that H - NS offers a fitness advantage to wild - type Salmonella by silencing the expression of foreign DNA under appropriate conditions .
It appears that some pathogenicity islands have acquired the ability to resist H - NSmediated silencing ; the locus of enterocyte effacement ( LEE ) pathogenicity island of enteropathogenic E. coli codes for Ler , an H - NS homologue that can displace H - NS from the LEE regulatory regions [ 31 ] .
In summary , we have discovered that global gene silencing occurs in bacteria , and is mediated by H - NS , which acts on at least 254 S. typhimurium genes .
Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the silencing of specific promoters by H - NS .
For example , at the ilvIH - leuO - leuABCD gene cluster of S. typhimurium , H - NS is initially thought to bind an AT - rich curved DNA sequence which acts as a nucleation site and subsequently forms an extended nucleoprotein complex [ 12 ] .
We suggest that this type of nucleoprotein complex is responsible for H - NS - mediated gene silencing , and are investigating the co - operative binding of H - NS at other chromosomal regions in S. typhimurium .
Our observation that H - NS and RNA polymerase rarely co - localize during exponential growth indicates that H - NS generally prevents gene expression by excluding RNA polymerase from binding to DNA , rather than by trapping RNA polymerase at promoters .
It is possible that such trapping by H - NS may occur in stationary - phase bacteria , when a lower number of RNA polymerase molecules is required for active transcription .
After this manuscript was submitted , a related study was published by Navarre et al [ 28 ] .
The authors used an analogous approach to detect H - NS binding sites in S. typhimurium strain 14028 and also concluded that H - NS preferentially binds to AT - rich genes .
Taken together , these two studies give confidence about the phenomenon of global gene silencing in bacteria ; the H - NS protein was found to bind to AT - rich genes in two different S. typhimurium strains ( 14028 and LT2 ) grown in two distinct media ( minimal medium versus LB ) .
Taken together , our findings prove that H - NS has a strong preference for AT - rich DNA which facilitates binding to a large number of genes acquired through lateral gene transfer .
We know that bacterial evolution relies upon the ability of newly acquired genes to offer a selective advantage to their host [ 32 ] .
However , the expression of genes encoded by novel DNA must be controlled or the cell will suffer negative consequences .
We have shown that H - NS is essential for the prevention of decreased fitness associated with uncontrolled expression of pathogenicity island genes .
The evolutionary implications of this silencing function of a nucleoid -- associated protein merit further study in many enterobacterial pathogens .
Materials and Methods Bacterial strains and growth - conditions .
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 and its hns derivative JH4000 were described in our recent transcriptomic study [ 2 ] .
Where necessary , antibiotics were used as appropriate at the following concentrations : ampicillin ( 100 lg/ml ) , chloramphenicol ( 12.5 lg/ml ) .
To measure growth - rates , overnight cultures were subcultured 100 - fold into 25 ml fresh LB - broth [ 33 ] and grown in 250 - ml flasks in a 37 8C waterbath ( Innova 3100 , New Brunswick Scientific , Edison , New Jersey , United States ) at 250 rpm .
Strain construction and DNA manipulation .
The DssrA deletion derivative of S. typhimurium LT2 ( LT2ssrA ) was generated using the k Red method [ 34 ] .
The oligonucleotides used for this construction were ssrARedF 59GTGCCAAAGATTTTGCAACAGGCAACT - GGAGGGAAGCATTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC - 39 and ssraRedR 59 - ATTCTTTCATTTTGCTGCCCTCGCGAAAATTA AGATAA - TACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG - 39 , in conjunction with template plasmid pKD4 .
The DssrA deletion mutation was marked with the Kan antibiotic resistance cassette .
After mutagenesis , the mutation was P22 - transduced to a clean background using phage P22 HT105/1 int - 201 .
EBU plates were used to select for non - lysogens [ 35 ] .
The mutation was verified by PCR using primers external to the mutation .
The DhnsDssrA double mutant of S. typhimurium LT2 ( JH4000ssrA ) was obtained by transducing the DssrA mutation into JH4000 .
Design of a S. typhimurium tiled microarray .
The microarrays used in this study were designed and produced by Oxford Gene Technology ( Kidlington , Oxfordshire , United Kingdom ) .
The microarrays consisted of 21,340 60 - mer oligonucleotides tiled throughout the S. typhimurium LT2 chromosome and does not cover the pSLT plasmid .
The gap between oligonucleotides averaged 170 bp .
Cultures of S. typhimurium LT2 were grown in LB broth with aeration ( 37 8C , 250 rpm ) in an Innova 3100 waterbath ( New Brunswick Scientific ) until OD 600 1/4 0.6 ( early - exponential phase ) , at which point formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1 % ( v/v ) .
After 20 min incubation at 37 8C , the cross - linking reaction was quenched by adding glycine to a 0.5 M final concentration .
Cells were harvested and washed twice in TBS .
The cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris [ pH 8.0 ] , 20 % [ w/v ] sucrose , 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM EDTA [ pH 8.0 ] , 20 mg/ml lysozyme , 0.1 mg/ml RNAseA ) and incubated for 1 h at 37 8C .
Bead beating ( 3 3 20 - s cycles , power 6 [ FastPrep FP120 , Savant , Farmingdale , New York , United States ] ) was used to achieve complete lysis .
The cell lysate was then added to 4 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer ( 50 mM HEPES - KOH [ pH 7.5 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % [ v/v ] Triton X - 100 , 0.1 % [ w/v ] sodium deoxycholate , 0.1 % [ w/v ] SDS , 1 mM PMSF ) .
Three aliquots ( 800 ll ) were sonicated ( 3 3 20 - s cycles at 10 lm amplitude , ( MSE Soniprep 150 , Sanyo Scientific , Bensenville , Illinois , United States ) to solubilize the chromatin .
Chromatin immuno - precipitation was then performed as described by Grainger et al [ 18 ] on two aliquots , using monoclonal H113 anti - H-NS antibodies [ 36 ] or anti - RNA polymerase - b subunit monoclonal antibodies ( Neoclone , Madison , Wisconsin , United States ) .
As a negative control , chromatin immuno - precipitation was done on the third aliquot without the addition of any antibodies .
Additional control chromatin immuno - precipitations were performed using polyclonal H200 anti - H-NS antibodies [ 36 ] .
The DNA obtained from chromatin immuno - precipitation was labelled with Cy5 , mixed with a reference ( Cy3 - labelled S. typhimurium LT2 genomic DNA ) and hybridized against the S. typhimurium LT2 tiled oligonucleotide microarray .
The protocol used to label both types of DNA samples is described at http://www.ifr.bbsrc.ac.uk/safety/ microarrays/protocols.html .
The hybridization procedure is described by Grainger et al [ 37 ] .
The experiment was performed with three independent biological replicates .
Data acquisition and analysis .
The microarray slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner ( Axon Instruments , Union City , California , United States ) .
Spot intensities were quantified using BlueFuse software ( BlueGnome , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) .
Data analysis and visualization was performed using GeneSpring GX 7.3 ( Agilent , Palo Alto , California , United States ) .
To compensate for unequal dye incorporation and/or differences in background levels PLoS Pathogens  www.plospathogens.org 0751 August 2006  Volume 2  Issue 8  e81 Genome - Wide Silencing in Salmonella caused by the ChIP procedure , data centering was performed by bringing the median Ln ( Red/Green ) to zero .
To determine the level of binding of H - NS or RNA polymerase - b subunit ( the enrichment factor ) , results were normalized to the ratios obtained for the negative control ( ChIP - on - chip performed without antibodies ) .
To identify regions of H - NS and RNAP binding , we only considered oligonucleotides that displayed enrichment factors 1.5 and 2 for RNAP and H - NS data , respectively , in all three biological replicates .
The enrichment factor cut - off of 2 was chosen to reflect the higher variability observed in the H - NS ChIP data .
We then retained those signals extending to two or more adjacent oligonucleotides on the genome ; the rationale being that since the ChIP procedure generates DNA fragments 500 -- 1,000 bp in length , we did not expect peaks of H - NS and RNAP binding to correspond to isolated oligonucleotides .
