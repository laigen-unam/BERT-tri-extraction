Slauch 1,2 * Department of Microbiology 1 and College of Medicine , 2 University of Illinois , Urbana , Illinois 61801 A prerequisite for Salmonella enterica to cause both intestinal and systemic disease is the direct injection of effector proteins into host intestinal epithelial cells via a type three secretion system ( T3SS ) ; the T3SS genes are carried on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) .
These effector proteins induce inflammatory diarrhea and bacterial invasion .
Expression of the SPI1 T3SS is tightly regulated in response to environmental signals through a variety of global regulatory systems .
We have previously shown that three AraC - like regulators , HilD , HilC , and RtsA , act in a complex feed - forward regulatory loop to control the expression of the hilA gene , which encodes the direct regulator of the SPI1 structural genes .
In this work , we characterize a major positive regulator of this system , the flagellar protein FliZ .
Through genetic and biochemical analyses , we show that FliZ posttranslationally controls HilD to positively regulate hilA expression .
This mechanism is independent of other flagellar components and is not mediated through the negative regulator HilE or through FliZmediated RpoS regulation .
We demonstrate that FliZ controls HilD protein activity and not stability .
FliZ regulates HilD in the absence of Lon protease , previously shown to degrade HilD .
Indeed , it appears that FliZ , rather than HilD , is the most relevant target of Lon as it relates to SPI1 expression .
Mutants lacking FliZ are significantly attenuated in their ability to colonize the intestine but are unaffected during systemic infection .
The intestinal attenuation is partially dependent on SPI1 , but FliZ has additional pleiotropic effects .
During the course of infection , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium induces inflammatory diarrhea and invades intestinal epithelial cells using a type three secretion system ( T3SS ) ; the T3SS genes are carried on Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) ( 20 , 51 , 53 , 55 ) .
The SPI1 locus is a 40 - kb island and carries all of the genes for a functional T3SS apparatus , a number of secreted effectors , and the regulatory proteins HilA , HilC , and HilD ( 34 ) .
RtsA , homologous to HilD and HilC , is encoded on a 15 - kb island inserted in the tRNA PheU gene ( 15 ) .
HilA is the master SPI1 regulator and directly binds to the promoters and activates expression of the prg - org and inv - spa operons , encoding the components of the apparatus ( 2 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 32 ) .
The expression of hilA is controlled by a complex feed - forward regulatory loop consisting of HilD , HilC , and RtsA , each of which can independently activate hilA expression ( 13 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
Of these three , HilD has the predominant role , but apparently , it alone can not activate SPI1 sufficiently in - vivo ( 13 ) .
HilC and RtsA act as amplifiers of the inducing signals .
A number of additional regulatory systems also affect SPI1 regulation ( 1 , 17 ) .
Most of these systems seem to act through HilD ( 18 ) , suggesting that HilD is the integration point for signal transduction into the SPI1 system .

RtsA , HilD , and HilC directly activate dsbA , which encodes a periplasmic disulfide bond oxidoreductase ( 16 ) .
Loss of DsbA independently affects SPI1 regulation and SPI1 function ( 30 ) .
The dsbA - mediated regulation of SPI1 expression is indirect , caused by decreased expression of the flagellar protein FliZ , which had previously been implicated in SPI1 regulation ( 12 , 25 , 33 ) .
Our analysis indicates that the decrease in disulfide bond formation in the periplasm , caused by loss of DsbA , both prevents formation of a functional flagellar apparatus and activates the RcsCDB phosphorelay system , which represses the master flagellar regulatory genes flhDC .
The combination of these effects results in a significant decrease in FliZ production , thereby affecting expression of the SPI1 system ( 30 ) .
Indeed , hilA expression largely mirrors fliZ expression under a variety of conditions ( 30 ) .
FliZ is encoded by a gene in the fliA operon , and orthologs are found only in the flagellar regulons of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae .
The mechanism of action of FliZ is unknown .
It has been reported to enhance class II flagellar gene expression ( 24 ) , with evidence suggesting that it posttranslationally regulates FlhD 4 C 2 in Salmonella ( 39 ) .
In addition , Escherichia coli FliZ can act as a posttranslational inhibitor of RpoS , and as a consequence , interfere with curli fimbria formation ( 37 ) .
Despite its apparent posttranslational effects in Salmonella and E. coli , the FliZ protein contains a region that resembles the core DNA binding domain of phage integrases ( 49 ) .
Indeed , in Xenorhabdus nematophila , FliZ activates transcription of class II flagellar genes by binding directly to the flhDC promoter ( 29 ) .
We previously showed that FliZ - mediated induction of hilA expression is through HilD ( 30 ) .

Model for the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) regulatory network .
The expression of hilA , the master regulator for SPI1 , is controlled by HilD , HilC , and RtsA , which act in a complex feed - forward loop .
Each can independently activate expression of their own gene as well as each other and hilA .
Signals are integrated by HilD ; HilC and RtsA act as amplifiers of those signals .
For clarity , the genes encoding HilD , HilC , RtsA , and HilA are not shown .
The solid arrows indicate direct gene activation .
T3SS , type three secretion system .
recently shown that FliZ controls SPI1 expression by affecting HilD at the posttranscriptional level ( 26 ) .
It was implied that FliZ somehow controls HilD translation , although no direct evidence was given .
In this work , we further characterize the mechanism of FliZ regulation of HilD .
Here we show that FliZ regulates HilD activity at the level of HilD protein .
Our data also indicated that FliZ is critical in - vivo for colonization or invasion of the intestine but is dispensable during systemic infection .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Media , reagents , and enzymatic assays .
Strains were routinely grown in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium at 37 °C except for strains containing the temperaturesensitive plasmid pKD46 or pCP20 , which were grown at 30 °C .
Strains were grown under Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) - inducing conditions , which are defined as high - osmolarity LB - medium ( 1 % NaCl ) in standing cultures ( low oxygen ) for 18 to 22 h. Under non - SPI1 - inducing conditions , cells were grown in low - salt LB - medium ( 0.5 % NaCl ) at 37 °C with shaking .
The antibiotics and concentrations used were as follows : ampicillin , 50 g/ml ; chloramphenicol , 20 g/ml ; kanamycin , 50 g/ml ; tetracycline , 0.1 , 0.4 , and 0.8 g/ml ; streptomycin , 200 g/ml ; spectinomycin , 50 g/ml ; and rifampin , 100 g/ml .
Primers were ordered from IDT .
Antibodies were purchased from Sigma ( monoclonal anti- FLAG M2 ) or Biomeda ( goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase [ HRP ] ) .
- Galactosidase assays were performed using a microtiter plate assay as previously described ( 44 ) .
In most cases , cultures were grown aerobically overnight in low - salt LB - medium ( 0.5 % NaCl ) , subcultured 1:100 in 3 ml of high - salt LB medium ( 1 % NaCl ) , and allowed to grow standing in 13 - mm test tubes for 18 to 22 h .
If needed , ampicillin ( 50 g/ml ) was added to the high - salt LB - medium for plasmid maintenance , or the indicated amount of tetracycline was added for specific gene induction .
- Galactosidase activity units are defined as ( micromoles of ortho - nitrophenol [ ONP ] formed per minute 10 3 ) / ( OD 600 milliliter of cell suspension ) ( OD 600 is the optical density at 600 nm ) and are reported as means standard deviations .
Construction of strains and plasmids .
All strains are isogenic derivatives of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 and are listed in Table 1 .
Gene deletions and concomitant insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette were constructed using lambda Red - mediated recombination as described previously ( 9 , 14 ) .
All constructs were verified by PCR and moved into a clean background via P22HTint105 phage transduction .
In some cases , the antibiotic resistance cassette was removed by FLP - mediated recombination with introduction of pCP20 ( 6 ) .
Transcriptional and translational lac fusions to hilD were constructed by FLP - mediated integration of fusion plasmids as described previously ( 14 ) .
FLAG - tagged HilD and FliZ alleles were constructed as described previously ( 52 ) .
To make plasmid pFliZ , the fliZ gene , corresponding to base pairs 14 to 571 relative to the start site of translation , was amplified using primers carrying EcoRI ( 5 ) and BamHI ( 3 ) sites and then cloned into vector pWKS30 ( 54 ) .
HilD stability assays and Western blot analysis .
To determine HilD levels in cells in stationary - phase , bacteria were grown with shaking in low - salt LB - medium ( 0.5 % NaCl ) until they reached stationary - phase , then subcultured 1:100 in 90 ml of high - salt LB - medium ( 1 % NaCl ) containing 100 g/ml ampicillin and 0.4 g/ml tetracycline ( to induce hilD ) , and grown for 18 to 22 h standing at 37 °C .
One milliliter of each culture was used to determine the - galactosidase activity produced from the hilA - lacZ fusion .
The remaining cells were centrifuged , and the cell pellet was washed and suspended in 1 ml of phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) .
The OD 600 of each sample was measured , and the volume was adjusted to ensure that equal concentrations of cells were used .
The cells were disrupted by passing twice through a French pressure cell at 4 °C .
A 1/5 volume of 5 sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) loading buffer ( 43 ) and - mercaptoethanol ( final concentration of 5 % ) were added to an aliquot of each , and these samples were boiled for 5 min .
Proteins were separated on 10 % discontinuous SDS - polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond ECL membranes ( Amersham ) .
The blots were blocked with 5 % nonfat dried milk in PBS , exposed to monoclonal anti- FLAG M2 antibody , and HRP - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG .
The Western blot procedure and the detection of HRP - conjugated antibodies with a chemiluminescence system were performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Amersham ) .
For log - phase assays , cells were grown in low - salt LB - medium with shaking until the cells reached stationary - phase , and then they were subcultured 1:100 in 10 ml of low - salt LB - medium containing 0.8 g/ml tetracycline .
Cultures were grown shaking for 2.5 h at 37 °C .
After 2.5 h , the OD 600 of each sample was measured , and the volume was adjusted to ensure equal concentrations of cells .
One - milliliter samples were then removed to perform - galactosidase assays .
Concurrently , a transcription/translation inhibition cocktail containing 100 g/ml rifampin , 200 g/ml streptomycin , and 50 g/ml spectinomycin were added to each culture ( considered time zero ) .
At appropriate intervals , 24 - l aliquots were removed from each culture and immediately mixed with 7.5 l of5 SDS loading buffer with - mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min .
SDS - PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed on the samples as described above .
The intensity of bands was analyzed with ImageJ software ( NIH ) , allowing half - lives to be determined .
The mean half - life standard error of the mean ( SEM ) was calculated from 2 or 3 replicates for each strain .
To detect FLAG - tagged FliZ , 1 - ml LB cultures of each strain were grown to saturation .
Each was subcultured 1:100 in 40 ml of high - salt LB - medium ( 1 % NaCl ) and grown standing at 37 °C .
The OD 600 of each culture was determined at 18 h , and volumes were adjusted slightly to ensure equal concentrations of cells .
Forty milliliters of each culture was centrifuged , and the resulting cell pellet was washed and suspended in 1 ml PBS with 0.5 % Tween 20 ( PBST ) .
Cells were disrupted by passing twice through a French pressure cell .
Each lysate was incubated with anti - FLAG Sepharose beads overnight .
The beads were pelleted by centrifugation , washed six times with PBST , and then boiled in 50 l of1 SDS loading buffer with 5 % - mercaptoethanol .
The samples were centrifuged to remove the beads .
SDS - PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed as described above .
BALB/c mice ( Harlan ) ( 6 to 8 weeks old ) were inoculated either orally or intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) with 0.2 ml of a bacterial suspension .
For oral infections , the cells were washed and suspended at 5 10 7 or 5 10 9 cells per ml in sterile 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 8.0 .
For intraperitoneal infections , the cells were diluted to 5 10 3 cells per ml in sterile 0.15 M NaCl .
Between 3 and 5 days after infection , the mice were sacrificed by CO 2 asphyxiation , and the ileal small intestines and spleens were harvested from mice inoculated orally and mice inoculated i.p. , respectively .
These organs were homogenized , and serial dilutions were plated on the appropriate medium to determine the number of CFU per organ .
The relative percentage of each strain recovered was determined by replica plating to the appropriate antibiotic - containing medium .
In all competition assays , the inoculum consisted of a 1:1 mix of two bacterial strains .
The actual CFU and relative percentage represented by each strain was determined by direct plating of the inoculum .
The competitive index ( CI ) was calculated as ( percentage of strain A recovered/percentage of strain B recovered ) / ( percentage of strain A inoculated/percentage of strain B inoculated ) .
Each mutant strain was reconstructed at least once to ensure that the virulence phenotype was the result of the designated mutation ( s ) .
The Student t test was used to determine whether the output ratio was significantly different from the input ratio .
All animal work was reviewed and approved by the VOL .

RESULTS FliZ activates hilA through HilD , independent of FlhDC .
We have previously shown that FliZ is a positive regulator of hilA expression ( 30 ) .
To further understand the mechanism of this regulation , we examined expression of a hilA - lacZ transcriptional fusion in various mutant backgrounds .
Deletion of fliZ or flhDC , encoding the master transcriptional activator of the flagellar regulon , including fliZ , caused a 4 - fold decrease in hilA expression ( Fig. 2A ) .
Overproduction of FliZ from a plasmid led to a 5 - fold increase in hilA transcription .
Importantly , ectopic expression of FliZ activates hilA expression in strains with flhDC deleted ( Fig. 2B ) .
Therefore , the SPI1 regulatory FIG. 2 .
FliZ activates hilA through hilD .
- Galactosidase ( - Gal ) activity was examined in strains containing hilA - lacZ transcriptional fusions and the indicated plasmids and/or mutations .
The strains were grown under SPI1 - inducing conditions .
- Galactosidase activity units are defined as ( micromoles of ONP formed per minute 10 3 ) / ( OD 600 milliliter of cell suspension ) and are reported as means standard deviations ( error bars ) for four replicate samples relative to the results for the wild - type ( WT ) strain .
The strains used were JS749 , JS778 , JS946 , JS798 to JS807 , JS947 , and JS948 .
circuit is responding to FliZ , not flagella per se , and FliZ acts independently of any other flagellar protein .
To determine where FliZ fits into our model of SPI1 regulation , we also reexamined the effects of deleting hilD , hilC , and rtsA on expression of a hilA - lacZ fusion while overexpressing FliZ ( Fig. 2B ) .
Introduction of a hilD deletion into the hilA - lacZ fusion strain resulted in the expected decrease in hilA expression .
Moreover , overproduction of FliZ no longer activated hilA in the hilD background .
In contrast , neither RtsA nor HilC was required for FliZ induction of hilA expression , although the absolute level of expression was reduced in both mutants , consistent with our model of SPI1 regulation ( Fig. 1 ) .
These data are consistent with our previous results ( 30 ) and provide genetic evidence that HilD is required for FliZ - mediated regulation of hilA ; RtsA and HilC act as amplifiers of the signal .
Further analysis showed that loss of FliZ also had no effect in a hilD null background ( Fig. 3A ) .
These data also suggest that FliZ functions through HilD .
However , the level of hilA expression is low in the hilD background .
Therefore , it remained possible that FliZ functions at some step downstream of HilD action , for example at the hilA promoter , but that this regulation is not evident in the hilD null background .
To distinguish whether FliZ regulates hilA via HilD or independently of HilD , we put rtsA under the control of a tetracycline - inducible promoter ( tetRA - rtsA ) .
This construct allows us to turn on hilA ( and hilC ) even in the absence of HilD ( 13 ) .
RtsA , HilC , and HilD each activate hilA by binding to the same sites in the promoter region ( 13 , 35 , 36 ) .
If FliZ affects hilA expression solely through HilD , then there should be no fliZ phenotype in a hilD background when the system is activated by other means .
In hilD strains in which rtsA is controlled by a tetracycline - inducible promoter ( Fig. 3B ) , FliZ - dependent regulation was evident in the absence of tetracycline .
This condition is equivalent to an rtsA null mutation .

background conferred low - level expression .
The addition of tetracycline induced hilA expression in this hilD null background .
Indeed , with 1 g/ml tetracycline , hilA expression was similar to that observed in a wild - type background under SPI1 - inducing conditions ( compare Fig. 3B to Fig. 3A ) .
However , the loss of FliZ had no significant effect under these conditions .
These results are consistent with our model that FliZ is functioning through HilD to control hilA expression .
Note that in the hilD background , the addition of tetracycline led to a significant increase in hilA expression , as expected .
Moreover , there was an apparent loss of FliZ - dependent regulation at increasing concentrations of tetracycline .
Thus , overproduction of HilD confers FliZ - independent activation of hilA .
This loss of regulation is also evident when HilD is overproduced by other methods ( not shown ) .
FliZ regulates HilD posttranslationally .
Given that HilD is required for FliZ regulation of hilA , it seemed possible that FliZ could regulate hilD transcription or translation .
To test this hypothesis , we examined the effects of FliZ on expression of hilD - lacZ - fusions .
Importantly , these hilD fusion constructs are hilD null so that we can examine regulation in the absence of autoactivation by HilD .
Figure 4A shows that overproduction of FliZ had no effect on either a transcriptional or translational lacZ fusion to hilD .
In contrast , overproduction of HilC activates transcription of these fusions as expected ; HilC FIG. 4 .
FliZ acts at the level of HilD protein .
( A ) - Galactosidase activity in strains containing either a hilD - lacZ transcriptional or translational fusion and the indicated plasmids .
The fusion joints of the two constructs are identical ( 14 ) .
The strains were grown under SPI1 - inducing conditions with 10 mM arabinose .
Arabinose is required for induction of pHilC but was included in all cultures .
The strains used were JS883 , JS957 , JS958 , JS892 , JS959 , and JS960 .
( B ) - Galactosidase activity in strains containing a hilA - lacZ - transcriptional - fusion and the indicated mutations .
The strains were grown under SPI1 - inducing conditions ( left panel ) or in LB - medium ( 0.5 % NaCl ) with the indicated tetracycline concentrations and with shaking ( right panel ) .
The strains used were JS749 , JS778 , JS633 , JS961 , JS962 , and JS963 .

is known to independently activate hilD transcription ( 13 ) .
These data show that FliZ does not act by controlling hilD transcription .
Moreover , the fact that a hilD translational fusion was not affected by FliZ shows that FliZ regulation is not mediated at the level of translation initiation .
Thus , FliZ - mediated regulation of HilD is posttranslational .
FliZ acts at the level of HilD protein .
The data above suggest that FliZ regulates HilD function posttranslationally .
The system is complicated by the fact that HilD is autoregulated and hilD transcription is normally induced upon activation of the regulatory circuit ( 13 ) .
Thus , in order to determine whether regulation works at the level of HilD protein , we had to place hilD transcription under a different promoter .
To accomplish this , we inserted a tetracycline resistance cassette in place of the normal hilD promoter , placing transcription of hilD under tetracycline control .
This construct was introduced into a strain containing a hilA - lacZ - transcriptional - fusion .
Starting with this background , we deleted fliZ or hilE and examined expression of the hilA - lacZ fusion .
In the control strains with hilD under its own promoter , deletion of fliZ resulted in a 6 - to 7 - fold decrease in hilA expression ( Fig. 4B ) .
HilE inhibits HilD function by direct protein - protein interaction as suggested by two - hybrid analysis ( 3 ) and coimmunoprecipitation ( J. E. C. Chubiz and J. M. Slauch , unpublished data ) .
As expected , deletion of HilE resulted in a 5 - fold increase in expression .
In the TetR - controlled hilD background , without the addition of tetracycline , hilA expression was low and deletion of fliZ or hilE had little effect ; these strains behave essentially as hilD null mutants .
The addition of 0.1 g/ml tetracycline resulted in hilA expression comparable to expression in the hilD background .
Deletion of hilE under these conditions conferred a 2.6 - fold in - 6266 CHUBIZ ET AL. .
FliZ regulates hilA independently of HilE and RpoS .

crease in hilA expression .
Deletion of fliZ resulted in a 4.7 - fold decrease in hilA expression .
The fact that these proteins control an ectopically expressed HilD suggests that both HilE and FliZ control HilD activity at the level of HilD protein .
Note that the level of regulation was not as robust as that seen in the wild - type background .
This is as expected , given that these signals are no longer amplified by transcriptional activation of the hilD promoter .
FliZ acts independently of HilE .
One model that would explain FliZ posttranslational regulation of HilD is that FliZ could negatively regulate HilE expression or function .
To test this hypothesis , we examined the effects of hilE and fliZ deletions on hilA expression .
If FliZ works through hilE , a deletion of fliZ would have no effect on the expression of hilA in the hilE background .
Figure 5A shows that while a deletion of hilE increased expression of hilA as expected , a deletion of fliZ in the hilE background was still able to decrease hilA expression about 4.5 - fold .
As expected , deletion of hilD completely blocked both HilE - and FliZ - mediated regulation .
In contrast , deletion of hilC or rtsA has little effect on regulation by HilE or FliZ .
Thus , while both HilE and FliZ act through HilD , the effects of FliZ are the same in wild - type and hilE backgrounds , indicating that these two factors regulate HilD independently of each other .
FliZ independently regulates RpoS and HilD .
It has recently been shown that in E. coli , FliZ negatively regulates RpoS activity posttranslationally , independent of other flagellar proteins ( 37 ) .
While RpoS has never been shown to affect SPI1 expression in Salmonella , these results raised the possibility that FliZ could be working through RpoS to control HilD activity .
This hypothesis was tested , and the results are shown in Fig. 5B .
Deletion of rpoS had no effect on expression of a hilA - lacZ fusion under SPI1 - inducing conditions .
Moreover , overexpression of FliZ activated hilA even in the rpoS deletion strain .
For controls for this experiment , we examined the expression of two known RpoS - regulated genes , katE ( 23 ) and sodCII ( 21 ) .
In both cases , deletion of rpoS significantly decreased expression of these genes as expected .
Interestingly , overproduction of FliZ also decreased expression of both genes .
This FliZ - mediated decrease was not seen in the rpoS deletion background .
These data show that FliZ does affect RpoS - mediated activation in Salmonella but that FliZ - mediated regulation of SPI1 is independent of RpoS .
FliZ affects the function of HilD ; its effects on HilD stability are secondary .
We next examined HilD protein levels in response to FliZ - or HilE - mediated regulation .
We constructed a3 FLAG - tagged version of HilD and proved that this tagged version was functional ( see Fig .
S1 in the supplemental material ) .
We then placed FLAG - tagged hilD under the control of the tetracycline - inducible promoter as described above .
The strain also contained a hilA - lacZ - transcriptional - fusion .
Starting with this background , we deleted fliZ and then introduced a vector control or pFliZ ( fliZ null versus FliZ overproduction ) , or we deleted hilE and introduced a vector control or pHilE ( hilE null versus HilE overproduction ) .
The fliZ hilE strain containing the vector was included as a control .
We grew the strains in SPI1 - inducing conditions with the addition of tetracycline .
We used part of the culture to determine the - galactosidase activity produced from the hilA - lacZ fusion .
We monitored the levels of the FLAG - tagged HilD protein in the remaining cells by Western blot analysis .
Our results are shown in Fig. 6A .
The - galactosidase activity produced from the hilA - lacZ fusion showed clear regulation by FliZ and HilE .
However , there was no strict correlation between the level of HilD protein and the level of hilA expression ; HilD protein levels in the fliZ and pFliZ backgrounds differed by only 2 - fold , whereas hilA transcription differed by 10 - fold .
HilD levels were altered significantly in the hilE null background versus pHilE background .
However , while the levels of HilD in the strain carrying pHilE were essentially equal to those in the wild - type strain , activity was markedly reduced .
The effects of HilE on HilD levels will require further analysis .
However , these results do suggest that FliZ controls some aspect of HilD activity per se and suggest that subtle differences in steady - state levels are a secondary effect .
To better understand the action of FliZ on HilD , we monitored HilD stability during log - phase growth .
Using the same strains as in the stationary - phase experiment above , we induced hilD transcription with - tetracycline and aerated the cells until they reached late log phase .
Then , transcription and translation were stopped by the addition of rifampin , streptomycin , and spectinomycin , and samples were removed every 15 min to monitor the level of HilD over time via Western blot analysis .
An aliquot of each sample was also removed at time VOL .

The amounts of HilD present at time zero were nearly identical in each case .
The half - life of HilD protein in a wildtype background was approximately 30 min .
Loss of FliZ actually increased HilD half - life slightly .
Overproduction of FliZ increased HilD half - life even further .
In all cases , the half - life of HilD is longer than the doubling time of the cells under FIG. 7 .
FliZ regulates HilD in the absence of Lon protease .
( A ) - Galactosidase activity in strains containing a hilA - lacZ transcriptional fusion and various mutations or pFliZ as indicated .
The strains were grown under SPI1 - inducing conditions .
The strains used were JS749 and JS982 to JS985 .
( B ) Immunoprecipitation of FliZ - 3 FLAG .
Strains produced either wild - type FliZ or 3 FLAG - tagged FliZ as indicated in lon or lon mutant backgrounds .
The cultures were grown under SPI1 - inducing conditions .
FLAG - tagged protein was immunoprecipitated from lysates from equal concentrations and numbers of cells .
The proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis to detect FLAG - tagged protein .
The strains used were 14028 , JS987 , JS988 , and JS989 .
Thus , although the half - life of HilD is slightly affected by changes in FliZ levels , this does not explain the mechanism of regulation .
FliZ regulates HilD independently of Lon .
HilC and HilD were reported to be degraded by the Lon protease , and this presumably contributes to shutting down SPI1 expression after invasion ( 4 , 50 ) .
If FliZ acts by controlling stability , it would likely do so by affecting the accessibility of HilD to Lon .
To test this hypothesis , we performed - galactosidase assays to monitor hilA - lacZ activity in lon mutant backgrounds .
In these experiments , hilD was under the control of its native promoter and the cells were grown under SPI1 - inducing conditions .
The results are shown in Fig. 7A .
Mutants defective in Lon are mucoid due to the production of colanic acid ( 22 ) .
Therefore , the capsule production genes in the wca operon were deleted in order to make the strains easier to work with .
The wca mutation had no effect on hilA expression .
As expected , hilA expression was increased in the lon background .
However , hilA expression in this background was even more significantly affected by FliZ than in the wild type ; activity was decreased about 20 - fold in the absence of FliZ and increased 3 - fold when FliZ was overexpressed .
We then measured the half - life of HilD in a lon background .
This experiment was performed as described above using strains in which hilD expression was under tet control .

c The Student t test was used to compare the CIs to the inocula .
d Bacteria were recovered from the spleen in the case of intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) competition assays .
e Bacteria were recovered from the distal portion of the small intestine in oral competition assays .
B compared a strain lacking FliZ to a strain in which FliZ was being overproduced from the plasmid .
Again , regulation by FliZ was even more robust in the lon mutants ( Fig. 6B , bottom two gels ) .
The concentrations of HilD at time zero were nearly identical in both cases .
Surprisingly , the half - lives of HilD were nearly identical in the two strains and were only slightly longer than the half - life in strains with Lon .
Clearly , FliZ controls HilD activity by a mechanism independent of degradation .
The results above suggest that proteases in addition to Lon are responsible for degradation of HilD .
Nevertheless , in the absence of Lon , hilA expression is increased 4 - fold .
This increase seems to be dependent on FliZ .
We had constructed a 3 Flag - tagged version of FliZ ( FliZ - 3 FLAG ) and shown it to be functional ( albeit less active than the wild - type protein ; see Fig .
S1 in the supplemental material ) .
However , we never detected FLAG - tagged FliZ in a Western blot .
Given our results , we compared the levels of FliZ in lon and lon mutant strains .
Figure 7B shows that we could immunoprecipitate FliZ - 3 FLAG from lon cells , but the protein was not detected in a wild - type background .
Thus , FliZ appears to be stabilized in the absence of Lon .
Taken together , our results suggest that the increased hilA expression seen in the absence of Lon is not due to increased stability of HilD but to increased stability of FliZ .
FliZ contributes to the invasion mechanism of virulence .
The data above show that FliZ significantly affects SPI1 regulation in - vitro , but is FliZ - mediated regulation important during intestinal invasion ?
To test this , we performed oral and intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) competition assays , infecting mice with a 1:1 mix of wild - type and fliZ strains and determining the ratio of the two strains after 3 to 5 days of infection in either the ileal small intestine ( oral ) or spleen ( i.p. ) .
As shown in Table 2 , the fliZ mutant was significantly attenuated compared to the wild type ( 63 - fold ) when recovered from the small intestine after oral infection .
However , the fliZ mutant competed evenly with the wild type after an i.p. infection , suggesting that FliZ has a role primarily during intestinal colonization and/or invasion .
A fliZ mutant was previously shown to be attenuated after oral infection as measured in a time - to - death assay ( 25 ) , and our data are consistent with these findings .
To determine whether the attenuation of the fliZ mutant was due to decreased expression of hilA , we tested the effects of deleting fliZ in a strain in which the entire SPI1 locus was deleted ( 13 ) .
In this background , FliZ still contributed to virulence , but the mutant was attenuated only 5 - fold compared to the isogenic strain .
These data suggest that FliZ plays a pleiotropic role during intestinal colonization and invasion , but at least part of this effect is via SPI1 .
DISCUSSION Salmonella enterica has evolved a complex regulatory network to control the expression of the SPI1 T3SS , critical for initiating both inflammatory diarrhea and systemic infection .
Although this system has been intensely studied for decades and is continuously uncovered as a major target of global Salmonella gene expression , we are just beginning to understand the details of its regulation .
We have used a variety of genetic and biochemical techniques to unravel this very complex network , allowing us to develop a new model for the SPI1 regulatory circuit ( 13 ) .
This model provides insight into many previous studies and explains all of the data amassed on the system thus far .
Here we focus on FliZ , a regulator with a dramatic effect on SPI1 regulation .
Null mutations in fliZ decrease hilA expression approximately 5 - fold , while overproduction of FliZ from a plasmid increases hilA expression about 5 - fold above that of the wild - type strain .
This regulation is clearly mediated through HilD , but FliZ controls neither hilD transcription nor translation initiation .
Moreover , FliZ can affect regulation when HilD protein is expressed ectopically .
These results show that FliZ acts at the level of HilD protein .
Kage et al. ( 26 ) showed that ClpXP protease affects SPI1 expression indirectly by increasing transcription of fliZ .
These investigators showed that FliZ controls HilD protein levels even when hilD is transcribed from a different promoter .
On the basis of this experiment , they implied that FliZ regulates HilD at the level of translation .
Their data are consistent with ours , but we have investigated FliZ - dependent regulation of HilD in more detail and can , therefore , make more precise conclusions .
The stability of HilD protein is affected slightly by the presence or absence of FliZ .
Importantly , this confirms that FliZ is acting at the level of HilD protein , as it is difficult to imagine a mechanism whereby action that does not directly involve the protein could affect stability .
However , it is clear that regulation by FliZ is apparent in the lon background .
There are data suggesting that Lon degrades HilD and HilC ( 4 , 50 ) .
However , our data suggest that the half - life of HilD is only slightly increased in the absence of Lon .
In contrast , we could detect FliZ only in the lon background .
This result and the fact that the increase in hilA expression seen in the lon mutant is VOL .
192 , 2010 FliZ REGULATES HilD PROTEIN ACTIVITY 6269 dependent on FliZ suggest that the primary consequence of losing Lon is increased stability of FliZ , which in turn activates HilD .
Taken together , these results suggest that FliZ regulation works at the level of HilD function and that stability is a secondary effect .
It is not clear what step in HilD function is affected by FliZ .
One possibility is that FliZ could facilitate HilD binding to promoter regions .
FliZ positively regulates HilD function at the level of HilD protein .
This regulation is independent of HilE , which clearly functions by direct protein - protein interaction .
However , like HilE , regulation is affected by both loss and overproduction of FliZ protein .
Moreover , overproduction of HilD overcomes FliZ regulation .
The FliZ protein shows significant homology only with other FliZ proteins from members of the family Enterobacteriaceae .
However , interestingly , a search of the `` conserved domains '' database shows that the C - terminal half of FliZ has a sterile alpha motif ( SAM ) - like fold .
SAM domains are known as versatile protein - protein interaction domains found in a large variety of proteins ( 38 ) .
Taking all of our data into account , we hypothesize that FliZ controls the activity of HilD by direct interaction , but we can not currently rule out indirect effects .
The instability of FliZ has made it difficult to provide biochemical data to prove or disprove direct interaction , and confirmation of our hypothesis requires further investigation .
FliZ plays a major role in the regulation of SPI1 .
Under our in - vitro conditions , it is striking how regulation of hilA mirrors regulation of fliZ ( data in reference 30 ) .
On the other hand , FliZ is also pleiotropic .
Its apparent role is to indicate to other regulatory circuits in the cell the status of the flagellar system .
To date , in Salmonella , FliZ is known to independently regulate three very different transcriptional regulators , HilD , RpoS , and FlhD 4 C 2 .
Here we show that a fliZ mutant is attenuated during intestinal colonization/invasion .
Our data suggest that part of this attenuation is via SPI1 , but the loss of FliZ has an effect in the absence of SPI1 .
Flagella are implicated in intestinal colonization ( 46 ) , and flagellin has a role in inducing intestinal inflammation ( 48 ) , which is apparently beneficial for Salmonella ( 47 ) .
The loss of FliZ decreases flagellar gene expression 2 - to 3 - fold ( 28 , 39 ) and has a detectable but modest effect in a motility assay ( 30 ) , but whether the SPI1 - independent attenuation in the fliZ mutant is due to changes in flagellar expression or other effects is not clear .
FliZ plays no apparent role during systemic infection .
This is not surprising , since neither flagella nor SPI1 are transcriptionally active ( 5 , 7 , 19 ) or required during extraintestinal infection ( 13 , 31 , 42 ) .
It is not clear why this regulatory relationship exists between flagellar and invasion systems .
It is likely that the two must be coordinated during intestinal colonization leading to invasion .
Indeed , there is coordinate regulation of induction of flagella and SPI1 in - vitro that is dependent on FliZ ( 40 ) .
Numerous regulatory systems are known to affect SPI1 expression .
Our studies show that , in most cases , these signals feed into the SPI1 regulatory circuit through HilD ( 13 , 18 , 30 ) .
On the basis of our results , we hypothesize that regulation of SPI1 is mediated predominantly at the level of HilD protein .
Therefore , understanding how environmental parameters filtered through multiple signal transduction systems are integrated at HilD is the key to SPI1 regulation .
