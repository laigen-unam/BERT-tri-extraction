To determine the base frequency conservation required for Fis to locate its binding sites , we collected a set of 60 experimentally defined wild - type Fis DNA binding sequences .
The sequence logo for Fis binding sites showed the significance and likely kinds of base contacts , and these are consistent with available experimental data .
Scanning with an information theory based weight matrix within fis , nrd , tgt/sec and gin revealed Fis sites not previously identified , but for which there are published footprinting and biochemical data .
DNA mobility - shift experiments showed that a site predicted to be 11 bases from the proximal Salmonella typhimurium hin site and a site predicted to be 7 bases from the proximal P1 cin site are bound by Fis in - vitro .
Two predicted sites separated by 11 bp found within the nrd promoter region , and one in the tgt/sec promoter , were also confirmed by gel shift analysis .
A sequence in aldB previously reported to be a Fis site , for which information theory predicts no site , did not shift .
These results demonstrate that information analysis is useful for predicting Fis DNA binding .
INTRODUCTION Fis is a pleiotropic DNA - bending protein that enhances site - specific recombination , controls DNA replication , and regulates transcription of a number of genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium ( 1 -- 4 ) .
Fis is composed of two 98 amino acid polypeptides , with each polypeptide having four α helices , A -- D. Homodimers of Fis bind to and deflect DNA from 40 to 90 ( 3,5 -- 7 ) .
Mutational analyses suggest that the N - terminal portion of the Fis monomer containing the A helix is necessary for recombination , while the C - terminal portion containing the D helix is thought to be involved in DNA binding ( 8,9 ) .
However , X - ray crystal structures of Fis reveal that the D helices appear to be too close together for Fis to fit into two successive major grooves on straight B - form DNA , suggesting that the DNA bends to accommodate Fis ( 6,10,11 ) , that Fis is flexible , or that Fis binds in a completely unanticipated manner .
Although Fis binds to precise sequences according to footprint data , it is often noted that the Fis binding site has a poorly defined consensus sequence ( 3,6,8 -- 25 ) .
Consensus sequences are often used to locate binding sites , but it is widely known that this does not work well , especially in the case of Fis ( 24 -- 26 ) .
Since a consensus is constructed by selecting the most frequent base or bases at every position across a binding site , creating a consensus sequence throws out important information about the observed frequency of bases in the binding site .
In contrast to consensus sequences , information theory provides quantitative models for binding sites .
These models are represented by the sequence logo , a graphical method that retains most of the subtleties in sequence data ( 27 -- 30 ) .
Even a glance at a sequence logo often reveals the possible nature of specific base contacts , which side of a base pair is likely to face the protein , and whether or not the DNA is distorted away from B - form ( 30,31 ) .
Because of its importance in a variety of genetic systems and because many binding sites were already well defined , interaction of Fis with DNA was an attractive candidate for a thorough information analysis .
In addition to the information content measure ( 32 ) and the sequence logo ( 29 ) , we used a new method , ` individual information ' ( R i ) , that defines the information content of individual binding sites ( 33 ) and displays the results graphically as a ` sequence walker ' ( 34 ) .
These methods have an advantage over other methods in that training is not required to obtain a quantitative binding site model , and only examples of functional sites are used to construct the model .
Using well - defined biochemical data helps to ensure that the models are realistic .
Our analysis of Fis binding sites and their surrounding sequences revealed many previously unidentified sites adjacent to known ones , and experiments demonstrated that some of the predicted sequences are indeed bound by Fis in - vitro .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Nucleotide sequences and binding sites Fis sites identified by footprinting , gel shift or mutational data were gathered from the GenBank accession numbers , coordinates and orientations shown in Figure 1 .
The exact alignment of the sites was confirmed by maximizing the information content ( 54 ) .
A few of the sites previously footprinted were not included .
Site II at coordinate 238 of the aldB promoter has an information content of -- 5.3 bits , which strongly implies that it is not a binding site .
It was noted in Xu and Johnson ( 53 ) that this site is the weakest of all sites and that it gives effects on the DNase I footprint only at * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

No. 124 4995 being at coordinate 348 on X01828 .
This had a -- 0.9 bit site which was on the edge of the DNase I footprint shown in figure 5 of ref .
Since there is a 4.4 bit site at coordinate 336 which fits the DNase I footprint exactly , we used it instead .
In the regions around the first 46 sites ( Fig. 1 ) the information theory weight matrix model consistently revealed Fis binding sites for which experimental footprinting data already exist , but which had been missed by searches using a consensus sequence .
At this point of our collection , we began using the first 46 sites to help locate the remaining sites ( 33 ) .
We examined the R6K γ origin with our current model and found multiple overlapping Fis sites , only some of which correspond to the available footprint data ( 26 ) .
We believe that further experimental analysis of these sites is warranted before they are included in our model .
We used coordinate +48 instead of +51 for ndh site III because it was the closest match ( 55 ) .
The model revealed seven sites that correspond to the DNase I hypersensitive locations on hns footprints , so we used these ( 56 ) .
Sequence analysis programs Delila system programs were used for handling sequences and information calculations ( 29,32 -- 34,43,57,58 ) .
Figures were generated automatically from raw GenBank data using Delila and UNIX script programs .

Aligned listing of Fis sites .
Sixty Fis binding sites oriented so that there is an A or G in the center were listed by the Alist program .
The numbers in the bar on the top are read vertically and give the position in the binding site , running from -- 10 to +10 .
The name , GenBank accession number , coordinate , orientation relative to the GenBank entry , number , sequence and individual information content R i ( bits ) are given on each line .
Each base has been assigned a standard color ( a : green ; c : blue ; g : orange ; t : red ) throughout this paper .
Sequence numbers 47 -- 60 are the new set of 14 sites referred to in ref .
Footprint data and sequences were obtained from the following : fis ( 18,19 ) ; oriC ( 16,42,71 ) ; rrnB ( 14,72,73 ) ; thrU ( tufB ) ( 74,75 ) ; tyrT ( 21,48 ) ; nrd ( 44 ) ; tgt/sec ( 45 ) ; aldB ( 53 ) ; proP ( 76 ) ; Tn5 ( 41 ) ; hin ( 12,77 ) ; cin ( 49 ) ; gin ( 9,78,79 ) ; Mu left end ( 80,81 ) ; Mu right end ( 80 ) ; lambda att ( 36 ) ; lambda O L I , O L II , pUC19 lacP , oriE ( 25 ) ; ndh ( 55 ) ; hns ( 56 ) .
the highest concentration of Fis .
Since , according to the model built from the 60 sites listed in Figure 1 , the probability that site II is a naturally occurring Fis binding site is < 4.6 × 10 -- 6 , and there were no better nearby sites , we did not include it in our model .
The last cin site at 336 was listed in Finkel and Johnson ( cin site # 4 ) ( 4 ) as Design of Fis binding experiments In designing the sequences of Figure 6 we chose the hin site of S.typhimurium ( 12 ) because it is well characterized and the binding site prediction is clear .
We chose 32 bases of the hin sequence because according to the information - theory based search ( Fig. 5 ) this region contains two overlapping Fis sites , one of which is the Fis site proximal to the recombination junction hixL ( 12 ) .
We added five bases of natural DNA sequence on each end -- half a twist of DNA -- to be sure we were not missing important components , although this region does not show up significantly in the sequence logo .
Beyond these ends we added EcoRI and HindIII overhangs .
We created three other sequences using the anti - consensus of the Fis weight matrix to destroy the proximal site , the newly identified ` medial ' site , or both sites .
The anti - consensus sequence is the sequence that should bind Fis the worst ( 33 ) .
It is predicted from the number of bases at each position or the R iw ( b , l ) matrix by noting which bases appear least frequently at each position of the site or which give the lowest weight .
In ambiguous cases we chose C or G when possible because these appear rarely in the logo ( Fig. 2 ) .
( Note : the anti - consensus sequence in the early model we used had C at -- 5 rather than G. ) These sequences and their complements were synthesized ( The Midland Certified Reagent Co. , Midland , TX , USA ) so that when annealed they provide sticky EcoRI and HindIII ends .
Annealed oligos were ligated into plasmid pTS385 ( 59 ) which had been digested with EcoRI and HindIII , and transformed into E.coli DH5α ( 60 ) as previously described ( 61 ) .
Transformants were selected on LB media containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin and 50 µg/ml of ampicillin .
When necessary , we transformed E.coli BL21/DE3 ( 62 ) and selected them on the same media containing 1 mM IPTG .
We knew from previous experiments that the parental plasmid pTS385 is conditionally lethal to this strain because a strong T7 promoter is positioned between the EcoRI and HindIII sites ( 59 ) .
Induction of the chromosomally imbedded T7 RNA polymerase gene with IPTG thus provided a strong selection for recombinant 4996 Nucleic Acids Research , 1997 , Vol .

When recombinants were identified , plasmid DNA was transformed into and maintained within E.coli DH5α .
The sequence between the EcoRI and HindIII sites was then confirmed by dideoxy sequencing with an ABI model 373A automated sequencer ( 63 ) .
For gel mobility - shifts ( 64,65 ) , we used Fis protein cloned and purified from E.coli obtained as a gift from R.Johnson ( 66 ) .
Plasmid DNA from the four hin clones was purified by the method of Birnboim and Doly ( 67 ) or Hengen ( 68 ) , linearized with EcoRI , end - filled with biotin - 16 - dUTP using the Klenow fragment of E.coli DNA polymerase I , and digested with BglII , which cleaves 368 bp from the EcoRI site .
The smaller fragment was purified away from the vector by electrophoresis and then digested with HindIII .
Binding assays were accomplished by incubating DNA at ∼ 1 nM with various concentrations of Fis protein as 2 - fold serial dilutions beginning with 1000 nM , and at room temperature for 15 min in 25 mM Tris -- HCl pH - 7.6 , 80 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 2 mM DTT , 100 µg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin and 125 µg/ml calf thymus DNA ( 12 ) .
Gel shift analysis was done by separation of the different species on an 8.0 % polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE .
The DNA was electro - transferred onto Tropilon - Plus TM positively charged nylon membrane and detected using a Southern - Light TM chemiluminescent kit ( 69 ) using the CSPD ® substrate ( CAS = 142849 - 53 - 4 , Tropix , Inc. , Bedford , MA , USA ) .
For experiments designed to confirm Fis binding , chosen Fis sites were engineered as single - stranded DNAs such that the DNA loops back onto itself by forming a hairpin turn structure centered at 5 ′ - GCGAAGC - 3 ′ ( 70 ) .
The natural Fis sequence from -- 10 to +10 was used and an EcoRI restriction site added on the open end .
The DNA sequence was further checked for any extraneous Fis sites above 0 bits by using walkers ( 34 ) .

Gel shift assays were performed essentially as before , except that the DNA was diluted to 1 nM in Fis binding buffer , heated to 90 C for 10 min , and slowly cooled to room temperature .
The self - annealing property obviated the need for further manipulation of the DNA .
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Interpretation of the Fis sequence logo To create a model for Fis binding , 60 Fis binding sites for which DNA footprinting or mutational data are available were collected ( Fig. 1 ) .
Each footprint was compared to the prediction from information scans and walkers to be sure that the location of the binding sites matched the final model .
By this method , the locations of several sites given in previous compilations were corrected ( see Materials and Methods ) .
Since E.coli and S.typhimurium Fis proteins have identical amino - acid sequences ( 3,24 ) and no modifications that we are aware of , we used binding sites from both species .
This would be 4997 Nucleic Acids Research , 1994 , 1997 , Vol .
No. 124 4997 inappropriate if in - vivo DNA binding conditions are different between the two species .
Because Fis binds as a dimer ( 6,10 ) , the sequences and their complements were aligned to produce a sequence logo ( 29 ) .
Analysis of such logos can reveal interaction details that are otherwise obscured by a consensus ( 31 ) .
From the sequences , the sequence logo ( Fig. 2a ) the structure of DNA base pairs ( Fig. 2b ) , and molecular modeling , the following observations were made : ( i ) The correlation between sequence conservation peaks at ± 7 and ± 3 and a 10.6 base spacing ( shown by the sine wave in the figure ) suggests that Fis makes contacts in two consecutive major grooves ( 31 ) .
Further , the information content at ± 7 is above one bit , which also suggests major groove binding ( 30,35 ) .
This is consistent with protection data showing that the methylation of the major groove N7 of G at ± 7 interferes with Fis binding ( 12 ) , with Fis binding that protects against DMS methylation at ± 7 ( 36 ) , and with hydroxyl radical footprints ( 37 ) .
( ii ) As seen on the logo , if an A is substituted for the majority G at -- 7 ( or the complementary G at +7 ) , a possible G - O6 contact would be lost while a G - N7 contact could be retained as A - N7 .
On the other hand , if T is substituted , a G - N7 contact would be lost but a G - O6 contact could be replaced by T - O4 .
This is consistent with the observed frequency of bases at position -- 7 ( and it 's complement at +7 ) for which G > A ∼ T > C .
That the frequency of As and Ts are nearly the same at this position suggests this A - N7 contact is energetically equivalent to a T - O4 contact .
Similar contacts appear at ± 15 in OxyR binding sites ( 31 ) and at +6 / -- 7 in CRP ( 30 ) .
The conservation can be explained by direct contacts or indirect through - water bonds .
( iii ) At position ± 6 there is no observed sequence conservation , yet methylation of a G in the major groove at that position interferes with Fis binding ( 12 ) .
This suggests that Fis passes close to the base in that region but does not make a specific contact .
( iv ) At -- 4 and +3 the logo shows conservation of Cs or Ts , while at positions -- 3 and +4 the logo shows the complementary As or Gs .
Because N7 is the only contact common to both A and G in the major groove ( Fig. 2b ) , this observation suggests that all four positions have N7 contacts ( 38 ) .
These contacts are consistent with DMS interference experiments ( 12 ) .
The relative heights of the letters reveal a 4.8 - fold preference for A over G at -- 3 ( T over C at +3 ) , suggesting other direct contacts in the major groove or DNA bending effects .
( v ) At positions 0 , ± 1 and ± 2 there is an A - T region where Fis most likely faces the minor groove .
Since A is as frequent as T but C and G are allowed at low frequency , this preference could be caused by a series of protein probes that sterically interfere with the N2 of G in the minor groove ( Fig. 2b ) ( 30 ) .
Consistent with this , methylation of A at N3 in the minor groove at positions 0 and ± 1 interferes with Fis binding ( 12,39 ) .
( vi ) The -- 4 to +4 central region of the Fis logo can be interpreted in a different way .
We constructed a three - dimensional model of Fis - DNA binding predicted from the logo and probable contact points ( see http://www - lmmb.ncifcrf.gov/∼toms/fismodels/ for details ) .
Mutations at Arg 85 and Lys 91 of Fis alter its ability to bind DNA ( 8,9 ) , and molecular dynamics docking of Fis with DNA supports the notion that these residues contact the DNA ( 40 ) .
When we compressed a Fis binding site in the minor groove from -- 2 to +2 to account for the A - T region , kinked the DNA at ± 3.5 and ± 7.5 to create a bend at pyrimidine -- purine pairs , and aligned Fis so that Arg 85 contacts G ± 7 and Lys 91 contacts phosphate ± 1.5 , an unavoidable gap appeared that prevents direct contact between Fis and bases -- 4 to +4 .
Because our detailed model incorporates all the features observed in the sequence logo , and shows the same gap observed by others ( 5,6,10,11,40 ) , the entire conservation from -- 4 to +4 might be accounted for by indirect contacts instead of direct contacts .
Direct contacts represent physical contact between the protein and the DNA , while indirect ` contacts ' are those in which there is no direct contact but instead the structure of the DNA is distorted , indirectly leading to sequence conservation .
Since molecular modeling is not entirely reliable , both the direct and the indirect binding modes are plausible and further experimental work would be required to distinguish between them .
However , these two binding modes are not exclusive since it is possible that Fis can flex enough to bind to straight DNA using direct contacts to all of the bases .
Subsequently , the DNA could bend using the bending properties of the central bases .
( vii ) The sequence logo shows that Fis sites easily accommodate the Dam methylase site 5 ′ - GATC - 3 ′ at ± 4 through ± 7 , suggesting that under some circumstances Fis binding may be controlled by methylation .
A Fis site in Tn5 is only bound when overlapping GATCs are unmethylated ( 41 ) .
The only other occurrence of GATC within a Fis site in our list ( Fig. 1 ) is at 0 to +3 of oriC Fis - 283 , so there may be a connection between Fis and this feature of the origin of DNA replication , as suggested previously ( 42 ) .
( viii ) It is possible that the bases at one position of a Fis site are correlated to those in another position .
For example , an A at -- 3 might only appear when there is an A at -- 2 , but not when there is a T at -- 2 .
This would make the sequence logo an incomplete model because these are not displayed .
The Diana program ( 43 ) shows only faint correlations between -- 20 and -- 19 ( 0.14 bits ; P < 1 × 10 -- 7 given the background of correlations from -- 20 to +20 of -- 0.02 ± 0.03 bits ) and between -- 2 and -- 1 ( 0.12 bits ; P < 1 × 10 -- 6 ) and their complements .
As these values are within the error of the total sequence conservation ( ± 0.27 bits ) , there is little or no missing sequence conservation in the sequence logo model .
Searching specific sequences with the Fis individual information weight matrix model To model the base preferences of Fis , we computed a weight matrix from : R iw ( b , l ) = 2 + log 2 f ( b , l ) -- e ( n ) ( bits per base ) 1 where f ( b , l ) is the frequency of each base b at position l in the aligned binding site sequences and their complements , and e ( n ) is a sample size correction factor for the n = 120 sequences used to create f ( b , l ) ( 33 ) .
R iw ( b , l ) values range between -- ∞ and 2 bits .
To evaluate a DNA sequence , the bases of the sequence are aligned with the matrix entries and the R iw ( b , l ) values corresponding to each base are added together to produce the total R i value .
This measure has several advantages over other methods .
First , the scale is in bits , which are easy units to think about and which allow direct comparison to many other systems .
Second , by adding the weights together for various positions in a particular binding site , we get the total ` individual information ' ( R i ) for that site .
Third , the average R i for all of the binding sites used to create the R iw ( b , l ) matrix is the average information content , R sequence ( 32 ) .
This is the same as the area under the sequence logo .
Fourth , unlike a neural network that needs to be cyclically trained and requires both sites and non - sites , the matrix can be created immediately using only proven sites as examples .
This avoids the danger of training 4998 Nucleic Acids Research , 1997 , Vol .

The position of the zero base of the Fis weight matrix on the sequence is given on the abscissa , while the individual information for the sequence surrounding each position from -- 10 to +10 is given on the ordinate .
This is computed at each position by adding together the weights that correspond to the sequence around the zero base .
The DNA sequence is from GenBank accession K02672 ( 84 ) .
Transcription begins at position 0 ( GenBank coordinate 3395 ) and proceeds to the right ( arrow ) .
Fifteen potential Fis sites ( R i ≥ 2 bits ) were located in the region from -- 400 to +100 relative to the start of transcription .
Five Fis sites , indicated by filled squares ( ) , were identified by Augustin et al. ( 44 ) to be in the ranges : -- 328 to -- 310 ( probably site -- 327 ) , -- 285 to -- 268 ( probably site -- 272 since it is the closest to the center of this range ) , -- 204 to -- 187 ( probably site -- 202 ) , -- 160 to -- 142 ( probably site -- 158 ) , and -- 139 to -- 122 ( probably site -- 129 ) relative to the start of transcription .
These five are listed in Figure 1 .
Additional sites that were located by the Scan program and are visible on the footprinting data of Augustin et al. ( their fig. 3 , lanes 4 and 5 ) but not previously described , are indicated by open squares ( ) .
They are at positions : -- 349 , -- 348 , -- 283 , -- 230 , -- 221 , -- 209 and -- 173 .

against unknown functional sites , and therefore was critical for obtaining the results presented here .
Fifth , functional binding sites have positive R i values , within the error of the method , allowing one to make predictions .
Finally , unlike consensus sequences which destroy the available sequence data by arbitrarily rounding the frequencies up or down , the individual information method uses the base frequences directly and so it preserves subtleties in the data .
Validation of the individual information scanning method We used individual information ( 33 ) to study Fis binding sites throughout the E.coli genome and at several specific loci .
Although the theoretical cutoff for distinguishing sites from non - sites is 0 bits , we often used a conservative 2 bit cutoff to define Fis sites because our previous experience showed that sites between 0 and 2 bits can bind Fis ( data not shown ) .
When comparing the output from the Scan , DNAplot , MakeWalker and Lister programs to previously reported footprinting data , we consistently found sites which were seen as DNase I protected regions .
For example , by using a degenerate consensus pattern , previous workers found five Fis binding sites upstream of the transcriptional start site of the nrd operon of E.coli ( 44 ) .
When we scanned for potential Fis binding sites , several more sites were identified ( Fig. 3 ) .
These were confirmed to be bona fide sites since Cu - phenanthroline footprinting of this region had already been done by Augustin et al. .
Their data ( Fig. 3 , lanes 4 and 5 ) correspond well with our predictions even though none of these additional sites were used in the R iw ( b , l ) model .

This is set by using a switch within the DNAplot parameter file .
position -- 58 of the tgt/sec promoter ( 45 ) , an information scan shows a second strong site at -- 73 ( 34 ) .
Both tgt/sec sites were included in our model because they are supported by footprinting , gel shift and in - vivo transcriptional assays .
Although Fis has a poor consensus sequence , theoretically it can bind precisely ( 46,47 ) , and indeed footprints reveal concise binding on well separated sites .
Complex footprints appear to be imprecise binding if one uses a consensus sequence .
Often the protected genetic regions can be dissected into their components by using individual information tools , so that the data is interpreted as representing overlapping sites .

No. 124 4999 Using sequence conservation to infer the number of Fis sites in E.coli The total number of Fis sites in the E.coli genome is not known , so the information needed to locate those sites ( R frequency ) can not be calculated ( 32 ) .
However , the total sequence conservation at the binding sites is 7.86 ± 0.27 bits ( Fig. 2 ) , which suggests that there is one site roughly every 2 7.86 ± 0.27 = 232 ± 43 bases or an average of 4.7 ± 0.9 sites at each of the ∼ 4289 genes of the entire 4 638 858 bp E.coli genome ( GenBank accession no .
U00096 , version of 16 - JAN - 1997 ) .
It also implies that ∼ 20 000 ± 3700 Fis molecules would be needed to fill all Fis sites on a single chromosome .
Using the method of individual information we scanned the genome and found 68 552 Fis sites with > 2 bits of sequence conservation .
These estimates are comparable to the number of Fis molecules per cell , which ranges from close to zero in stationary cells to between 25 000 and 50 000 Fis dimers per cell during the transition to exponential - growth or an increase in nutrients ( 18 ) .
Thus , almost every Fis site could be filled by one Fis dimer under those growth - conditions .
A cluster of Fis sites at the fis promoter Fis is an autoregulatory protein with six strong binding sites and a number of lower - affinity sites near its promoter ( 18,19 ) .
A scan of the E.coli fis promoter shows up to 12 additional sites ( ≥ 2 bits ) in the immediate region of the promoter , but few downstream ( Fig. 4a and b ) .
Presumably the additional sites correspond to the weaker sites noted by Ball et al. ( 18 ) .
In a recent study of the corresponding region of DNA from the S.typhimurium fis promoter ( 24 ) , the authors noted that Fis sites are highly degenerate and so they could not predict which sites of the E.coli fis promoter region are also present in S.typhimurium .
They used DNase I footprinting to determine the locations of Fis sites and found that the sites upstream of -- 49 were weak in S.typhimurium relative to those in E.coli .
Figure 4c demonstrates that this result is predicted by information analysis .
Notably , at high concentrations of Fis the weaker sites can be observed by footprinting ( 24 ) .
In transcriptional activation of stable RNA promoters by Fis , the Fis sites are immediately upstream of the promoter on one face of the DNA and cover a region of 50 bp ( 48 ) .
Repression at the fis promoter is different because the Fis sites are spread over 350 bp and are also 90 bp downstream of the start of transcription ( Fig. 4 ) .
Fis levels increase dramatically after nutritional upshift ( 18 ) and under these conditions many of these sites should be occupied simultaneously .
Because Fis bends DNA when it binds , the multiple DNA contortions might exclude RNA polymerase and silence transcriptional initiation .
As levels of Fis protein decrease in the cell , the physical blockage would be relieved and transcription could proceed again .
Fis sites at recombinational enhancers Fis sites have been identified on recombinational enhancers ( 3,4,12,13,49,50 ) .
In the S.typhimurium hin region there are two Fis sites that are proximal and distal to the hixL recombination site .
An information scan of this region shows a third potential Fis site located 11 bp [ ∼ 1 helical turn of DNA , 10.6 bp ( 51,52 ) ] to the right of and overlapping the proximal site ( Fig. 5 , top left ) .
We call this site the ` medial ' site ; it is 37 bp ( ∼ 3.5 helical turns ) to the left Figure 5 .

Symbols are the same as in Figure 4 .
Previously identified Fis sites are marked with filled squares ( ) and named as in refs 3,4 .
The proposed Fis sites with R i ≥ 2 bits are marked with a circle inside a square .
Spacing between sites is indicated by numbers surrounded by dashes .
Note that the spacing between proximal and distal sites is always 48 bases ( 11 + 37 on the left three graphs ) ( 2 ) .

of the distal site .
The same structure is found in bacteriophage Mu gin and p15B min enhancers ( Fig. 5 , left three graphs ) .
In the bacteriophage P1 cin , bacteriophage P7 cin , and E.coli e14 pin enhancers , a potential overlapping site occurs 7 bp ( ∼ 1/2 helical turn ) to the left of the previously identified proximal site ( Fig. 5 , right three graphs ) .
Since this potential site is outside the region between the proximal and distal sites , we named it the ` external ' site .
At recombinational enhancer proximal Fis sites , when a potential new Fis site is found on the right , it is 11 bases away while when a potential new Fis site is found on the left , it is 7 bases away .
It is not known whether this correlation is coincidental .
We also observed that potential Fis sites corresponding in location to site III in gin ( 9 ) appear in all other enhancers scanned except hin and that in three cases a weaker potential site falls exactly between the distal site and the one corresponding to site III with spacings of 11 -- 12 bp .
Predicted Fis sites are bound in - vitro Scanning the Fis R iw ( b , l ) model across DNA inversion regions reveals pairs of Fis sites spaced either 7 or 11 bases apart ( Fig. 5 ) .

Oligonucleotide design of mutant S.typhimurium hin Fis binding sites .
In the first construction , at the top of the figure , the wild - type sequence containing the proximal Fis site from the S.typhimurium hin region ( HW , hin wild - type ) is given ( coordinates 117 -- 158 of GenBank accession V01370 ) , flanked by EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites .
The known proximal site ( R i = 8.3 bits ) is indicated next to the predicted medial site ( R i = 6.9 bits ) .
Both sites are shown by walkers ( 34 ) .
The vertical bars extend from -- 5 to +2 bits .
Normal orientation of letters indicates positive contribution to the sequence conservation of the site , while inverted letters indicate negative contribution .
The height of each letter is given by the information weight matrix according to equation 1 .
The total sequence conservation is the sum of the letter heights .
Sites with conservation more than zero bits ( green bars ) are expected to be bound by Fis , those less than zero bits ( pink bars ) are expected not to be bound by Fis .
In the second construction , the right anti - consensus Fis site sequence ( HR , hin right ) was used to destroy the medial site , leaving the proximal site intact .
In the third construction , the left anti - consensus ( HL , hin left ) was used to destroy the proximal site while leaving the medial site intact .
In the fourth construction , both ( HB , hin both ) sites were destroyed .
See Materials and Methods section for design details .
Three of the sites are the footprinted proximal sites .
In addition , the medial site for gin is supported by footprint data , but it was not identified as a Fis site ( 9 ) .
To test whether the proposed medial site exists at hin we performed gel shift experiments on DNAs in which we presumably had knocked out neither , one , or both of the sites .
The DNA design is shown in Figure 6 using sequence walkers , a graphical representation of the individual information content at specific binding sites ( 34 ) .
Characters representing the sequence are either oriented normally and placed above a line indicating favorable contact , or upside - down and placed below the line indicating unfavorable contact .
Functional sites therefore have most letters pointing upwards , while those we have destroyed have many letters pointing downwards .
The walkers also show that we did not inadvertently create any other Fis sites .

Mobility shift experiments for hin .
Gel shifts of DNA containing the hin proximal and medial Fis binding sites .
Each lane contains increasing concentrations of Fis protein added , beginning with no Fis protein , Fis diluted 1 to 8 , etc. .
The 1:1 ratio is 1000 nM Fis .
Letter designations refer to the sequences given in Figure 6 .
Mobility shift experiments for predicted Fis sites .
Gel shifts of hairpin structures containing the aldBII at 238 ( -- 5.3 bits ) , cin external site at 174 ( 2.8 bits ) , tgt/sec at -- 73 ( 10.8 bits ) , nrdF1 site at -- 283 ( 14.6 bits ) and nrdF2 site at -- 272 ( 5.0 bits ) .
Each lane contains 20 µl of 1 nM DNA with either no Fis ( -- ) or 1000 nM Fis added ( + ) .
The marker lane ( M ) contains 10 ng of biotinylated φX174 HinfI digested DNA standards ( Life Technologies , Inc. ) , with sizes indicated in bp .
The original X - ray film and photograph were intentionally overexposed to reveal the weaker cin shift product .
B , DNA bound to Fis ; F , free DNA .
The results of shifting the hin sequences of Figure 6 are shown in Figure 7 .
Under our experimental conditions hin does have a second site as predicted , since the knockout of the stronger proximal site still allowed the DNA to shift ( Fig. 7 , HL ) .
However , more Fis protein was required to shift an equivalent amount of DNA than for the wild - type proximal site , indicating that Fis binds weakly to the medial site .
This is consistent with the weaker sequence conservation of the medial site ( R i = 6.9 bits ) compared to the proximal site ( R i = 8.3 bits ) .
To further investigate the predictive ability of our individual information model , we synthesized five oligonucleotides representing various interesting sites : ( i ) We were curious as to whether the predicted cin external site ( 7 bases from the proximal site , R i = 2.8 bits ) , could bind Fis , even though it is so close to the proximal site ( Fig. 5 ) .
( ii ) Four lines of evidence indicate that a site predicted to be at -- 73 of the tgt/sec promoter ( R i = 10.8 bits , Fig. 1 , # 23 ) should bind Fis ( see fig. 2 of ref .
We decided to test this prediction directly .
( iii ) Footprinting data covers two overlapping sites spaced 11 bases apart within the nrd promoter at -- 283 ( nrdF1 , R i = 14.6 bits ) and -- 272 ( nrdF2 , R i = 5.0 bits , Fig. 1 , # 19 ) relative to the start of transcription ( Fig. 3 ) , but only one site had been identified ( 44 ) .
We decided to test both .
( iv ) The site previously identified as Fis site II at 238 in the aldB promoter ( 53 ) has a negative R i value ( -- 5.3 bits ) and therefore should not bind Fis .
Figure 8 shows that all four sites having positive R i values are able to bind Fis as predicted ( 33 ) .
Although the gel is not quantitative , the band intensities correlate well with information content : ( i ) The cin external site was bound weakly , suggesting that it might be involved in site - specific inversion .
( ii ) The site within the tgt/sec promoter region upstream from the start site of the queA gene ( 34 ) had been previously footprinted ( 45 ) , however , that footprint extended up to and included a DNase I hypersensitive region at -- 79 .
In addition , a secondary shift product was observed when that DNA was used in a gel shift experiment .
There are actually two adjacent Fis sites in that region since we were able to shift the one at -- 73 .
( iii ) The two sites within the nrd promoter were also previously footprinted ( 44 ) .
We show here that when separated they are individually able to bind Fis .
These two sites are likely to be responsible for the single protected region seen on the published footprint from -- 268 to -- 285 .
( iv ) Although it had been observed as a protected region on a footprint ( 53 ) , the site II at coordinate 238 of the aldB promoter has an information content of -- 5.3 bits and , as expected , it did not shift .
This justifies excluding it from the list of known sites ( see Materials and Methods ) .
We propose that the DNase - I-protection observed could be an artifact due to secondary structures formed by a DNA -- Fis complex when Fis binds to other surrounding sites .
A requirement for binding multiple Fis molecules could explain why a high concentration of Fis is required for protection ( 53 ) .
Alternatively , it could represent a special binding mode of Fis .
In summary , we have shown that information theory can be used to predict Fis binding sites , and we have confirmed some of those sites experimentally .
Furthermore , information theory can also predict when a sequence is unlikely to be a binding site .
The information theory models can be applied to any nucleic acid binding interaction , so they provide a general tool for researchers to identify and characterize binding sites .
