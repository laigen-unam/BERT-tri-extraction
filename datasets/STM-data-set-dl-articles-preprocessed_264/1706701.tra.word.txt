173 , No. 7 Negative Autoregulation of cysB in Salmonella typhimurium : In Vitro Interactions of CysB Protein with the cysB Promoter JACEK OSTROWSKI AND NICHOLAS M. KREDICH * Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry , Duke University Medical Center , Durham , North Carolina 27710 CysB protein positively regulates genes of the Salmonella typhimurium cysteine regulon and negatively autoregulates cysB .
The cysB promoter was characterized by primer - extension of cellular RNA , which gave products identifying a major in - vivo transcription start site located 95 bp upstream of the cysB start codon and two minor sites located 9 and 10 bp downstream of the major site .
Gel shift binding studies and DNase I footprinting experiments showed that CysB protein binds to the cysB promoter from position -10 to +36 relative to the major transcription start site .
We have designated this binding site CBS - B .
CysB protein inhibited transcription initiation at the cysB promoter in an in - vitro runoff assay , indicating that cysB is negatively autoregulated by the binding of CysB protein to the cysB promoter , where it acts as a repressor .
N - Acetyl - L-serine , an inducer of the cysteine regulon , inhibited the binding of CysB protein to the cysB promoter and partially reversed the ability of CysB protein to inhibit transcription initiation .
These effects are in contrast to those observed in studies of positively regulated cys promoters , in which N - acetyl - L-serine stimulates binding and causes CysB protein to activate transcription initiation .
The cysB gene of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli encodes the peptide subunit of a 144 - kDa homotetramer that acts as a transcriptional activator for the cysteine regulon , a group of at least 16 genes that function in the synthesis of L - cysteine from inorganic sulfate and in L - cystine transport ( 3 , 18 ) .
Gene activation in the cysteine regulon requires a combination of CysB protein , either O - acetyl - L-serine or its derivative N - acetyl - L-serine ( both of which serve as inducers ) , and sulfur limitation ( 15 - 17 , 29 ) .
The requirement for sulfur limitation is due to the ability of L - cysteine to feedback inhibit serine transacetylase , the enzyme that synthesizes O - acetyl - L-serine ( 19 , 20 ) , and also results from the fact that sulfide is an anti - inducer ( 30 ) .
Purified CysB protein has been shown in - vitro to bind to sequences immediately upstream of the -35 regions of the S. typhimurium cysJIH and cysK promoters and to activate transcription from these promoters in the presence of acetyl - L - serine ( 27 , 29 , 30 ) .
In cysB - lac fusion strains of E. coli , in which lac was expressed from the cysB promoter , introduction of a plasmid carrying a cysB + allele reduced P - galactosidase and lac mRNA levels as much as 10 - fold , indicating that cysB is negatively autoregulated ( 4 , 14 ) .
Thus , CysB protein appears to have a dual regulatory role , first as an activator of genes of the L - cysteine biosynthetic pathway and second as a repressor of its own gene .
In this report , we provide in - vitro evidence for negative autoregulation by showing that CysB protein binds to the cysB promoter and inhibits transcription initiation .

1 mM dithiothreitol , 100 , ug of nuclease - free bovine serum albumin per ml , approximately 20 ng of 5 ' - labeled DNA fragment ( 1 x i05 to 2 x iOs dpm ) , and various amounts of purified S. typhimurium CysB protein and N - acetyl - L-serine .
DNA concentrations were estimated by determining the amount of radiolabel present in a preparation of known specific activity .
A concentrated stock solution of CysB protein ( approximately 0.5 mg/ml ) was freshly diluted into binding buffer just before use .
After incubation for 5 min at 37 °C , 3 , ul of loading buffer ( 80 mM Tris hydrochloride [ pH 8.0 ] , 0.2 M KCl , 2 mM dithiothreitol , 50 % glycerol , 0.1 % bromophenol blue , and 200 , ug of bovine serum albumin per ml ) was added with gentle mixing , and samples were loaded onto a gel with the current on .
After 1 h at 10 V/cm , gels were dried , and radiolabeled DNA was visualized by radioautography .

Following the addition of 2 plI of sonicated calf thymus DNA ( 1 mg/ml ) and 5 pI of 0.1 M CaCl2 , digestion was initiated with 2 , ul of DNase I ( 0.1 , ug/ml ) .
After 4 min at 37 °C , the reaction was terminated with 2.5 , ul of 0.25 M disodium EDTA , pH 8.0 .

In vitro transcription assays .
Transcription runoff assays were performed as described previously ( 29 ) .
Various amounts of CysB protein , N - acetyl - L-serine , and sodium sulfide were preincubated at 37 °C in 20 , u1 of a solution containing 40 mM Tris hydrochloride , ( pH 8.0 ) , 0.1 M KCI , 10 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0.1 mM ATP , 1 p.g of template DNA per ml , 50 , ug of nuclease - free E. coli RNA polymerase ( Pharmacia - LKB Biotechnology , Inc. ) per ml , and 100 , ug of nuclease - free bovine serum albumin per ml .
After S min to allow formation of initiation complexes , 2 pul was added of a solution containing 10 , uM [ a - 32P ] CTP ( 800 Ci/mmol ) , 2 mM each ATP , GTP , and UTP , and 0.5 mg of sodium heparin per ml , and the reaction was allowed to proceed for another 5 min at 37 °C , when it was terminated by the addition of 0.2 ml of 10 mM disodium EDTA containing 50 , ug of yeast tRNA per ml .

RESULTS In vivo transcription start site .
Total RNA from wild - type S. typhimurium LT2 grown on minimal - medium containing either glutathione , sulfate , or L - cystine was used as template with reverse transcriptase to extend a 5 ' - labeled oligodeoxynucleotide primer complementary to nucleotides 8 to 30 of the cysB coding region ( primer 3328 in Fig. 1 ) .
Extension products of 124 , 115 , and 114 nucleotides , corresponding to in - vivo transcription start sites at 95 , 86 , and 85 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon , were obtained ( Fig. 2 ) .
Small differences in the amounts of extension products were noted with RNA templates from cells grown on different sulfur sources ( Fig. 2 ) but were not consistent enough in other experiments to suggest a major effect of sulfur source on cysB expression .
Since the 124 - nucleotide product constituted about 80 % of the total , we consider its start site the major one in - vivo and have designated it position + 1 in Fig. 1 .
The -10 and -35 regions of this promoter are TATAGT and TATACA , respectively .
The shorter extension products may be artifacts due to either premature termination of reverse transcriptase or in - vivo endonucleolytic degradation , or they may correspond to minor in - vivo start sites located 9 and 10 nucleotides downstream of the major start site .
The latter interpretation is favored by the presence of the sequences TATAGT and TTCAGA that are appropriately positioned at the -10 and -35 regions ( Fig. 1 ) .

region is identical to that for the major start site and offset from it by 9 bp .
Binding of CysB protein to the cysB promoter region .
We evaluated binding of CysB protein to the cysB promoter region by the gel mobility - shift assay ( 10 , 11 ) by using a PCR - generated , 5 ' - radiolabeled DNA fragment beginning at position -112 relative to the major transcription start site and extending to position + 124 ( generated with primers 3327 and 3328 ) ( Fig. 1 ) .
Preincubation of this fragment with small amounts of purified CysB protein resulted in the formation of a new electrophoretic band with a mobility of 0.57 to 0.60 relative to that of free DNA ( Fig. 3 ) .
With an input DNA concentration of 1 , ug/ml ( 6.5 nM ) , approximately 70 % of the total was complexed at 3 , ug of CysB protein per ml ( 21 nM CysB Protein ( ug ml ) 0 1 3 N - Acetylserine ( m M ) 0 0 0 of tetramer ) and binding was complete at 10 , ug/ml .
From these data a Kd of 7 x 10 ' M was calculated , which is slightly higher than the Kd of 2 x 10 ' M estimated for the binding of CysB protein to the cysK promoter ( 27 ) .
We have previously shown that nonspecific binding to DNA is minimal at these concentrations of CysB protein ( 27 , 30 ) .
It should be noted that this Kd value is only a rough approximation and is based on several assumptions , including the accuracy of our protein estimations by the dye - ligand assay method ( 6 ) with a bovine serum albumin standard , the absence of any significant loss of binding activity during purification and storage of CysB protein , and a stoichiometry of one CysB protein tetramer per DNA molecule .
In contrast to results obtained with the cysJIH and cysK promoters , which showed that specific binding of CysB protein was stimulated by the inducer N - acetyl - L-serine or O - acetyl - L-serine ( 27 , 30 ) , binding to the cysB promoter region was inhibited by N - acetyl - L-serine .
At a concentration of 3 , ug of CysB protein per ml , the addition of 5 mM N - acetyl - L-serine decreased binding from about 70 % of input to 20 % ( Fig. 3 ) .
Binding of CysB protein to the cysB promoter was further characterized by DNase I footprinting experiments .
CysB protein at 10 to 40 , ug/ml protected the nontranscribed strand of the 236 - bp DNA fragment from DNase I digestion between positions -10 and +36 relative to the major in - vivo transcription start site ( Fig. 4 ) .
Protection was also noted for the transcribed strand between positions -10 and +34 ( data not shown ) .
In agreement with the results of our gel shift binding experiments , protection was virtually eliminated by N - acetyl - L-serine at 1 and 10 mM ( Fig. 4 ) .
Previous studies have demonstrated two CysB protein - binding sites , CBS - K1 and CBS - K2 , in the cysK promoter region and a single site , CBS - J , in the cysJIH promoter ( 27 ) .
We now designate the -10 to +36 region of the cysB promoter CBS - B .
The sizes of these four regions are similar and range between 36 and 46 bp İn vitro transcription .

Products of 224 and 235 nucleotides , which correspond to initiation at the major in - vivo start site and to a site at position -11 , were observed ( Fig. 5 ) .
The longer transcript is apparently the product of a start site that was not expressed in - vivo and may be an artifact of our in - vitro conditions .
A minor transcription product of 176 nucleotides was also observed , which may be a premature termination product of a longer transcript .
CysB protein inhibited formation of all three products by 10 to 20 % at 1 , ug/ml and by about 80 % at 20 , ug/ml .
N - Acetyl - L-serine at 1 to 10 mM partially reversed inhibition by 20 , ug of CysB protein per ml ( Fig. 5 ) .
The specificity of this effect is apparent from our finding that CysB protein at 1 to 50 , ug/ml , either with or without N - acetyl - L-serine , did not affect the formation of transcription runoff products from a DNA template containing the phage A PL promoter ( data not shown ) .
The inhibitory effects of CysB protein on transcription initiation at the cysB promoter were opposite to those observed with the cysJIH and cysK promoters , where this regulatory protein , in the presence of acetyl - L-serine , acts as a transcription activator ( 27 , 29 ) .
To illustrate this difference , we performed a transcription runoff experiment with a FIG. 5 .

Reaction mixtures contained 50 , ug of RNA polymerase per * ml and a 336 - bp DNA template ( 1 , ug/ml ) extending from position -112 to +224 relative to the major in - vivo transcription start site , 4 i ; which was generated by PCR with oligonucleotide primers 3327 and * * 3329 ( Fig. 1 ) .

The preferred in - vitro start site for cysJIH transcription initiation varies from one template to another in a way that has not been systematically characterized ( 30a ) .
For the template used in this study , the major transcript was 90 nucleotides in length and corresponded to initiation from a minor in - vivo start site ( 29 ) .
The results of this experiment showed that formation of the two major cysB transcripts was maximal in the absence of CysB protein and N - acetyl - L-serine , while transcription from the cysJIH promoter in the same reaction mixture was almost unmeasurable ( Fig. 6 ) .
Addition of 20 jxg of CysB protein per ml inhibited transcription from the cysB promoter by about 70 % with no effect on the cysJIH promoter .
The further addition of 0.3 mM or 1 mM N - acetyl - L - serine reversed the inhibitory effects of CysB protein on the cysB promoter and markedly stimulated transcription from the cysJIH promoter .
Furthermore , sulfide , which is known to act as an anti - inducer of the cysteine regulon ( 17 , 30 ) , inhibited formation of the cysJIH transcript in the presence of 1 mM N - acetyl - L-serine but did not affect the cysB transcript ( Fig. 6 ) .
DISCUSSION The in - vitro studies reported here indicate that negative autoregulation of cysB , originally proposed on the basis of in vivo properties of cysB - lac fusion strains ( 4 , 14 ) , is due to the ability of CysB protein to bind to the cysB promoter and inhibit transcription .
Autoregulation has been described for the genes of a number of prokaryote transcriptional - activator proteins ( 8 , 32 , 36 ) and appears to be particularly common among members of the LysR family of regulatory genes ( 12 ) , of which cysB is a member .

Comparison of the effects of CysB protein , N - acetyl - Lserine , and sulfide on transcription initiation from the cysB and cysJIH promoters in an in - vitro runoff assay .
All reactions contained a mixture of two PCR - generated DNA templates , each at 1 , ug per ml .
The 336 - bp cysB promoter template was the same as that described in the legend to Fig. 5 and extended from position -112 to + 124 relative to the major in - vivo transcription start site .
The 315 - bp cysJIH promoter template extended from position -218 to +97 relative to the major in - vivo transcription start site ( 29 ) .
Mixtures were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with CysB protein , N - acetyl - L - serine , and sulfide as indicated , and radiolabeled transcription runoff products were generated and analyzed on a sequencing gel as described in Materials and Methods .
The middle portion of the gel has been cut away .
The upper portion of the gel shows two major cysB runoff products of 235 and 224 nucleotides .
The lower portion of the gel shows a major cysJIH runoff product of 90 nucleotides and a minor product of 88 nucleotides .
The identity of runoff products was established in separate reactions containing single DNA templates ( not shown ) .

For many members of the LysR family , the regulatory J. BACTERIOL .
gene promoter is adjacent to or overlaps the promoter for a gene ( or group of genes ) , which is positively controlled by the regulatory gene product , and the two units are transcribed divergently .
In theory , this arrangement allows the binding of a protein at a single site to both activate the positively regulated promoter and repress the regulatory gene promoter .
A variation of this model is found in the ilvC - ilvY promoter region of E. coli , where IlvY protein binds cooperatively to two virtually contiguous sites ( 41 ) .
A major requirement for a common binding site is that it must position the regulatory protein to facilitate the binding of RNA polymerase to the activated promoter while inhibiting binding to the regulatory gene promoter - presumably by a steric mechanism .
cysB is not linked to a positively controlled gene ( 28 ) , however , and the absence of a requirement for gene activation may explain certain differences between CBS - B and binding sites CBS - J ( 29 , 30 ) and CBS - K1 ( 27 ) , which mediate activation of the cysJIH and cysK promoters by CysB protein and acetyl - L-serine .
One of the most striking differences between these sites is that acetyl - Lserine stimulates CysB protein binding to CBS - J and CBS - K1 and , as demonstrated in this report , inhibits CysB protein binding to CBS - B .
The autoregulated oxyR gene in E. coli is also not linked to any of the genes for which it serves as an activator ( 9 ) , but although DNase I footprints are qualitatively different with reduced and oxidized forms of highly purified OxyR protein , appreciable quantitative differences in binding to positively and negatively regulated promoters have not been observed ( 37 ) .
The ability of N - acetyl - L-serine to inhibit the binding of CysB protein to the cysB promoter and to reverse inhibition of in - vitro - transcription initiation suggests that this phenomenon might have relevance in - vivo .
By altering the sensitivity of the cysB promoter to negative autoregulation , N - acetyl - L-serine , itself a signal of sulfur limitation , could serve to fine - tune cysB expression in response to changing conditions of sulfur availability .
The results of our primer extension analyses , however , gave no indication that cysB mRNA levels vary between cells grown on either L - cystine , sulfate , or the limiting sulfur source glutathione .

These results are consistent with those obtained with cysB - lac fusion strains , in which lac expression directed from the cysB promoter was not affected by the type of sulfur compound used for growth ( 14 ) .
Inhibition of CysB protein binding by acetyl - L-serine has also been described for another binding site , designated CBS - K2 , which is upstream of and contiguous with CBS - K1 in the cysK promoter ( 27 ) .
Deletion of CBS - K2 does not affect in - vivo cysK promoter strength , and at present this binding site has no known function .
A DNA sequence comparison of CBS - B and CBS - K2 from S. typhimurium and the corresponding regions from E. coli shows only a small region of similarity ( Fig. 7 ) .
All four contain at least one copy of the sequence TTATT , which is also found in CBS - J and CBS - K1 .
Thus far , we have been unable to define a consensus DNA sequence that would constitute a cysteine box , and it is not known whether the TTATT sequence is important for CysB protein binding .
The ability of CysB protein to respond to acetyl - L-serine with either an increase or a decrease in affinity for different DNA sequences raises the question of whether these two types of binding occur at the same or separate regions of the protein .
By analogy with certain other DNA - binding proteins , the binding domain of CysB protein is postulated to reside in a helix - turn - helix motif predicted to occur in amino acid residues 18 to 38 ( 7 ) .
Although no direct experimental evidence for the interaction of this region with either type of DNA sequence exists , it is of interest that a Ser - * Arg change at amino - acid - residue 34 in the cysB70 protein results in both a cysB mutant genotype and the loss of in - vivo autoregulation ( 2 , 9a ) .
