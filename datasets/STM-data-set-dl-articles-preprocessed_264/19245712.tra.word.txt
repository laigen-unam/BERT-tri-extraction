Abstract Background : The survival of Salmonella enterica within the intracellular host niche requires highly co - ordinated expression of virulence effectors predominantly regulated by the SsrAB twocomponent regulatory system .
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium mutants lacking the ssrAB genes are avirulent in mice , highlighting the importance of this regulatory system in - vivo .
Mutants lacking the gene encoding the alternative sigma factor σ E ( rpoE ) are also highly attenuated for intracellular survival , pointing to a potential connection with the SsrAB regulatory system .
Results : In this study we demonstrate that RpoE is involved in fine - tuning the expression of a subset of SsrB - regulated genes found in the Salmonella pathogenicity island - 2 ( SPI - 2 ) genetic locus that encodes a horizontally acquired type III secretion system , and unlinked genes integrated into this regulon that are required for virulence in host animals .
Conclusion : These data point to a potential connection between the virulence phenotype of strains lacking ssrB and rpoE , and highlight new transcriptional regulation that might be essential for appropriate temporal and spatial control of the virulence - associated type III secretion system during host infection .
Background Salmonella enterica are enteric pathogens that acquired a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) through horizontal gene transfer of a genomic island termed Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 ( SPI - 2 ) [ 1,2 ] .
The SPI - 2-encoded T3SS and its translocated effectors modify the intracellular host niche for Salmonella replication [ 3 - 5 ] .
SPI - 2 also has genes , ssrA and ssrB , which code for SsrAB , a two - component regulatory system needed for expression of the T3SS [ 6,7 ] .
SsrB regulates the expression of SPI - 2 encoded substrate effectors including ssaB , as well as several integrated virulence effectors such as sseL [ 8 ] and srfN [ 9 ] that are encoded elsewhere on the chromosome but that have integrated into the SsrB regulon .
Mutants lacking ssrAB are unable to survive within macrophages and are avirulent in mice [ 1 ] .
Alternative sigma factors coordinate gene expression in response to environmental cues sensed by the bacterium .
Sigma factors have a specific recognition motif at the -35 and -10 positions and function to concentrate RNA polymerase at a subset of promoters [ 10 ] .
One alternative sigma factor , RpoE ( σ E ) responds to envelope stress at the cell surface .
Release of σ E from its inner membrane anchored anti - sigma factor , RseA , leads to induction of genes required to maintain cell envelope integrity [ 11 ] .

Typhimurium against host cell defences such as oxidative - stress and antimicrobial peptides that perturb bacterial membrane integrity and provide a stimulus for σ E release [ 4,12 - 15 ] .
Although proficient at cellular invasion , rpoE or ssrB mutants are highly attenuated for intracellular survival in both cultured cells and animal hosts [ 16 ] .
In addition , the expression of rpoE and ssrB is up - regulated within macrophages [ 17 ] .
Links between RpoE and virulence gene expression is evident in other bacterial systems as well .
Deletion of rseA in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis causes elevated virulence effector synthesis and secretion [ 18 ] , establishing links between alternative sigma factors and virulence - specific regulators .
Taken together , a connection between σ E and SsrB is suggested from the available literature , however the role of σ E in activating SsrB - regulated genes has not been studied .
Results Deletion of rpoE affects a subset of SsrB - regulated virulence genes Salmonella virulence gene expression is coordinated in - vivo and may be regulated , in part , by alternative sigma factor ( s ) in order to quickly respond to the host environment .
To date , no sigma factor has been identified as regulating SsrB - dependent virulence genes .
To start , we first screened four alternative sigma factor mutants of S. Typhimurium ( rpoS , rpoN , rpoE , rpoH ) for their ability to express a key virulence gene , sseB , that requires SsrB for expression and whose gene product is essential for intracellular pathogenesis .
For an rpoH deletion , this strain was only viable at temperatures below 30 °C .
Since SPI - 2 gene activation is integrated into a thermosensing circuit [ 19 ] we were unable to test the role of σ H in this study ( data not shown ) .
In this screen , rpoS deletion resulted in a slight increase in SseB levels ( Figure 1A ) indicating a role for RpoS in the repression of SPI - 2 .
Both rpoE and rpoN deletions resulted in decreased SseB levels with a more pronounced effect in the rpoE deletion .
Since we were predominantly interested in sigma factors that activate SPI - 2 and which could be linked to the previous observation that rpoE mutants are highly attenuated in - vivo we choose to focus on RpoE in the current study , which had the most influence on SseB levels in the cell .
An unmarked in - frame deletion of rpoE was then generated in S. Typhimurium strain SL1344 and we verified that this in - frame deletion had the same effect on SseB as A wt ΔrpoE ΔrpoS ΔrpoN SseB We tested the hypothesis that RpoE is involved in expression of genes that use the SsrB response regulator for activation .
By testing six promoters representing four classes of SsrB - regulated promoters ( ( i ) two type III secretion structural operons in SPI - 2 , ( ii ) the effector operon in SPI - 2 , ( iii ) two effector genes unlinked with SPI - 2 , and ( iv ) an integrated virulence gene unlinked with SPI - 2 ) we demonstrate that RpoE elicits an effect on a subset of SsrB - regulated genes .
This effect was bidirectional depending on the promoter and was downstream of ssrB expression itself , since deletion of rpoE had no effect on SsrB levels in the mutant cells .
These data help unite the virulence phenotypes of strains lacking SsrB and RpoE , and highlight new transcriptional regulation that might be essential for appropriate temporal and spatial control of the virulenceassociated type III secretion system during host infection .

( A ) wild type ( wt ) , ΔrpoE , ΔrpoS , and ΔrpoN S. Typhimurium 14028s were grown for 6 hours under SsrB - inducing conditions .
Lysates were probed by western blot for SseB , a component of the T3SS needle complex .
( B ) Western blot was performed as above and lysates probed for SseB in wild type ( wt ) S. Typhimurium SL1344 , ΔrpoE and in ΔrpoE complemented with pWSK29 carrying full length rpoE with endogenous promoters .
( C ) Wild type S. Typhimurium SL1344 and ΔrpoE cells were immunoblotted as above and lysates probed for SseL - 2HA , SrfN - 2HA and SifA - 2HA which were expressed from their endogenous promoters in pWSK29 .
Blots were probed for DnaK as a control .
The experiment was performed three times with similar results .
the rpoE : : cat mutant used previously ( Figure 1B ) .
A lowcopy plasmid containing full - length rpoE and the three endogenous promoters that can drive its expression [ 20 ] was able to restore wild type levels of SseB to ΔrpoE cells ( Figure 1B ) demonstrating that the results were specific to the rpoE deletion .
In these complementation experiments , attempts were made to examine the levels of SseB secreted into the culture supernatant [ 21 ] , however consistent with previous observations [ 22,23 ] perturbations to the rpoE pathway increased cell lysis resulting in contamination of secreted fractions with cytosolic proteins which precluded accurate interpretation ( data not shown ) .
In order to examine the effect of σ E ( rpoE ) on the expression of a broad range of SsrB - regulated virulence genes , we tested whether or not the effect of rpoE deletion was specific to sseB or if it extended to other SsrB - regulated genes .
To do this we examined the levels of SseL - 2HA , SifA - 2HA and SrfN - 2HA expressed from their endogenous promoters under SPI - 2 inducing conditions ( Figure 1C ) .
Consistent with the results for SseB , there was a decrease in SifA - 2HA levels in ΔrpoE compared to wild type , although deletion of rpoE did not have an effect on SseL - 2HA .
Relative to its expression in wild type cells , the level of SrfN - 2HA was reproducibly increased in the ΔrpoE cells , suggesting a role for σ E in the repression of SrfN , although it is unlikely that this is through a direct mechanism .
RpoE is involved in transcriptional activity of a subset of virulence genes In order to confirm the effect of σ E on the expression of a broad range of SsrB - regulated virulence genes , we used wild type and ΔrpoE cells and integrated into the chromosome individually six single - copy transcriptional - fusions representing promoters for four classes of SsrB - dependent genes or operons ( ( i ) type III secretion effector operon ( sseA ) ; ( ii ) structural operon I ( ssaB ) ; ( iii ) structural operon II ( ssaG ) ; ( iv and v ) effectors encoded outside of SPI - 2 ( sseL and sifA ) ; and ( vi ) integrated virulence genes unlinked to SPI - 2 ( srfN ) [ 9 ] .
Transcriptional fusions to lacZ of the sseA , ssaB , ssaG , sseL , sifA and srfN promoters ( mapped previously ; [ 9,24 ] were integrated into the chromosome of wild type and ΔrpoE cells and then grown in the SsrB - activating medium LPM .
The activity of each promoter was measured using a β - galactosidase assay during exponential - growth .
Although ΔrpoE was observed to have a slightly prolonged lag phase relative to wild type cells under these experimental conditions , at later time points the mutant grew similarly to wild type .
To account for any differences in growth kinetics of the cultures , all data was normalized to the optical density at 600 nm of the culture , which permitted direct comparisons .
In wild type cells , promoter activity from all the transcriptional fusions was high , as expected , because LPM medium is highly inducing for SsrB activity [ 21 ] .
In contrast , promoter activity for sseA , ssaB , and sifA decreased in the rpoE mutant compared to wild type cells ( Figure 2A , B and 2D ) , whereas promoter activity from the ssaG and srfN reporters was upregulated in the rpoE mutant ( Figure 2C and 2F ) .
β - galactosidase activity observed from the sseL reporter was unaltered in the rpoE deletion compared to that in wild type cells ( Figure 2E ) .
These data are consistent with the protein levels detected for these gene products .
Together , these data indicate that σ E can have a variable and bidirectional effect on SsrB - regulated virulence genes .
The effect of RpoE on virulence genes is downstream of ssrB expression The variable effects of rpoE deletion on SsrB - regulated effectors suggested that RpoE might direct transcription downstream of ssrB expression .
To test this , we replaced the ssrB gene in ΔrpoE and wild type cells with an ssrB : : FLAG allele [ 19 ] and examined the levels of SsrB protein in the strains by western blot .
There was no change in the levels of SsrB - FLAG between wild type and ΔrpoE cells ( Figure 3 ) , indicating that the effects of RpoE on the four classes of virulence gene promoters examined here was not mediated through changes to SsrB protein levels .
Together these data establish a role for RpoE in the finetuning of virulence gene expression in S. Typhimurium .
Discussion In this work we found that the alternative sigma factor , σ E , is involved in fine tuning the expressing of a subset of SsrB - regulated virulence genes required for Salmonella pathogenesis .
Wild type and ΔrpoE cells carrying single - copy chromosomal transcriptional reporters of ( A ) P sseA : : pP sseA - lacZ , ( B ) P ssaB : : pP ssaB - lacZ , ( C ) P ssaG : : pP ssaG - lacZ , ( D ) P sifA : : pP sifA - lacZ , ( E ) P sseL : : pP sseL - lacZ and ( F ) P srfN : : pP srfN - lacZ were grown in LPM ( pH - 5.8 ) .
At the indicated time β - galactosidase activity was measured and expressed as relative light units ( RLU ) normalized to optical density of the culture .
Wild type and ΔrpoE cells lacking the transcriptional reporters were used as controls in each experiment .
Data are the means with standard error from triplicate determinations from three independent experiments .

This integration may help Salmonella coordinate expression of the virulence - associated T3SS in response to host factors that compromise bacterial membrane integrity ( Figure 4 ) .
This mechanism would activate a restorative σ E pathway , which is consistent with the enhanced susceptibility of rpoE mutants to oxidative - stress and antimicrobial peptides [ 13,15,16 ] , both of which perturb membrane integrity in - vivo .
Although there is no evidence that σ E can directly repress transcription , the negative effect on two promoters observed here might be due to an intermediate RpoE - regulated repressor or compensatory effect where loss of rpoE increases the relative abundance of another sigma factor that can directly activate the ssaG and srfN promoters .
Future work will be required to resolve these possibilities .
The ssrAB Figure effect expression 3 of RpoE on SsrB - regulated genes is downstream of The effect of RpoE on SsrB - regulated genes is downstream of ssrAB expression .
The ssrB gene in wild type and ΔrpoE cells was replaced with an ssrB - FLAG allele in its native location on the chromosome .

fitness in a host animal [ 25 ] .
In cases where the regulator is deleted , the loss of genetic fine - tuning causes incongruous changes in the timing and magnitude of virulence gene expression , leading to fitness loss and strong attenuation .
We predict that RpoE confers a similar fine - tuning effect on Salmonella virulence gene expression that is required for optimal within - host fitness during infection .
When we examined the -10 and -35 positions of the promoters studied here relative to the transcriptional start sites identified previously [ 24 ] , these promoters did not appear to contain σ E consensus sequences .
Instead they appeared to have consensus sites for σ 70 .
Although a bioinformatics screen identified σ E consensus sequences upstream of the SPI - 2 genes ssaU , ssaJ , sscA and ssaC [ 26 ] , these genes were not tested for σ E - dependence in the present study because the identified consensus sites are in coding sequence within operons , and as a result may not be directly relevant .
Due to the high degree of conservation in σ factor binding sequences , σ E may not be directly regulating SsrB - dependent promoters .
The lack of a canonical σ E sequence at these promoters suggests that Our results indicate that rpoE deletion has no effect on SsrB levels under SPI - 2 inducing conditions suggesting that the σ E pathway regulates effector expression downstream of ssrAB transcription .
Unlinking ssrAB transcription from the σ E regulon would be advantageous to the cell to prevent commitment to a virulence gene expression program in response to envelope stress not associated with infection .
The results from this study demonstrate that σ E has the ability to affect expression of SsrB - regulated virulence genes and offers potential insight into the virulence attenuation of rpoE mutants .
Although when considered individually , each promoter was modestly affected by deletion of rpoE , the cumulative effects of mild rewired inputs on multiple virulence promoters has been shown to severely compromise in - host fitness and virulence ability [ 25 ] .
Conclusion Based on these and other data [ 4,12 - 15 ] , the genetic interaction between σ E and a subset of SsrB - regulated genes may serve to coordinate the spatial and temporal activation of virulence genes in a host setting , likely in response to membrane damage resulting from oxidative antimicrobial systems and membrane - targeted host defence peptides .

Membrane - targeting host defences including reactive oxygen stress and antimicrobial peptides cause an accumulation of unfolded outer membrane proteins ( OMPs ) and stimulate the cleavage of the anti - sigma factor RseA consequently releasing σ E into the cytoplasm where it directs RNA polymerase to a subset of SPI - 2 promoters .
RpoE can positively or negatively regulate SsrB - regulated genes including integrated virulence genes unlinked with SPI - 2 but has no effect on some effector genes such as sseL .
This regulatory pathway may have evolved to coordinate virulence gene expression with host infection by responding to host - specific defence pathways that perturb the bacterial outer membrane .

Mutants were screened for loss of rpoE using primers BKC193 and BKC194 .
