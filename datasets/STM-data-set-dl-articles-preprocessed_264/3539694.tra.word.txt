CHARACTERIZATION OF PROMOTER AND OPERATOR MUTATIONS DONALD R. HAHN AND STANLEY R. MALOY Department of Microbiology , University of Illinois , Urbana , Illinois 61801 Manuscript received January 7 , 1986 Revised copy accepted July 21 , 1986 ABSTRACT The two genes required for proline utilization by S. typhimurium form a divergent operon .
Expression of the put operon is induced by proline and subject to catabolite - repression .
Genetic evidence suggests that putA protein autogenously represses transcription of the PutA and putP genes .
In order to establish the molecular mechanism of put operon regulation we isolated regulatory mutations in the put control region .
These mutants were selected using two phenotypes : ( 1 ) the ability to degrade a toxic proline analogue , dehydroproline , due to overexpression of putA enzyme activity , or ( 2 ) overexpression of lac2 from put : : Mud operon fusions .
The effect of each mutation on transcription in both directions was determined by measuring lac2 expression from PutA and putP operon fusions .
These regulatory mutations were cis - dominant when the putA protein was provided in trans , and they map in a region between the two genes .
The phenotypes of the mutants suggest that ( 1 ) the put regulatory region has a single operator site where the putA protein binds to repress transcription in both directions , and ( 2 ) the putA and putP promoters overlap .
HE put operon encodes two proteins required for the utilization of ex - T ogenous proline as a carbon and nitrogen source .
The putP gene encodes the primary proline permease , and the putA gene encodes a bifunctional membrane - associated enzyme that catalyzes the two - step degradation of proline to glutamate ( RATZKIN and ROTH 1978 ) .
Expression of the put operon is induced by proline and subject to catabolite - repression ( RATZKIN and ROTH 1978 ; MALOY and ROTH 1983 ) .
The putA protein is also involved in the regulation of the putP and putA genes .
Genetic evidence for the regulatory role of the putA protein was based on the phenotypes of putA mutants ( MENZEL and ROTH 1981a ) .
Nonsense and insertion mutations in the putA gene result in both the loss of enzymatic activity of the putA protein and constitutive expression of the putP gene product .
Some missense mutations that map in the putA gene , putA ( A - C + ) , cause loss of enzymatic activity ( A - ) but do not eliminate control of the putP gene ( C + ) .
Other missense mutations , putA ( A+C - ) , retain enzymatic activity but express both the putA and putP genes constitutively .
Studies with operon fusions demonstrated Genetics 114 : 687 - 703 November , 1986 688 D. R. HAHN AND S. R. MALOY that the PutA protein negatively regulates transcription of the put genes ( MA - LOY and ROTH 1983 ) .
Based on these genetic studies , the following model has been proposed for regulation of the put operon ( MENZEL and ROTH 1981a ; MALOY and ROTH 1983 ) .
When a high concentration of proline is present , the PutA protein binds proline , which promotes association with the cytoplasmic membrane , where it is enzymatically active .
However , when no exogenous proline is available , the PutA protein accumulates in the cytoplasm , where it binds the DNA and represses transcription of the put genes .
Biochemical evidence also supports this model : proline is required for purified PutA protein to bind to membrane vesicles in - vitro ( GRAHAM , STEPHENSON and WOOD 1984 ) , and the putA protein is a DNA binding protein in - vitro and in - vivo ( G. SZYMSKI and S. MALOY , unpublished results ) .
All previously isolated mutations that affect regulation of the put operon map in the putA structural gene .
A thorough understanding of the regulation of the put operon requires the isolation and characterization of cis - dominant regulatory mutations that map in the control region .
MALOY and ROTH ( 1983 ) demonstrated that the PutA and PutP genes are transcribed divergently .
Thus , the DNA binding sites involved in regulation of the put operon would be expected to map in the region between the two genes .
Some cis - dominant regulatory mutants can be directly selected .
To isolate other classes of cisdominant mutations we used put : : Mud operon fusions that place the lac operon under the control of the put promoters .
Use of operon fusions allowed selection of put control mutants using the Lac phenotype .
This paper describes the isolation and characterization of four classes of cis - dominant mutations that overexpress PutA , PutP or both genes .
Based on available genetic evidence , a structure for the put regulatory region is proposed .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains : All bacterial strains used in this study are derivatives of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 .
The genotypes of the strains used are shown in Table 1 .
Media and growth - conditions : Difco nutrient broth supplemented with 0.5 % NaCl was used for rich media .
E medium with citrate was used for minimal media ( VOGEL and BONNER 1956 ) .
Since S. typhimurium can use citrate as a carbon source , citrate - free E medium ( NCE ) was used when selecting for growth on a sole carbon source ( MALOY and ROTH 1983 ) .
Minimal media was supplemented with succinate at 0.6 % or other carbon sources at 0.2 % .
E medium and NCE medium contain ammonium as the nitrogen source .
When growth on proline as a sole nitrogen source ( PSN ) was selected , NCN medium ( 40 mM KH2P04 , 80 mM K2HP04 ) with 0.2 % proline and 0.6 % succinate was used .
Sugars were added to 1 % in Macconkey agar base ( Difco ) .
Proline TTC indicator plates were described by MENZEL and ROTH ( 1981a ) .
Antibiotics were added to rich media at the following concentrations : 20 pg/ml tetracycline hydrochloride , 50 pg/ml kanamycin sulfate and 25 pg/ml sodium ampicillin .
Tetracycline was added to minimal medium at 10 pg/ml .
Effective concentration of proline analogues vary with the growth conditions .
In this study , analogues were added to NCE succinate medium : azetidine - 2 - carboxylic acid was added at 27 yg/ml , and 3,4 - dehydroproline was added at 12 pg / ml .
Leucyl - proline was added to NCN + dextrose plates at a concentration of 10 mg / ml .
Nomenclature OF Mud derivatives is described in the MATERIALS AND METHODS .
alized transducing phage that can not form stable lysogens ( SCHMIEGER 1972 ; SANDER - SON and ROTH 1983 ) , was used for all transductions .
Phage lysates were prepared as described by DAVIS , BOTSTEIN and ROTH ( 1980 ) .
Bacteria were infected with phage at 690 D. R. HAHN AND S. R. MALOY a multiplicity of approximately one plaque - forming unit per cell .
Usually , cells and phage were mixed directly on selective media .
When kanamycin resistance was selected or selective plates contained ethylene glycol bis - N , N , N ' , N ' - tetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) , cells and phage were spread on nutrient agar plates , incubated 4 - 8 hr and replica - plated onto selective media .
Transductants were streaked on green indicator plates ( CHAN et al. 1972 ) then cross - streaked against the clear plaque mutant P22 H5 to check for phage sensitivity ( DAVIS , BOTSTEIN and ROTH 1980 ) .
Except where noted , MS187 ( pyrD15/F ` ts 601 put + TnlO ) was the donor for all conjugations .
MS187 was constructed by the conjugational cross of TT1857 ( proAB47 srl - 201 put - 544 / F ' 601 put + TnlO ) with pyrDI5 .
Matings with temperature - sensitive F ' plasmids were done directly on selective media at 30 '' ( MILLER 1972 ) .
Nomenclature of operon fusions : Due to the complexity of Mud nomenclature , the simplified nomenclature suggested by K. T. HUGHES and J. R. ROTH ( unpublished results ) is used in this paper .
All the operon fusions used in this study were constructed with Mudl - 8 or MudIl734 .
Mudl - 8 is a derivative of Mudl ( Amp , lac ) that has amber mutations in the transposition functions ( HUGHES and ROTH 1985 ) .
Mudl - 8 is designated MudA .
MudIl734 is a derivative of Mudl that has been deleted for transposition functions and carries Kan ' instead of Amp ' ( BEATRIZ , OLFSON and CASADABAN 1984 ) .
Mudl1734 is designated MudJ .
Construction of operon fusions : Operon fusions of MudA with the put genes were isolated as described by HUGHES and ROTH ( 1985 ) .
Random Amp ' insertions of MudA in strain TT7610 ( supD ) were screened for inability to grow on proline as a sole nitrogen source ( PSN - ) .
The PSN - MudA insertion mutants were transduced into LT2 ( supD ' ) with P22 , selecting for Amp ' .
MudA insertions transpose at a low frequency in supD ' background ( cl % ) .
All of the PSN - mutants obtained mapped in the put genes , as determined by deletion mapping .
Because of the large size of MudA ( 37.5 kb ) , P22 transduction of a complete put : : MudA fusion occurs at a low frequency ( HUGHES and ROTH 1985 ) .
Therefore , MudJ ( 11.3 kb ) fusions were used for some studies .
To obtain MudJ insertions in the put genes , P22 grown on strain TT10286 ( hisD9953 : : MudJ ) was used to transduce MS1513 ( putAIOl9 : : MudA ) and MS1515 ( putPIOZ4 : : MudA ) to Kan ' on minimal plates .
The Kan ' colonies were screened for growth on PSN and NB + Amp plates .
The Kan ' Amps PSN - isolates resulted from conversion of MudA insertions to MudJ insertions by homologous recombination between the Mu and lac sequences of MudA and MudJ ( K. T. HUGHES and J. R. ROTH , unpublished results ) .
In each case the MudJ insertion mapped in the same position as the original MudA insertion .
Localized mutagenesis : P22 lysates of TTl797 ( zcc - 7 : : TnlO ) , MSl209 ( putP : : MudJ ) or MSl210 ( putA : : MudJ ) were mutagenized with hydroxylamine in - vitro ( HONG and AMES 1971 ; DAVIS , BOTSTEIN and ROTH 1980 ) .
The phage lysates were concentrated 100 - fold , resuspended in sterile LBSE ( LB with 1 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA ) , and hydroxylamine was added to 0.4 M .
This mixture was incubated at 37 '' .
Samples of the phage lysates were removed every 4 - 8 hr and were titered on LT2 .
When the phage survival reached 0.1 % ( 26 - 30 hr ) , the samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 2 hr to pellet the phage .
The phage pellet was gently resuspended in 1 ml of LBSE .
In our experiments , approximately I - 2 % of the surviving phage were clear plaque mutants , indicating a level of mutagenesis that would yield less than one mutation per gene ( HONG and AMES 1971 ) .
LT2 was transduced to drug resistance with the mutagenized phage stocks , and the transductants were screened for put mutants .
Other strain constructions : The cyu and crp derivatives of Mud fusion strains were constructed as follows .
MS15 14 ( putA : : MudA ) and MS15 16 ( putP : MudA ) were transduced to Tet ' with P22 lysates grown on PP1002 ( cyu : : TnlO ) or PP1037 ( crp : : TnIO ) .
The Tet ' transductants formed white colonies on Macconkey medium + ribose + glycerol as expected for cyu and crp mutants ( ALPER and AMES 1978 ) .
Since second site revertants of cya mutants are common ( P. POSTMA , personal communication ) , all mutations in cyu or crp backgrounds were stored frozen .
Each time a cya or crp mutant put REGULATORY MUTATIONS 69 1 was defrosted it was checked out on Macconkey + ribose + glycerol medium before use .
The recA derivatives of Mud fusion strains were constructed as follows .
Strains were transduced to Tet ' with a P22 lysate grown on TT520 ( srl : : TnlO ) .
The progeny , which were unable to use Sorbitol as a sole carbon source ( Srl - ) , were transduced to Srl + with P22 grown in TR5422 ( srP recAl ) .
The Srl + transductants were screened for UV sensitivity to determine if they had coinherited the recA mutation .
About 50 % of the Srl + transductants ( 23 of 47 ) were highly sensitive to UV light , indicating they coinherited the recA mutation .
Enzyme assays : & Galactosidase was assayed using the chloroform - SDS permeabilization procedure described by MILLER ( 1972 ) .
/ 3 - Galactosidase activity is expressed as nanomoles per minute per ODsso '' , .
The PutA protein was purified from LT2 , and proline oxidase was assayed as described by MENZEL and ROTH ( 1 981 b ) .
RESULTS Selection for mutants that affect expression of operon fusions : Cis - dominant mutations that affect expression of putA or putP are difficult to select directly .
Also , many structural gene mutants in put have phenotypes similar to put promoter mutants .
Therefore , we used put : : Mud operon fusion strains to isolate promoter mutations in plt .
These operon fusions place the lac2 gene under transcriptional control of the putA or PutP promoter .
To reduce the frequency of obtaining put structural gene mutations that would be polar on lad , we used MudJ insertions that map near the promoter of putA or putP but are still regulated normally when put '' is provided in trans .
The putP operon fusion MS1209 ( putP : : MudJ ) normally forms pink colonies on Macconkey + lactose plates .
LT2 was transduced to Kan ' with hydroxylamine mutagenized P22 phage grown on MS1209 .
Mutants that overexpress lac2 from the putP promoter formed dark red colonies on Macconkey + lactose plates .
These mutants , obtained at a frequency of 0.5 % , include potential putP promoter up mutations ( PutPp ) .
White ( Lac - ) colonies were obtained at a frequency of 20 % .
However all the Lac - mutants isolated were due to mutations in the lac genes or mutations in the putP structural gene , so they were not examined further .
Cis - dominant promoter mutations in the putA gene were isolated using the same strategy as described above .
LT2 was transduced to Kan ' on Macconkey + lactose plates with hydroxylamine - mutagenized P22 grown on MS 12 10 ( 9utA : : MudJ ) .
This MudJ insertion maps in the first deletion interval of the putA gene and is regulated normally .
Dark red colonies , potentially due to promoter up mutations ( PutAp ) , appeared at a frequency of 0.2 % .
Approximately 20 % of the transductants formed white ( Lac - ) colonies , but all of the mutants tested were lac or put structural gene mutations .
Isolation of CAMP - CRP independant mutants : Full expression of the put operon requires CAMP - CRP complex .
Hence , the put operon has only residual activity when glucose is the carbon source ( RATZKIN and ROTH 1978 ; MALOY and ROTH 1983 ) .
We used two methods to isolate put mutants that are not subject to catabolite - repression .
When putA : : Mud fusion strains carry a cya : : TnlO or crp : : TnlO mutation , they grow slowly and can not utilize glycerol , ribose or lactose on Macconkey plates .
Strains MS 1519 ( putA : : MudA 692 D. R. HAHN AND S. R. MALOY crp : : TnZO ) and MS1517 ( putA : : MudA cyu : : TnlO ) were grown overnight in nutrient broth , then 10 ' cells were plated on NCE + lactose plates .
Spontaneous Lac + mutants were obtained at a frequency of lom6 .
A total of 20 catabolite repression - resistant mutants ( putAp ' ) were studied in detail .
All of the mutants selected were Tet ' and unable to use glycerol or ribose , as expected for c y and crp mutants ( ALPER and AMES 1978 ) .
Catabolite - repression of the putP gene was not strong enough to use this method to isolate analogous mutants with putP : : Mud fusion strains .
Both MSl520 ( putP : : MudA crp : : TnlO ) and MS1518 ( putP : : MudA cyu : : TnlO ) grew on NCE + lactose medium .
Mutants in put that could use proline as a sole nitrogen source in the presence of glucose were previously isolated from EMS mutagenized cells ( NEWELL and BRILL 1972 ) .
We also isolated CAMP - CRP independent mutants directly from nitrosoguanidine [ NG ] - mutagenized LT2 that was plated on NCN + glucose + proline or NCN + glucose + leucyl - proline medium .
Leucyl - proline can be utilized independent of putP gene expression , in contrast to utilization of proline that requires expression of both the putA and putP genes .
Six NGgenerated mutants that grew on NCN + glucose + leucyl - proline and 18 NGgenerated mutants that grew on NCN + glucose + proline were examined further .
Analogue sensitivity of the mutants and @ - galactosidase activity in putP or putA Mud operon fusions were measured .
Each mutant had a phenotype similar to the catabolite - repression - resistant mutants ( putApc ) described above .
The two mutations that were mapped ( put - 1147 and put - 1148 ) both mapped in the same two deletion intervals as the putAp ' mutants .
Analogue sensitivity of put mutants : The put mutants can be grouped based on the ability to use proline as a sole nitrogen source and on sensitivity of the mutants to the proline analogues azetidine - 2-carboxylic acid ( AZT ) and 3,4 - dehydroproline ( DHP ) .
AZT and DHP are transported into the cell by the putP gene product ( TRISTRAM and NEALE 1963 ) .
When incorporated into cell protein , both analogues are toxic to the cell ( FOWDER and RICHMOND 1963 ) .
At the concentrations used in this study , LT2 is sensitive to both AZT and DHP ( Table 2 , line a ) .
The phenotypes of put mutants on these analogues is shown in Table 2 .
Null mutations in the putP gene prevent transport of proline , AZT and DHP ( Table 2 , line b ) .
Three types of putA mutants can be distinguished by their phenotypes : ( 1 ) putA ( A - C - ) mutants are defective for the putA enzymes and constitutive for PutP expression .
Constitutive expression of putP makes these mutants supersensitive to AZT and DHP ( Table 2 , line c ) .
( 2 ) putA ( A - C + ) mutants are defective for putA enzymatic activity and are therefore PSN - .
However , the putA ( A - C + ) mutants are less sensitive to AZT and DHP than null alleles because the putP gene is regulated ( Table 2 , line d ) .
( 3 ) putA ( A+C - ) mutants express both the putP transport and putA enzymatic functions constitutively .
These mutants are supersensitive to AZT , but not to DHP ( Table 2 , line e ) .
Mutants that are deleted for the entire put operon ( PutPA ) are PSN - and AZT '' , but remain sensitive to DHP ( Table 2 , line f ) .
The sensitivity to DHP is due to transport by a second proline permease encoded by the prop gene ( CSONKA 1982 ) .

volved in resistance to DHP .
The putP - A - mutants are sensitive to DHP , yet putP - A + mutants are resistant to DHP .
Furthermore , putA ( A+C - ) mutants are resistant to DHP although they express the putP permease constitutively .
These results suggest that the putA protein can convert DHP to a nontoxic product , but can not act on AZT .
Biochemical evidence confirms that DHP is a substrate for the purified PutA protein in - vitro .
The K , of proline oxidase for proline is 80 mM , and the K , for DHP is 40 mM .
In contrast , AZT is not oxidized by the putA protein .
Promoter up mutants can be distinguished from the wild type by their sensitivity to proline analogues .
However , in order to study analogue sensitivity , the mutations had to be moved into a background without put insertion mutations .
The cis - dominant putpp mutations were moved into a new background as shown in Figure 1 .
Deletion put - 570 , which removes the put control region as well as the entire putA structural gene , was transduced to PSN + with P22 grown on the promoter up mutants ( Figure 1A ) .
Since the central control region of the put operon is deleted in the recipient , all PSN + transductants received the put control region DNA from the mutants .
The PSN + transductants ( Figure 1B ) are supersensitive to AZT on radial streaks ( Table 2 , line i ) , indicating that the putP gene is overexpressed .
The PutP promoter up mutants are less sensitive to DHP relative to AZT than is LT2 , indicating that PutA is also overexpressed in these mutants .
Mutants that overexpress putA are more resistant to DHP than the wild type ; 694 D. R. HAHN AND S. R. MALOY A a ( Kan Lac 1 + 4put - 570 B 4 ) select PSN + 0 grow ~ 22 C I put - 557 r D 0 select Lac + FIGURE 1 .

( See text for details on the genetic crosses and deletion mapping .
) Open boxes represent deletions ; crosshatched boxes represent Mud insertions ; arrows indicate orientation of Mud insertions required for expression from the put promoters .
therefore , PutAp mutants should be DHP ' .
When the PutAp putA : : Mud mutants were transduced with P22 ( LT2 ) to DHP ' , KanS PSN + was coinherited , indicating that the Mud mutants had been crossed out .
These PutA promoter up mutants were resistant to AZT also ( Table 2 , line j ) .
These mutations increase the efficiency of PutA promoter activity , but are still induced by proline .
This is potentially due to an increased level of putA protein in the cytoplasm that leads to increased repression of putP expression and analogue resistance .
The spontaneous PutAp ' putA : : Mud mutants overexpress PutA independent of catabolite - repression .
These mutations should allow - growth of cells with an intact PutA structural gene on NCN + glucose + proline , whereas LT2 grows slowly on NCN 4 - glucose + proline and forms very small colonies .
The putAp ' putA : : Mud mutants were transduced with P22 ( LT2 ) , and growth on PSN was selected .
PSN + transductants were replica - plated onto NCN + glucose + proline plates , and two colony types were observed .
Large fast - growing colonies , put REGULATORY MUTATIONS 695 obtained at a frequency of about lo % , were selected as putApc mutants .
The CAMP - CRP independent putA mutants are supersensitive to AZT , but are resistant to DHP ( Table 2 , line k ) .
The increase in putA enzymatic activity and putP permease activity suggests that these mutations decrease putA protein repression of both the PutA and PutP genes .
The CAMP - CRP independent mutants are referred to as putAp ' because they overexpress the putA gene and express the put operon constitutively .
The absolute level of analogue resistance differed among different mutant isolates .
Isolation of analogue - resistant mutants : MENZEL and ROTH ( 1 98 la ) isolated putA constitutive mutants that alter the PutA structural gene by screening mutagenized cells for AZT supersensitive ( AZT '' ) mutants .
We found that these putA ( A+C - ) mutants are more resistant to DHP than the wild type ( Table 2 , line e ) .
Therefore , we used the DHP ' phenotype to screen for put constitutive mutants .
LT2 was transduced to Tet ' with hydroxylamine - mutagenized P22 grown on TT1797 ( put ' zcc - 7 : : TnlO ) .
The TnlO insertion in this strain is 80 % cotransducible with the put operon .
The Tet ' transductants were screened for analogue sensitivity on replica plates containing DHP and AZT .
Twenty - one PSN + , DHP ' , AZTs mutants were chosen for further characterization ( Table 2 , line I ) .
Transcriptional control of cisdominant mutants : @ - Galactosidase activity of put operon fusion strains was assayed in parallel with merodiploid strains that carry a second copy of the put operon on a F ' plasmid .
As shown previously , ( MALOY and ROTH 1983 ) , haploid putA : : Mud fusions express lac at a high constitutive level , but when putA + is provided in trans , expression of lac is regulated by proline ( Table 3 , lines a and c ) .
This is the expected result for an operon fusion in an autoregulated gene .
Haploid putP : Mud fusions are only slightly induced by proline , but when PutP ' is provided in trans , expression of lac is induced by proline ( Table 3 , lines b and d ) .
This is apparently due to inducer exclusion in haploid putP mutants ( MALOY and ROTH 1983 ) .
In the merodiploid strains , both promoters were induced two - to fourfold by proline .
Transcription from both put promoters is also subject to catabolite repression ( Table 3 , lines a , b , c and d ) .
Transcription of putA : : Mud fusions was sevenfold lower when grown under catabolite repressed conditions than when CAMP is present .
Transcription from the putP promoter was activated by CAMP - CRP complex to a lesser extent than putA .
Furthermore , the putP gene was expressed at a low constitutive level in the presence of cya or crp mutations , whereas the putA gene was not expressed in the same background ( data not shown ) .
While regulation of different put : : lac operon fusions is qualitatively similar , the absolute levels of lac2 expression vary in different fusions ( MALOY and ROTH 1983 ) .
Therefore , comparison of the absolute B - galactosidase levels were made only in isogenic derivatives of the same Mud fusion .
The effects of the cis - dominant mutations on transcription of the PutP and PutA genes are described below .
putP promoter up mutations : Expression of lac2 in the putpp putP : : Mud mutants was catabolite - repressed and negatively controlled by the wild - type put operon in trans .
When fully induced , the putpp putP : : Mud strains expressed TABLE 3 Effect of put promoter mutants on transcription & Galactosidase activity '' of strains grown on Induction ratiob Glu - Glu - Glu - cose Glu - cose cose + Pro - + Pro + CAMP No .
All assays were done in triplicate and were repeated on at least two independent occasions .
When indicated , cAMP was added to a final concentration of 5 mM .
b Induction ratios were determined by dividing fully induced activity by activity without inducer as follows : -- -- + Pro Glu + Pro + CAMP .
+ CAMP Glu + Pro + cAMP - - Pro Glu + AMP ' - CAMP - Glu + Pro ' ' & Galactosidase activity of putPlU23 : : MudA recAl and putPlU23 : : MudA recAl/F ` put + was identical to the recA + parent shown on line b. put REGULATORY MUTATIONS 697 lac2 at two - to fourfold higher levels than putP : : Mud fusions with the wildtype promoter ( Table 3 , line f ) .
The effects of putP promoter up mutations on PutA transcription were examined after the mutations were moved into a putA : : Mud background , as shown in Figure 1C .
Strain MS1006 ( Aput - 557 putA : : MudA ) is Lac - due to a deletion that removes the entire promoter region of the putA and PutP genes .
MS1006 was transduced to Lac + with P22 grown on the putpp ( PSN + AZT '' ) mutants .
All Lac + transductants received the promoter DNA from the mutant donors ( Figure 1D ) .
Transcription of lac2 in the putpp putA : : Mud derivatives was not catabolite - repressed .
When putA protein was provided in trans , lac2 was expressed constitutively at about twofold higher than fully induced wild - type levels ( Table 3 , line e ) .
These putpp mutants were cis - dominant and affect transcription in both directions .
putA promoter up mutants : Expression of lac2 from putAp putA : : Mud mutants was catabolite - repressed and repressed by putA protein in trans ( Table 3 , line g ) .
Basal levels of @ - galactosidase from PutAp mutants were comparable to wild - type levels , and fully induced expression was two - to threefold higher than normal .
This suggests that these mutants only affect RNA polymerase binding , and not PutA protein or CAMP - CRP interactions at the promoter .
Effects of putAp mutations on PutP expression were measured after MS12 1 1 ( Aput - 557 putP : : MudA ) was transduced to Lac + with P22 lysates of putAp ( PSN + DHP ' ) mutants .
This cross is similar to that shown in Figure 1C .
Haploid , putAp putP : : Mud mutants were not regulated by proline due to inducer exclusion , but expression of lac2 in the putAp putP : : Mud mutants was regulated by CAMP - CRP and putA protein in trans ( Table 3 , line h ) .
In the putAp putP : : Mud/F ` put + merodiploid , basal levels were more than fivefold lower than wild type , and when fully induced , expression was only one - half of wild type .
This confirms radial streak data suggesting that the put operon in these mutants is superrepressed by putA protein .
When a F ' put ' plasmid was brought into putAp mutants with either a putA : : Mud or putP : : Mud , the strains underwent homogenotization at a high frequency .
About 30 % ( 83 of 275 ) of the exconjugants converted to the chromosomal phenotype ( Put - , Lac + Kan ' ) and 70 % ( 193 of 276 ) converted to the phenotype of the plasmid ( Put ' Lac - Kan ' ) .
All converted strains retained the ability to mate the F ' into a suitable recipient .
The homogenotization was recAdependent , so merodiploid analysis of these mutants was done in strains with a recA mutation .
Expression of @ - galactosidase in the catabolite - repression - resistant mutants ( putApc ) was found to be two - to eightfold higher than the fully induced wildtype putA : : Mud operon fusions .
This activity was constitutive when wild - type putA protein was provided in trans and was unaffected by exogenous CAMP when cells were grown on glucose ( Table 3 , line i and k ) .
P22 lysates grown on PSN + derivates of these strains were used to transduce MS1211 ( Aput - 557 putP : : MudA ) to Lac + .
Every putApc putP : : Mud mutant assayed expressed PutP constitutively at almost fully induced wild - type levels ( Table 3 , lines j and 1 ) .
Only one PutAp ' mutant assayed retained some catabolite - repression of PutP 698 D. R. HAHN AND S. R. MALOY expression ( putAlll2 ; Table 3 , line I ) .
The PutAp ' mutants were cis - acting on transcription in both directions .
put operator mutations : Operon fusion derivatives of PutPAo ( DHP ' AZT '' ) mutants were constructed by transducing MS 1006 ( Aput - 557 putA : : MudA ) to Lac + with P22 lysates of the mutants ( Figure 2C ) .
Fourteen Lac + derivatives were assayed for @ - galactosidase activity with the PutA protein provided in trans .
All of these mutants expressed lac2 constitutively .
These cisdominant constitutive mutants ( PutPAo ) fell into two classes , based on levels of @ - galactosidase activity in putA : : Mud fusions .
Eight class - I mutants , represented by putPAoll29 ( Table 3 , line m ) , were no longer catabolite - repressed , and they expressed putA constitutively at 1 - 2 times the wild - type - induced levels ( Table 3 , line a ) .
Six class - I1 mutants , similar to putPAoll30 and putPAoll32 , were still catabolite - repressed , but were expressed constitutively five - to tenfold higher than normal ( Table 3 , line o and 4 ) .
The effect of these mutations on putP gene expression was determined by moving the mutations next to a putP : : Mud insertion .
This was done by transducing MSl211 ( Aput - 557 putP : MudA ) to Lac + with P22 grown on the putPAo ( PSN + DHP '' ) mutants .
Expression of lac2 from the putPAo putP : : Mud mutants was not induced by proline when the putA protein was provided in trans .
This indicates that both classes are cis - dominant constitutive for lac2 expression .
Class I mutants expressed putP at wild - type levels ( Table 3 , line n ) , and only one of four retained catabolite - repression of putP transcription .
Three mutants from class I1 expressed putP constitutively and were not catabolite - repressed ( Table 3 , line r ) .
The other class I1 mutant retained catabolite - repression of putP transcription , but was expressed approximately threefold lower than wild type ( Table 3 , line p ) .
Each point mutation caused constitutive expression of both putP and PutA .
These results suggest there is a single operator site ; therefore , the operator constitutive ( 0 ' ) mutants are referred to as putPAo .
Deletion mapping : The map position of the put promoter and operator mutants was determined by mapping against deletions that remove part of the central region between the putP and putA genes .
The deletions are PSN - .
Each deletion was transduced with P22 grown on a promoter mutant , selecting for PSN ' then screening the transductants for the phenotype of the original mutation ( RATZKIN and ROTH 1978 ) .
This scheme of indirect deletion mapping requires an estimate of the frequency of recombination between a put deletion and a mutation that maps very close to the deletion endpoint .
For these controls we used LT2 ( put ' ) and MS1535 ( putPl133 ) , which has a null point mutation in the putP gene .
A transductional cross of P22 ( LT2 ) and P22 ( putPI 133 ) with put - 594 was done to determine approximate recombination frequency for deletion mapping .
The mutation putPZI33 maps in a deletion interval adjacent to the endpoint of put - 594 .
The cross with putP1133 yielded 4 - 10 % as many PSN + transductants as when LT2 was used as the donor .
A similar cross with a PSN + promoter up mutant that maps very close to put - ZI33 yields PSN + transductants at the same frequency as LT2 .
However , the wild - type phenotype would be inherited only 4 - 10 % of the time because this requires a crossover between the promoter mutation and the deletion put REGULATORY MUTATIONS 699 Tn5 i 852 837 i 838 I I insertiom I 0 1 ii34P / I48 / i47 / / 32 i / l33 ~ / / 2 / 1726 ~ / / i3 / / I6 ii3 / i / / i2 il30 point mutations j l/25p / I22 j / / 23 ~ / / lo ili5 1/28 1 / I / / ll29 N46 ~ I 4 I I I I 8 I I I I 4 I I 1 I I put470 I put - 594 I , I put - 557 1 FIGURE 2. - Partial deletion map of the put operon .
The horizontal lines at the bottom of the figure represent the region absent in the deletion mutants put - 715 , put - 563 , put - 570 , put - 594 , and put - 557 .
All mutations isolated in this study mapped in four deletion intervals , shown here enlarged from the center of the put genetic map .
Within each deletion interval ( indicated by vertical dashed lines ) alleles are grouped by phenotype .
Polar structural gene mutations are marked with a P ( putP ) or an A ( putA ) .
The genotype of each mutant allele is as follows : putAp mutations : 1121 and 1122 ; putAp ' mutations : 1110 , 1111 , 1112 , 1113 , 1147 and 1148 : putpp mutations : 1115 and 1116 ; putPAo mutations : 1128 , 1129 , 1130 , 1131 and 1132 ; putA structural gene mutations : 1146 ; putP structural gene mutations : 1123 , 1125 , 1126 , 1133 and 1134 .
Therefore , a promoter mutant phenotype transferred to 90 - 96 % of the PSN ' transductants in a cross with a deletion strain can accurately be mapped outside the deletion present in that strain .
Promoter or operator mutations that map within a deletion interval yield 100 % mutant recombinants .
At least 500 transductants were examined from each cross .
The results of the deletion mapping are shown in Figure 2 .
DISCUSSION The put operon is transcribed divergently from a central control region ( MALOY and ROTH 1983 ) .
Protein - DNA binding studies have shown that RNA polymerase and CAMP - CRP complex ( R. MENZEL , unpublished results ) and purified putA protein ( G. SZYMSKI and S. MALOY , unpublished results ) bind to this region .
We isolated cis - dominant regulatory mutations in the control region in order to identify the regulatory sites of the put operon .
The mutants isolated in this study have defined three sites involved in regulation of the put genes .
Mutations in these three sites are described below .
The operator : Point mutations that cause full constitutive expression of the putP and putA genes were isolated .
These mutations were obtained by localized mutagenesis with hydroxylamine , selecting for overproduction of putA protein .
All of these putPAo mutations expressed both the putA and putP genes at high levels in the absence of proline .
These results suggest that there is a 700 D. R. HAHN AND S. R. MALOY single operator site : binding of the PutA protein to the operator site may repress transcription in both directions .
The operator may overlap the PutP promoter since the putPAoll30 mutation decreased the maximal transcription in the putP direction .
The operator mutations map in two central deletion intervals on the put genetic map , closely linked to PutAp ' and putpp mutations .
The putP promoter : Promoter up mutations in the PutP gene were isolated by selecting for overexpression of lac in putP : : Mud operon fusions .
These mutations ( putpp ) increase the fully induced levels of PutP transcription without a significant increase in the basal level of expression .
Regulation of PutP by proline and CAMP - CRP is retained .
These mutations seem to be due to a greater affinity of RNA polymerase for the PutP promoter .
The putpp mutations also express the putA gene constitutively , suggesting that they may overlap with either the putA promoter or the put operator .
Catabolite - repression of the PutP gene is weak compared to catabolite - repression of the putA gene .
Activation of lacZ expression by CAMP in putP : : Mud fusions is less than in putA : : Mud fusions .
Also putP : : Mud fusion strains grow on lactose in crp or cya background , whereas putA : : Mud fusion strains do not .
It is possible that there is a single binding site for CAMP - CRP complex involved in regulation of the putA gene , and the effect on the putP gene is indirect .
The putA promoter : Promoter up mutations in the putA gene were isolated by two independent schemes .
Hydroxylamine generated mutants were isolated that overexpress Euc in putA : : Mud operon fusions .
These mutants are only overexpressed under inducing conditions , and retain regulation by CAMP - CRP and putA protein .
Increased expression of the PutA protein may lead to an accumulation of the putA protein , which then represses the putP gene even in the presence of proline .
This is suggested by two observations .
First , putAp mutants are resistant to proline analogues , indicating that the putP gene is poorly expressed .
Second , @ - galactosidase expression is lower than normal in putAp putP : : Mud fusions .
Mapping data indicates that the putAp promoter mutations do not overlap with the put operator .
Spontaneous putA promoter up mutants ( PutAP ' ) were also isolated from putA : : Mud fusions strains defective in crp or cyu .
The PutAp ' mutants do not require CAMP - CRP complex for expression of the putA gene .
Such CRP - independent mutations are usually due to creation of a better promoter that does not require the activator ( RAIBAUD and SCHWARTZ 1984 ) .
Thus , these PutAp constitutive mutations may create a new promoter .
However , since the mutations express putP constitutively as well , it seems likely that they increase the activity of the PutA promoter and simultaneously reduce the binding of the putA repressor to the operator .
Based on the phenotypes of the cis - dominant put regulatory mutants and their position on the put genetic map , we propose the structure of the put control region shown in Figure 3 .
The put operon has a single operator site where the putA protein binds to repress expression of the divergent putA and putP transcripts .
The putA promoter lies to the left of the operator and initiates transcription to the right into the putA structural gene .
The putP promoter , which overlaps extensively with the operator , initiates transcription to the left into the putP structural gene .
put REGULATORY MUTATIONS - 70 1 FIGURE J. - Model for the structure of the put regulatory region .
putAP = putA promoter ; PutPp = putP promoter ; putPAo = operator for putA represser .
The divergent E. coli operons bioAsBFCD ( OTSUKA and ABELSON 1978 ; BAR - KER , KUHN and CAMPBELL 1981 ) and argE.CBH ( PIETTE et al. 1982 ) structurally resemble the model for the put promoters shown in Figure 3 .
The promoters within each regulatory region partially overlap a large imperfect palindromic operator .
Binding of RNA polymerase to one of the promoters may either exclude or enhance binding at the other promoter .
Mutations in one promoter of such divergent operons could affect the opposing promoter in an indirect way .
Therefore , promoter proximity may play an important role in the regulation and expression of put and other divergent promoters ( MCCLURE 1985 ) .
We are presently determining the DNA sequence of the wild - type put control region , and we shall soon determine the DNA sequence changes in the mutants described in this study .
In addition , we have begun isolating down mutation in the putA and putP promoters in order to firmly establish the DNA sequences required for initiation of transcription .
The DNA sequence of the regulatory mutants should indicate the exact location of the control sites .
YOUDERIAN et al. ( 1983 ) isolated mutants in the mnt repressor of P22 that repressed synthesis of ant at an ant operator containing two symmetric 0 ' mutations .
These mutant repressors no longer bind the wild - type ant operator .
Mutations in putA protein could be isolated by a similar procedure using Mud fusions and putPAo mutants .
These second site revertants may identify the DNA binding domains of the putA protein .
The use of operon fusions for isolation of promoter mutants is a very useful technique in E. coli ( BECKWITH 1981 ) and S. typhimurium .
Localized mutagenesis has not been extensively used with operon fusions , since the large Mud derivatives are transduced inefficiently ( HUGHES and ROTH 1985 ) .
In this study we isolated putP and putA promoter mutants after localized mutagenesis of mini - Mud - derived operon fusions .
Up and down regulatory mutations can be selected using lac expression .
The use of locally mutagenized mini - Mud derivatives could serve as a rapid selection technique for the isolation of promoter mutants in many systems .
Unfortunately , selection of promoter down muta - 702 D. R. HAHN AND S. R. MALOY tions is not as straightforward as selection for promoter up mutations for two reasons .
First , because it is a large target for mutagenesis , most down mutations map in the lac operon .
Second , polar mutations in the fused structural gene are also obtained .
We are presently developing specific selection and screening techniques to distinguish promoter mutations from polar and lac mutations to simplify the isolation of promoter down mutations by this technique .
