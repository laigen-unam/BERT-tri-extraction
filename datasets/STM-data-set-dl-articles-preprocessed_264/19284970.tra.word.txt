Regulation of expression of the tricarballylate utilization operon ( tcuABC ) of Salmonella enterica Jeffrey A. Lewis , Lisa W. Stamper , and Jorge C. Escalante - Semerena * Department of Bacteriology , University of Wisconsin - Madison , Madison , WI 53706 ( USA ) Abstract The tricarballylate utilization locus ( tcuRABC ) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is comprised of a 3 - gene operon ( tcuABC ) that encodes functions that allow this bacterium to use tricarballylate as a source of carbon and energy , and the tcuR gene , which encodes a putative LysRtype transcriptional regulator .
In our studies , transcription of the tcuABC operon peaked at mid - log phase , and declined moderately during stationary - phase .
This pattern was not due to a change in the amount of TcuR in the cell , as tcuR expression did not change under the conditions tested , and TcuR did not control tcuR expression .
Tricarballylate was the co - inducer .
tcuABC expression was negatively affected by the cAMP receptor protein ( Crp ) .
Expression of tcuABC was one order of magnitude higher in a crp mutant strain than in the crp + strain ; derepression of tcuABC expression was also observed in a strain lacking adenylate cyclase ( Cya ) .
At present , it is unclear whether the effect of Crp is direct or indirect .
Studies with molecular mimics of tricarballylate showed that the co - inducer site restricts binding of structural mimics that contain a hydroxyl group .
Two classes of TcuR constitutive variants were isolated .
Class I variants responded to tricarballylate , while class II did not .

Introduction Tricarballylate is a citrate analog that is considered the causative agent of grass tetany , a ruminant disease characterized by an acute hypomagnesia [ 28 ] .
Tricarballylate is not catabolized by the ruminant or the rumen flora , hence it is excreted by the animal as a magnesium chelate [ 33 ] .
Unlike the normal rumen flora , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 ( hereafter referred to as S. enterica ) can use tricarballylate as a carbon and energy source [ 18 ] .
The genome of S. enterica contains a 3 - gene operon ( tcuABC ) dedicated to tricarballylate utilization ( Fig. 4 , supplemental material ) .
The tcuABC operon contains all of the functions required for the catabolism of this tricarboxylic acid [ 24 ] .
The first gene of the operon ( tcuA ) encodes a protein with tricarballylate dehydrogenase activity , which converts tricarballyate to cis - aconitate , a Krebs cycle intermediate .
TcuA is the only enzyme needed to catabolize tricarballylate ; the tcuB and tcuC genes encode an electron transfer protein ( required 608 - 262 - 7379 , FAX : 608 - 265 - 7909 , E - mail : E - mail : escalante@bact.wisc.edu .

NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Immediately upstream of the tcuABC operon is the tcuR gene , which encodes a putative LysRtype transcriptional regulator ( LTTR ) [ 24 ] ( Fig. 4 , supplemental material ) ; tcuR is not part of the tcuABC operon .
LTTRs are among the most ubiquitous forms of transcriptional regulators , and hundreds have been found in bacteria and some archaea [ 29 ] .
LTTRs have a distinct domain architecture ( Fig. 5 , supplemental information ) , with a helix - turn - helix in their N termini [ 35 ] , while the C - terminal domains contain the co - inducer binding site and the oligomerization domain [ 1,9,11 -- 13,21,22,25,35 ] .
Here we provide in - vivo evidence that the TcuR protein uses tricarballylate as its co - inducer for transcription of the tcuABC operon , and that the catabolite - repression protein ( Crp ) negatively regulates expression of the operon .
We also report the isolation and initial characterization of mutant alleles of tcuR that encode TcuR variants that activate tcuABC expression in the absence of tricarballylate .

Expression of the tcuABC operon requires TcuR A reporter strain carrying both a tcuA : : MudJ ( lacZ + ) transcriptional - fusion and an in - frame deletion of tcuR ( strain JE9315 ) was used to assess whether TcuR was required for tcuA expression .

Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2010 April 1 .
Page 4 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript JE10458 , was transformed with either plasmid pTCU26 ( carries the wild - type tcuR + allele ) or a vector - only negative control .
Cells were grown in NCE - glycerol ( 30 mM ) ± tricarballylate ( 100 μM ) to mid - log phase ( OD 650 ~ 0.4 -- 0.5 ) .
Tricarballylate induced expression of tcuA : : MudJ ( lacZ + ) by > 22 - fold when tcuR + was provided in trans ( Table 1 ; lines 2 , 4 ) .
In contrast , we measured a 50 - fold induction of tcuA expression in strain JE7212 ( tcuA : : MudJ ( lacZ + ) , which carries a wild - type allele of tcuR on its chromosome , under the same growth conditions ( NCE - glycerol + tricarballylate ; Table 2 , lines 5 , 6 ) .
The observed differences in tricarballylate - induced tcuA expression likely reflect reduced expression of the transporter ( tcuC ) or the regulator ( tcuR ) genes .
Support for this interpretation was obtained from experiments performed in the presence of high levels of arabinose ( 10 mM ) , which led to substantially higher induction of the tcuA - lacZ fusion by tricarballylate ( 111 ± 0.5 U/OD 650 ) .
Lowering the arabinose concentration to 1 mM lowered tcuA - lacZ expression levels to 23.5 ± 3.0 U/OD 650 when cells were grown with tricarballylate , versus 7.0 ± 0.3 when cells were grown in glycerol alone .
Further lowering of the concentration of arabinose ( 0.5 mM ) in the medium led to lower expression of the tcuA - lacZ fusion ( 9.6 ± 0.6 U/OD 650 ) in medium containing tricarballylate , versus 5.8 ± 0.9 U/OD 650 for glycerol alone .
Induction by tricarballylate depended on a functional TcuC protein .
Expression of tcuA in strain JE7212 carrying the cloning vector ( pBAD30 ) did not respond to tricarballylate ( 11 ± 3 U / OD 650 in medium containing tricarballylate versus 4 ± 1 U/OD 650 in glucose alone ) .
In contrast , the same strain transformed with plasmid pTCU5 ( tcuC + ) responded to tricarballylate ( 807 ± 196 U/OD 650 in medium containing tricarballylate versus 4 ± 1 U/OD 650 in glucose alone ) .
Thus , both TcuR and TcuC functions were required for tcuABC induction by tricarballylate .
Micromolar levels of tricarballylate stimulate TcuR activity We determined how much tricarballylate was required for maximal expression of the tcuABC operon .
Strain JE7212 [ tcuA33 : : MudJ ( lacZ + ) ] was transformed with plasmid pTCU5 ( tcuC + ) , the gene that encodes the tricarballylate transporter .
A culture of the resulting strain ( JE10614 , Table 4 , supplemental material ) was grown to mid - log phase in NCE - glucose medium containing varying concentrations of tricarballylate , and β - galactosidase assays were performed .
As shown in figure 1B , as little as 12 μM tricarballylate maximally induced tcuAlacZ expression ; clearly , the cell sensed and responded to extremely low levels of of tricarballylate in the medium .
For all subsequent experiments , tricarballylate was added to 100 μM to ensure maximal tcuA - lacZ expression .
Insights into the co - inducer site of TcuR The observation that tricarballylate induced tcuA - lacZ expression in the absence of tricarballylate dehydrogenase ( TcuA ) function suggested that tricarballylate , not a catabolite of it , was the direct co - inducer of TcuR .
To gain insights into the tricarballylate binding site of TcuR in the absence of a three - dimensional structure , strain JE7212 ( tcuA33 : : MudJ ( kan + ) ) was grown on different carbon sources ( Table 2 ) .
Glucose , glycerol , citrate , isocitrate , and cis - aconitate failed to induce tcuA - lacZ expression .
Lower but substantial levels of tcuAlacZ expression were measured when succinate or acetate was used as carbon and energy source ( Table 3 ) .
The effects of succinate and acetate depended on a functional TcuR protein , as strain JE9315 [ ΔtcuR61 tcuA33 : : MudJ ( kan + ) ] containing a deletion of tcuR failed to activate tcuAlacZ on either succinate or acetate ( 3.0 ± 1.1 and 3.1 ± 1.8 U/OD 650 , respectively .
) This result was consistent with succinate and acetate acting as co - inducers of TcuR .
Because succinate is structurally similar to tricarballylate , ( Fig. 3 ) , we explained the stimulatory effect of succinate as molecular mimicry .
To explore this idea further , we combined succinate with acetate and found that such a combination did not stimulate tcuA - lacZ expression relative to when succinate or acetate was used alone ( Table 2 ) .
This result , while initially surprising , can possibly be explained if both succinate and acetate can not simultaneously occupy the co - inducer site due Res Microbiol .
Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2010 April 1 .
Page 5 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript to steric hindrance .
Perhaps succinate and acetate displaced each other from the co - inducer site , thus resulting in poor activation of TcuR .
To investigate the merit of this explanation we tested the combination of succinate and formate , which contains one less methyl group than acetate .
The latter combination stimulated tcuABC to higher levels than those measured when succinate was used alone ( Table 2 ) , lending support to the idea that the methyl group of acetate sterically hinders the combined binding of succinate and acetate to the co - inducer site of TcuR .
When used in combination with tricarballylate , neither succinate nor acetate abrogated the ability of tricarballylate to fully induce tcuA - lacZ expression ( data not shown ) , which most likely reflects a higher affinity of TcuR for tricarballylate in comparison to these molecular mimics .
In contrast to the above findings , citrate and isocitrate were poor co - inducers of TcuR , suggesting that the co - inducer binding site of TcuR does not allow the presence of polar functional groups on the carbons connected to the carbonyl carbons of the co - inducer .
One prediction for this hypothesis was that malate ( hydroxysuccinate , Fig. 3 ) would be a poor inducer relative to succinate .
Indeed , malate induced tcuA - lacZ expression only 17 - fold compared to 50 - fold for succinate ( Table 2 , lines 14 , 9 ) .
Furthermore , the malate/formate combination increased tcuABC expression only 15 - fold over un - induced levels .
In contrast , for the succinate/formate combination we measured a 93 - fold increased in expression , further supporting the idea that polar functional groups adjacent to the carbonyl groups may exert a negative effect on co - inducer binding .
Further in - vitro analysis of TcuR will address the true binding affinities of both succinate and acetate for TcuR as compared to tricarballylate .
tcuABC operon expression peaks during exponential phase Strain JE7212 was transformed with plasmid pTCU21 , which carried the entire tcuABC wildtype operon ; plasmid pTCU21 was previously shown to be able to complement the polar tcuA : : MudJ ( kan + ) mutation [ 24 ] .
Plasmid pTCU21 contains 16 nucleotides immediately upstream of the tcuA start codon ; the 16 - bp region contains the tcuA Shine - Dalgarno sequence but lacks the tcuA promoter and putative TcuR binding sites .
This construct allowed us to follow the temporal expression pattern of tcuABC expression while the cells are growing on tricarballylate .
Notably , this construct also allowed us to maintain the proper stoichiometry of TcuR and TcuR - binding sites on the chromosome .
To determine the temporal expression of the tcuABC operon , β - galactosidase assays were performed throughout the growth cycle when growing on tricarballylate ( Fig. 1A ) .
Expression of the tcuA - lacZ fusion peaked during exponential - growth and dropped back to lag - phase levels when the cells began to enter stationary - phase .
These results suggested that the level of TcuR protein was not constant throughout the cell cycle , that proteins other than TcuR were involved in tcuABC operon regulation , or that a combination of these two possibilities occurred .
We first tested whether TcuR regulated its own expression .
Because expression of the tcuA - lacZ fusion peaked at midlog phase , all experiments , including those shown in the preceding section above , were performed at mid - log phase to simplify comparisons .
TcuR does not regulate its own expression The first 600 bp immediately upstream of the tcuR start codon were cloned into a promoterless lacZ + fusion vector ( pRS551 ; ~ 20 -- 30 copies per cell ) to generate plasmid pTCU94 .
Expression of P tcuR - lacZ in strain TR6583 ( tcuR + ) remained constant in NB medium with or without 100 μM tricarballylate ( 1540 ± 20 versus 1450 ± 50 U/OD 650 , respectively ) .
In addition , expression of P tcuR - lacZ did not change when tcuR was inactivated ( JE7213 ; 1490 ± 40 U/OD 650 ) .
While most LTTRs repress their own transcription , those that do are most often divergently transcribed from the genes they regulate [ 29 ] .
Because tcuR is not divergently transcribed from tcuABC , the observation that neither TcuR nor tricarballylate had an effect on P tcuR - lacZtranscription was not surprising .
We further tested whether the differences in Res Microbiol .

Page 6 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript growth - rate expression of the tcuA - lacZ fusion were caused by differences in the level of TcuR throughout the growth phase .
Expression of of P tcuR - lacZ ( pTCU94 ) in the wild - type strain TR6583 was monitored at various time points when cells were growing on NCE - tricarballylate medium .
The level of P tcuR - lacZ expression did not change throughout the growth curve ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the increase in transcription of the chromosomal tcuA - lacZ fusion during exponential phase was not due to changes in the level of tcuR expression .
However , we can not at this time exclude the possibility that TcuR levels are regulated post - transcriptionally via targeted degradation or other means .
In addition , there is evidence that pBR322 derivatives ( i.e. pRS551 ) increase in copy number during stationary - phase [ 2 ] .
Thus , it is possible that a decrease in P tcuR - lacZ is masked by the increase in copy number .
Further in - vitro characterization of TcuR should establish whether TcuR can bind to its own promoter and repress transcription .
The cAMP - dependent global regulatory protein Crp negatively affects tcuABC expression We assessed whether the tcuABC operon was controlled by catabolite - repression .
For this purpose , we tested the effects of mutations in either adenylate cyclase ( Cya ) or cAMP receptor protein ( Crp ) .
Tricarballylate - dependent expression of the chromosomal tcuA - lacZ fusion in a strain of S. enterica carrying a null allele of the crp gene [ JE7830 tcuA33 : : MudJ ( lacZ + ) crp : : Tn10 ( tet + ) ] was > 10 - fold higher than the level of tcuA - lacZ expression in the crp + strain ( JE7212 tcuA33 : : MudJ ( lacZ + ) , Fig. 2 ) .
Consistent with the involvement of the Crp/cAMP complex , strain JE10114 [ tcuA33 : : MudJ ( lacZ + ) cya : : Tn10 ( tet + ) ] carrying a null allele of adenylate cyclase ( cya ) also showed a substantial increase ( 6 - fold ) in tcuA - lacZ expression relative to the level measured in the cya + strain .
Addition of cAMP ( 1 mM ) to the medium reduced tcuA - lacZ expression in the presence of tricarballylate > 3.5 - fold , and the introduction of plasmid pHY26 - 1 , which carried an allele of crp that encoded a cAMP - independent Crp protein , reduced tcuA - lacZ expression ~ 2 - fold .
Reasons that pHY26 - 1 resulted in lower repression compared to the addition of cAMP may include improper gene dosage and/or partial activity of the constitutive Crp variant protein .
If Crp were acting as a repressor of the tcuABC operon , we would expect tcuA - lacZ expression to be activated during - growth - on - glucose .
Indeed , tricarballylate - induced tcuA - lacZ expression was higher in glucose - containing medium than either citrate or glycerol - containing medium ( Table 2 ; lines 2 , 4 , 6 ) .
These results suggested that the Crp protein acted as a repressor of tcuABC expression .
This was somewhat surprising , as Crp most commonly acts as an activator and only a few enzyme - encoding genes are repressed by Crp/cAMP [ 17 ] .
It is not obvious why the cell would use Crp to repress tcuABC expression .
We speculate that the involvement of Crp in tcuABC expression reflects conditions where S. enterica encounters tricarballylate in the environment .
The extant regulatory circuit of tcuABC expression allows S. enterica to catabolize tricarballylate in the presence of glucose .
If glucose repressed tricarballylate catabolism in a canonical catabolite - repression fashion , any tricarballylate that entered the cell would inhibit aconitase , preventing the synthesis of essential amino - acid precursors such as α - ketoglutarate , succinyl - CoA and oxaloacetate .
It is possible that Crp acts as a repressor of tcuR and that Crp repression of tcuA - lacZ expression is at least partially the result of Crp - mediated repression of tcuR .
We tested whether P tcuR - lacZ expression from plasmid pTCU94 differed in either a crp or cya background ( strains JE10943 and JE10944 , respectively ) when the cells were grown in LB - medium containing tricarballylate ( 100 μM ) .
We measured no significant difference ( 1.2 fold ) in P tcuR - lacZ expression in the crp or cya strains compared to that of the wild - type strain TR6583 ( 1600 ± 70 and 1790 ± 40 versus 1450 ± 70 U/OD 650 , respectively ) .
Addition of cAMP ( 1 mM ) to the medium reduced P tcuR - lacZ in the cya strain by 1.3 - fold ( 1790 ± 40 versus 1360 ± 70 U / Res Microbiol .
Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2010 April 1 .
Page 7 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript OD 650 , respectively ) .
Furthermore , there was slight evidence of glucose activation , as expression of P tcuR - lacZ in the wild - type strain was only 1.1 - fold increased for cells growing on glucose compared to LB ( 1620 ± 50 vesus 1450 ± 70 U/OD 650 , respectively ) .
These results suggested that the Crp protein did not have an effect on tcuR expression .
While it is possible that Crp could have affected the copy number of pTCU94 , we found no evidence that this may be the case in the literature .
Additionally , there are no notable consensus motifs for Crp - binding sites in the tcuR promoter region ( see below ) .
Direct in - vitro binding studies between Crp and the tcuR promoter region would firmly establish whether Crp directly interacts with the tcuR promoter .
Crp - dependent repression of tcuA - lacZ expression and the increase in the expression of tcuAlacZ during mid - log growth suggest that tcuABC regulation is complex .
At present , it is unclear whether the effects of Crp are direct or indirect , and whether any other global regulators also control either tcuR or tcuABC operon expression .
Noteworthy , there are no notable consensus motifs for Crp - binding sites in either the tcuR or tcuA promoter regions .
If the Crp effect were indirect , we would hypothesize that Crp would act as an activator of a protein that represses tcuABC expression .
Hence in the absence of Crp , and consequently of the putative repressor , tcuABC expression would increase .
In vitro biochemical studies are needed to determine whether the effect of Crp on tcuABC expression is direct .
Isolation of two classes of constitutive TcuR variants Chemical mutagenesis with NG was performed on strain JE7212 ( tcuA33 : : MudJ ( lacZ + ) to isolate constitutive mutations in TcuR .
We selected derivatives of strain JE7212 that formed large colonies on NCE - lactose medium lacking tricarballylate .
Each mutant was reconstructed as described above , and in every case the Lac + phenotype was co - transducible with the kan + marker .
We identified eight mutant tcuR alleles upon sequencing ( Fig. 5 , supplemental material ) .
The promoter region of each tcuR strain was also sequenced , and no additional mutations were found .
Several tcuR mutations were isolated between residues 241 -- 244 , the region of the protein containing the putative C - terminal multimerization domain .
While the screen was likely non - saturating , several mutations were independently isolated twice ( E42G , L264R ) or thrice ( A242T ) , highlighting the relevance of the position .
Changes in the residues within the proposed co - inducer - binding domain were not isolated .
Reasons why we did not find mutations in this domain could include the mutational bias of NG , the stringency of the screen and the need for multiple mutations to observe the desired phenotype .
Expression of the tcuA - lacZ fusion in the mutant strains was assessed during - growth in rich medium with or without tricarballylate .
While every mutant strain had at least a 25 - fold increase in tcuA - lacZ expression in the absence of tricarballylate , there were two distinct phenotypes in the presence of tricarballylate .
Class I mutations mapped within four residues of each other , and were defined as those alleles encoding TcuR variants whose activity was > 2 - fold higher when tricarballylate was added to the medium ( Table 3 ) .
Class I mutations may bias TcuR towards achieving an active conformation in the absence of tricarballylate , but still allow a response to tricarballylate .
Class II mutations , with the lone exception of S241C , were located elsewhere in TcuR , and responded poorly to tricarballylate ( < 2 - fold induction of tcuABC ) .
Class II mutations may enhance DNA - binding independently of the normally required conformational change .
In fact , the E42G substitution ( a class II mutation ) falls within the putative helix - turn - helix , which would support this explanation .
The L264R substitution ( also class II ) may also increase DNA - binding affinity , as substitutions near this residue in both NahR ( regulator of naphthalene catabolism in Pseudomonas putida ) and AmpR ( regulator of β - lactamase expression in Citrobacter freundii ) led to loss of DNA - binding in previous studies [ 5,30 ] .

Page 8 NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript NIH - PA Author Manuscript Acknowledgments References Substitution G241C may be an outlier , as it falls within the group of residues with a Class I phenotype .
In this case , it is possible that this TcuR G241C variant is locked in a conformation that prevents it from responding to tricarballylate .
In vitro approaches are needed to analyze Class I and Class II mutations to determine their effects on DNA - binding and transcriptional activation .
This study establishes the in - vivo basis for the regulation of the tcuABC operon by TcuR and its co - inducer , tricarballylate .
We have shown that tricarballylate alone is sufficient for TcuRmediated induction of tcuABC .
Our results also demonstrate a role for the global regulator , Crp , in tricarballylate catabolism .
The results described here should be valuable for future structure/function analyses of the important LTTR family .
The response of TcuR to molecular mimics of tricarballylate including succinate and acetate may lead to increased understanding of how LTTRs recognize their co - inducers .
In addition , the two classes of constitutively active mutants may lead to understanding of how LTTRs adopt a transcriptionally competent conformation .
Current efforts are focused on obtaining a crystal structure of TcuR and performing detailed in - vitro analysis .
