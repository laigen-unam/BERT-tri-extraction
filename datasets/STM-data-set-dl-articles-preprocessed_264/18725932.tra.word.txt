We used HTPS to discover the Salmonella RNAs that are targeted by the common bacterial Sm - like protein , Hfq .
Initial transcriptomic analysis revealed that Hfq controls the expression of almost a fifth of all Salmonella genes , including several horizontally acquired pathogenicity islands ( SPI - 1 , -2 , - 4 , -5 ) , two sigma factor regulons , and the flagellar gene cascade .
Subsequent HTPS analysis of 350,000 cDNAs , derived from RNA co - immunoprecipitation ( coIP ) with epitope - tagged Hfq or control coIP , identified 727 mRNAs that are Hfq - bound in vivo .
The cDNA analysis discovered new , small noncoding RNAs ( sRNAs ) and more than doubled the number of sRNAs known to be expressed in Salmonella to 64 ; about half of these are associated with Hfq .
Our analysis explained aspects of the pleiotropic effects of Hfq loss - of - function .
Specifically , we found that the mRNAs of hilD ( master regulator of the SPI - 1 invasion genes ) and flhDC ( flagellar master regulator ) were bound by Hfq .
We predicted that defective SPI - 1 secretion and flagellar phenotypes of the hfq mutant would be rescued by overexpression of HilD and FlhDC , and we proved this to be correct .
The combination of epitope - tagging and HTPS of immunoprecipitated RNA detected the expression of many intergenic chromosomal regions of Salmonella .
Our approach overcomes the limited availability of high - density microarrays that have impeded expression - based sRNA discovery in microorganisms .
We present a generic strategy that is ideal for the systems - level analysis of the post - transcriptional regulons of RNA - binding proteins and for sRNA discovery in a wide range of bacteria .

* E - mail : jay.hinton@bbsrc.ac.uk ( JCDH ) ; vogel@mpiib - berlin.mpg.de ( JV ) Introduction Until now , global gene expression control studies have generally focussed on the transcriptional regulation exerted by the specific action of DNA binding proteins , and on the post - translational regulation governed by specific protein -- protein interactions .
In comparison , little is known about how RNA binding proteins facilitate the global control of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level .
However , the latest discoveries of many small noncoding RNAs ( sRNAs ) in both pro- and eukaryotes have shown that the interaction of RNA with proteins plays a prominent role in the regulation of cellular processes .
In bacteria , the majority of the sRNAs basepair with target mRNAs to regulate their translation and/or decay [ 1,2,3 ] , and these regulatory events commonly require the bacterial Sm - like protein , Hfq [ 4,5 ] .
Hfq is one of the most abundant RNA - binding proteins in bacteria [ 6,7,8 ] .
First identified in Escherichia coli as a host factor required for phage Qb RNA replication ,40 years ago [ 9 ] , Hfq is now known to have an important physiological role in numerous model bacteria [ 5 ] .
Almost half of all sequenced Gram - negative and Gram - positive species , and at least one archaeon , encode an Hfq homologue [ 10,11 ] .
Hfq interacts with regulatory sRNAs and mRNAs , and much of its post - transcriptional function is caused by the facilitation of the generally short and imperfect antisense interactions of sRNAs and their targets [ 12,13,14,15,16,17 ] .
However , Hfq can also act alone as a translational repressor of mRNA [ 18,19 ] , and can modulate mRNA decay by stimulating polyadenylation [ 20,21 ] .
In addition , roles of Hfq in tRNA biogenesis have recently been described [ 22,23 ] .
The pleiotropy of an hfq deletion mutation was first apparent from the multiple stress response - related phenotypes in E. coli [ 24 ] , and partly reflects the reduced efficiency of translation of rpoS mRNA , encoding the major stress sigma factor , sS [ 25,26 ] .
However , Hfq clearly impacts on bacterial physiology in a much broader fashion , including the sS - independent control of virulence - factors in pathogenic bacteria ( e.g. , [ 27,28,29,30 , 31,32,33 ] ) .
Specifically , deletion of hfq attenuates the ability of the model pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) to infect mice , to invade epithelial cells , to secrete virulence - factors and to survive inside cultured macrophages [ 32 ] .
PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 1 August 2008  Volume 4  Issue 8  e1000163 Hfq and Deep Sequencing Author Summary The past decade has seen small regulatory RNA become an important new mediator of bacterial mRNA regulation .
This study describes a rapid way to identify novel sRNAs that are expressed , and should prove relevant to a variety of bacteria .
We purified the epitope - tagged RNA - binding protein , Hfq , and its bound RNA by immunoprecipitation from the model pathogen , Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium .
This new strategy used Next Generation pyrosequencing to identify 727 Hfq - bound mRNAs .
The numbers of sRNAs expressed in Salmonella was doubled to 64 ; half are associated with Hfq .
We defined the exact coordinates of sRNAs , and confirmed that they are expressed at significant levels .
We also determined the Hfq regulon in Salmonella , and reported the role of Hfq in controlling transcription of major pathogenicity islands , horizontally acquired regions , and the flagellar cascade .
Hfq is reported to be a global regulator that affects the expression of almost a fifth of all Salmonella genes .
Our new approach will allow sRNAs and mRNAs to be characterized from different genetic backgrounds , or from bacteria grown under particular environmental conditions .
It will be valuable to scientists working on genetically tractable bacteria who are interested in the function of RNA - binding proteins and the identification of sRNAs .
Loss of Hfq function also results in a non - motile phenotype for Salmonella and the deregulation of .70 abundant proteins , including the accumulation of outer membrane proteins ( OMPs ) ; the latter is accompanied by a chronic activation of the sE ( s 24 ) - mediated envelope stress response [ 32,34 ] .
Hfq has also been implicated in the control of Salmonella gene expression changes induced by the low gravity condition experienced during spaceflight [ 35 ] .
Understanding how Hfq controls Salmonella gene expression at the post - transcriptional level requires the identification of its sRNA and mRNA ligands .
In a pioneering global study in E. coli , Zhang et al. ( 2003 ) used co - immunoprecipitation ( coIP ) with Hfq - specific antisera and direct detection of the bound RNAs on genomic highdensity oligonucleotide microarrays .
Although this method proved highly effective for detecting diverse sRNAs and mRNAs in E. coli , the requirement for high - density microarrays and specialized antibodies has hampered similar studies in other bacteria .
An alternate approach identified individual abundant Hfq - associated RNAs by cDNA cloning or direct sequencing [ 29,36 ] ; however , these methods are not appropriate for large - scale analyses .
To overcome these limitations for the global identification of Hfq targets in Salmonella , we have now used high - throughput pyrosequencing ( HTPS , a.k.a. deep sequencing ) of RNA associated with an epitope - tagged Hfq protein ( Figure 1 ) .
We show that this approach recovers Hfq - binding sRNAs with high specificity , and identifies their boundaries with unprecedented resolution .
We report the discovery of novel Salmonella sRNA genes , detect the expression of many conserved enterobacterial sRNA genes , and provide a set of potential mRNA targets in this model pathogen .
Comparison with the transcriptomic profile of an hfq mutant showed that Hfq mediates its pleiotropic effects by regulating the master transcription factors of complex regulons , and explained how Hfq is required for Salmonella virulence .
In microbiology , deep sequencing has been used extensively for genome sequencing , either of individual microbial species [ 37 ] or of bacterial communities [ 38 ] .
This study is the first report that describes the use of deep sequencing to study protein - bound mRNA from bacteria , and to discover bacterial noncoding RNAs .
Results Transcriptomic Profiling Reveals a Large Hfq Regulon in Salmonella To detect genes that are , directly or indirectly , regulated by Hfq the transcriptomic mRNA profile of the Salmonella wild - type and of mutant strain JVS - 0255 ( Dhfq ) was determined .
We used two different conditions for the comparison ; aerobic - growth in L - broth to early stationary - phase ( ESP ; OD 600 of 2 ) was chosen because the hfq mutation causes drastic protein pattern changes in ESP Salmonella [ 32 ] , and overnight growth in high - salt medium under oxygen limitation ( SPI - 1-inducing conditions ) to specifically activate the Salmonella virulence genes required for host cell invasion [ 39 ] .
Hfq - dependent mRNAs that showed statistically significant changes ( $ 2 - fold ) were identified , and we discovered that 734 genes were differentially expressed in the Dhfq strain grown to ESP ( 279 up - regulated genes , 455 down - regulated genes , Figure 2 and Table S1 ) .
Of the 71 proteins known to be Hfqdependent ( as determined by protein levels on 2D gels ; [ 32 ] ) , 50 % were regulated by Hfq at the transcriptional level ( Table S1 ) .
Consequently , Hfq controls the expression of 17 % of all Salmonella genes at ESP ( based on the 4425 annotated ORFs ; [ 40 ] ) .
Growth under SPI - 1 inducing conditions revealed 164 differentially expressed genes in Dhfq ( 91 up - , 73 down - regulated ; Table S2 ) .
69 % of these genes overlapped with the changes seen in ESP .
Taken together , Hfq affects at least 785 genes , or 18 % of the Salmonella genome .
Classification of the genes deregulated at ESP ( Table 1 ) showed that Hfq impacted upon 26 of the 107 functional groups annotated for Salmonella [ 41 ] ; in seven groups $ 50 % of all genes were misregulated .
In four of the five major Salmonella pathogenicity islands ( i.e. , SPI - 1 , -2 , -4 , -5 ) , and in the flagellar and chemotaxis pathways , .60 % of genes were down - regulated , which explains the previously observed invasion and motility phenotypes of Dhfq [ 32 ] .
Because Hfq affects the mRNAs of sS ( RpoS ) and sE ( RpoE ) [ 25,26,34,42 ] , two major alternative stress s factors of enterobacteria , we quantified the expression of these sigma factors in Salmonella at the mRNA level ( ESP ) and at the protein level ( ESP and SPI - 1 inducing conditions ) .
sE mRNA and protein levels were strongly elevated in Dhfq under both conditions tested ( Figure S1 ) , confirming the previously observed chronic induction of the envelope stress response .
Levels of rpoS mRNA were slightly increased , yet RpoS protein levels were strongly decreased .
This reflects the poor translation of rpoS mRNA in the absence of Hfq ( Figure S1 and [ 25,26 ] ) .
We used published lists of sE - and sS - dependent genes of Salmonella [ 43,44 ] to determine how the Hfq - dependent changes we observed were related to the sE and/or sS regulons .
We discovered that 55 % ( 41/75 ) and 73 % ( 54/74 ) of sE - and sSdependent genes were also Hfq - dependent .
Therefore , a proportion of the Hfq - dependent gene expression changes observed at ESP and under SPI - 1 inducing conditions were indirect effects caused by modulation of sS and sE levels by Hfq .
The S. Typhimurium genome contains about 444 genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ; [ 45 ] ) .
122 or 17 of these HGT genes were Hfq - dependent under ESP or SPI - 1 inducing conditions , respectively ( 16 genes being Hfq - dependent under both conditions ; Tables S1 , S2 ) .
In other words , Hfq regulates - 28 % of the HGT genes , significantly more than the 18 % regulated when using the entire Salmonella genome for calculation .
This may indicate a role of Hfq in the acquisition of DNA from foreign sources , by regulating expression of newly acquired genes at the RNA level .

Strategy to identify Hfq targets .
RNA was co - immunoprecipitated with Hfq in extracts from ESP - grown Salmonella cells ( wild - type and chromosomal hfq FLAG strain ) using an anti - FLAG antibody .
The extracted RNA was converted to 59 monophosphate RNA , and subsequently into cDNA , followed by direct pyrosequencing .
Our approach was validated by hybridization of cDNA to high density oligo microarrays .
In addition , total RNA of the wild - type strain and its hfq deletion mutant was used for transcriptomic analysis using Salmonella SALSA microarrays .
g001 Deep Sequencing of Hfq - Associated RNAs The variety of transcriptional regulons that showed Hfqdependent expression patterns could either be mediated by the binding of certain regulatory sRNAs or of specific mRNAs by Hfq .
To identify the direct Hfq targets we co - immunoprecipitated RNA with the chromosomally FLAG epitope - tagged Hfq protein expressed by a Salmonella hfq FLAG strain [ 46 ] .
CoIP was performed in extracts prepared from ESP - grown bacteria .
The Hfqassociated RNA was converted to cDNA , and a total of 176,907 cDNAs pooled from two independent biological experiments was then characterised by high - throughput pyrosequencing [ 37 ] .
The resulting sequences , from here on referred to as `` Hfq cDNAs '' , ranged in length from 1 to 145 bp , and 92 % were $ 18 bp ( Figure 3A ) .
Disregarding small cDNAs ( ,18 bp ) , 122,326 sequences were unequivocally mapped to the Salmonella genome by WU - BLAST searches ( http://blast.wustl.edu/ ; Figure 2 ) .
About half of the mapped cDNAs ( 57,529 ) were derived from rRNA , tRNA , and housekeeping RNAs ( tmRNA , M1 RNA , and SRP RNA ; Figure 3B ) .
Of the remaining 64,797 sequences , the majority corresponded to mRNA regions ( 53 % matched the sense strand of protein - coding regions ) , followed by known/predicted conserved sRNAs ( 18 % ; [ 47 ] ; for distribution see Figure 3C ) , predicted Salmonella - specific sRNAs ( 1 % ; [ 46 ] ) and sequences that were antisense to ORF regions ( 3 % ) .
The remaining 25 % of cDNAs mostly represented intergenic regions ( IGRs ) and 59/39 UTRs , with a few antisense transcripts to tRNAs , rRNAs , and sRNAs ( 0.1 % ; Figure 3B ) .
To confirm that our procedure did effectively enrich Hfqassociated RNAs , we analyzed 175,142 cDNAs from a control coIP using wild - type Salmonella ( expressing untagged Hfq ) .
Of these `` Control cDNAs '' which ranged in length from 1 to 290 bp ( Figure 3A ) , 145,873 sequences were $ 18 bp in size and could be correlated to the Salmonella chromosome .
Most of the inserts ( 91 % ) were abundant rRNA , tRNA , and housekeeping RNA transcripts ( Fig 3B ) .
The remaining 13,725 sequences were used to calculate the level of enrichment of Hfq - bound RNA ( see below ) .
Visualizing Hfq - Dependent RNAs at the Nucleotide Level Upon WU - BLAST matching , the number of cDNA hits for each nucleotide position for either strand of the Salmonella chromosome was calculated , and visualized using the Integrated Genome Browser ( IGB , Affymetrix ) .
This browser allows the visualization of both whole genomes and individual genomic regions .
Figure 4 shows the distribution of cDNA sequences over a subsection of the genome , i.e. the ,40 kb SPI - 1 virulence region , for which we observed strong enrichment of Hfq cDNAs over the Control cDNAs .
As well as the 35 mRNAs of protein - coding genes , SPI - 1 encodes the Hfq - dependent InvR sRNA [ 46 ] .
Enrichment of InvR by coIP with FLAG - tagged Hfq was previously demonstrated by Northern blot analysis [ 46 ] , and this PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 3 August 2008  Volume 4  Issue 8  e1000163 Hfq and Deep Sequencing Figure 2 .

Hfq - Dependent sRNAs Are Highly Associated with Hfq Inspection of the cDNA libraries revealed that a major class were derived from sRNA regions .
These sRNAs , as well as their enrichment by Hfq coIP , are listed in Tables 2 and S3 .
The three most abundant sRNAs , according to the numbers of Hfq cDNA sequences are InvR , SraH ( a.k.a. RyhA ) and SroB ( RybC ) , and are known to be strongly bound by Hfq [ 17,46 ] ; coIP of Hfq enriched these three sRNAs by 30 - to 57 - fold , in comparison to the control reaction .
For example , InvR , which binds Hfq with a k D of 10 nM [ 46 ] , was represented by 3,236 Hfq cDNAs and 113 Control cDNAs ( Table 2 ) .
In contrast , other sRNAs not expected to be Hfq - dependent were found in equal numbers in the two samples .
For example , the CsrB or CsrC sRNAs which target the conserved RNA - binding protein , CsrA [ 48 ] , were represented by almost equal numbers in the Hfq and Control cDNAs ( CsrB , 67/69 ; CsrC , 63/64 ; Table 2 ) .
Moreover , cDNAs of the abundant yet Hfq - independent 6S RNA [ 49 ] were found in smaller numbers in the Hfq than in the control library ( 451 versus 836 ; Table 2 ) .
Figure 5 illustrates the distribution of cDNAs of the three predominant Hfq - bound RNAs and of the Hfq - independent 6S RNA .
cDNAs of both the InvR ( 89 nt ; [ 46 ] ) and SroB ( 84 nt ; [ 50 ] ) sRNAs mapped along the entire RNA coding sequence from the transcriptional start site to the Rho - independent terminator .
SraH , which is transcribed as an unstable 120 nt precursor and processed into an abundant ,58 nt RNA species ( 39 part of SraH ; [ 17,51 ] ) , was almost exclusively recovered as the processed sRNA .
Notably , the borders of the cDNA clusters were in perfect agreement with previous 59 and/or 39 end mapping data of the four sRNAs [ 46,50,51,52 ] .
In other words , our cDNA sequencing approach not only detects association with Hfq , but also identifies the termini of expressed sRNAs at nucleotide - level resolution .

t001 Identification of Expressed Salmonella sRNAs To evaluate the sRNA expression profile of Salmonella more extensively , we analyzed three classes of sRNA candidate loci for coverage by the Hfq and Control cDNAs .
First , cDNAs of E. coli sRNA candidate loci with predicted conservation in Salmonella were inspected [ 17,47,49,50,51,53,54 ] .
Second , we counted cDNAs of Salmonella - specific sRNAs predicted in two recent global screens [ 46,55 ] .
Third , we manually inspected cDNAs from a third of the Salmonella chromosome ( first 1.6 Mb ) and all major five pathogenicity islands for expression patterns of IGRs indicative of new sRNA genes , and for possible enrichment by Hfq coIP .
Using criteria similar to [ 49 ] , our evaluation of these loci considered orphan promoter/terminator signals , and possible conservation in bacteria other than E. coli .
Of the latter two classes of candidates ( summarized in Table S3 ) , those with an Hfq enrichment factor $ 10 and/or candidates showing strong promoter/terminator predictions were selected for Northern blot analysis .
To assess sRNA expression under relevant environmental conditions , we probed RNA from five stages of growth in standard L - broth from exponential to stationary - phases , and from two conditions known to strongly induce the expression of the major SPI - 1 [ 39,56 ] or SPI - 2 [ 57 ] virulence regions .
The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 2 ( the whole set of candidates tested is shown in Table S3 ) ; including the 26 previously detected Salmonella sRNAs [ 34,46,55,58,59,60,61,62,63 ] , a total of 64 Salmonella sRNAs can now be considered to be experimentally validated .
We used Northern blots to detect 10 of the 31 newly identified Salmonella sRNAs under the environmental conditions that were tested ( Figure 6 , Tables 2 and S3 ) .
These sRNAs yielded stable transcripts , predominantly in the 50 to 100 nt range ( Figure 6A and B ) .
Faint bands of larger transcripts were observed for STnc150 ( 150 nt ) , and STnc400 ( 190 nt ) , resembling certain E. coli sRNAs such as SraH whose precursor is rapidly degraded whilst the processed form accumulates [ 51 ] .
The STnc150 , 400 , and 560 sRNAs are almost constitutively expressed , whereas STnc500 , 520 and 540 are only expressed in certain environmental conditions .
Intriguingly , STnc580 can only be detected under SPI - 1 inducing conditions that mimic the environment Salmonella encounters in the host intestine .
Generally , only candidates represented by $ 20 cDNAs in a cDNA pool yielded a signal on Northern blots ( Tables 2 and S3 ) .
While this suggests some correlation between intracellular abundance and cDNA frequency , we note the case of STnc150 , for which a single cDNA was recovered yet a strong signal was obtained on Northern blots .
In contrast , several PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 5 August 2008  Volume 4  Issue 8  e1000163 Hfq and Deep Sequencing ranging in size from 500 to 2000 nucleotides ( STnc180 , Stnc190 , STnc330 , STnc470 , STnc610 , and STnc640 ; Figure S2 and Table S3 ) , and are likely to be processed mRNA species .
Three sRNAs expressing stable transcripts of ,85 to 90 nts originate from close to , or within , IS200 transposable elements ( Figure 6B ) .
STnc290 and STnc440 are expressed just upstream of and , respectively , whereas STnc490 is antisense to the translational start site of the IS200 transposase ORF .
IS200 elements generally posses two stem - loop structures , one of which is a Rho - independent transcription terminator that prevents readthrough from genes located upstream of the integration site [ 64 ] .
Given their location , the STnc290 sRNA could originate from processing of the STM3033 transcripts reading into the terminator structure ; by analogy , STnc440 would be derived from STM4310 transcripts .
If so , this would constitute interesting cases in which transposon insertion has created stable sRNAs .
The other IS200 stem - loop functions as a translational repressor by sequestering the start codon of the transposon ORF [ 64 ] ; STnc490 overlaps with this structure on the opposite strand , and by acting as an antisense RNA may function as an additional repressor of IS200 .
We determined whether 8 of the new Salmonella sRNAs showed an Hfq - dependent pattern of transcript abundance that correlated with Hfq binding ( Figure 6C ) .
The STnc290 , 440 , 490 , 520 , 540 and 560 sRNAs were all enriched by Hfq coIP ( Table 2 ) , by factors up to 51 - fold ( STnc440 ) .
The expression of the four sRNAs with the highest enrichment factors ( STnc290 , 440 , 520 , 560 ) was strongly reduced in Dhfq , and so classified as Hfq - dependent ; in contrast , the accumulation of STnc150 , STnc490 and STnc540 ( $ 1.0 - , 5.1 - , and 3.3 - fold enrichment , respectively ) was unaffected in the absence of Hfq .
STnc500 , which is only detected in samples originating from cultures at OD 600 of 1 , and STnc580 , which seems to be specifically expressed under the SPI - 1 inducing condition , were not detected on these blots .
In addition to the sRNAs listed above , the cDNAs included two loci predicted to encode small peptides , i.e. shorter than the 34 amino - acid cut - off used to define ORFs in the current Salmonella genome annotation [ 40 ] .
These are referred to as STnc250 and STnc570 in Table 2 , and correspond to the predicted small ypfM and yneM mRNA - encoding genes of E. coli [ 49 ] .
Probing of the Salmonella loci yielded signals of stable short mRNAs which are expressed in a growth phase - dependent manner ( Figure S3 ) .

The names of the six most frequently recovered sRNAs are given .
g003 candidates with .20 cDNAs failed the Northern blot validation ( Table S3 ) .
We speculated that the corresponding cDNAs were derived from 59 or 39 UTRs of larger mRNA transcripts , and tested this on Northern blots of agarose gels .
We tested 14 of such candidates which had the appropriate orientation to flanking mRNA genes to be UTR - derived ; six of these showed signals Hfq - Associated mRNAs To determine which of the 34,136 cDNAs were derived from Hfq - bound mRNAs and represented genuine mRNA targets , a stringent cutoff was used .
An mRNA coding region ( CDS ) was required to be represented by $ 10 cDNAs to be considered significant , which identified 727 Hfq - bound mRNAs ( cistrons ) for further analysis .
Table 3 lists the top 42 mRNAs with at least 100 cDNAs in the Hfq coIP library ( Table S4 lists all 727 mRNAs ) .
In the genome browser , many of these enriched mRNAs were readily visible as a distinct cDNA cluster , e.g. , the ompD mRNA ( encoding the major Salmonella outer membrane protein ) shown in Figure 7A .
A survey of the transcriptomic data revealed that 33 % of the Hfqbound mRNAs showed an Hfq - dependent pattern of gene expression ( Table S1 ) .
The reciprocal analysis showed that 32 % of the Hfq - dependent mRNAs were bound to Hfq ( Table S1 ) .
We attribute the observed partial overlap of the Hfq coIP and the transcriptomic data ( 33 % ) to three major factors .
First , Hfq regulates transcription factors , de - regulation of which alters the expression of downstream genes .
In other words , not every gene deregulated in the Dhfq strain is necessarily a `` direct '' Hfq target , i.e. its mRNA bound by Hfq .
Second , there may be a considerable PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 6 August 2008  Volume 4  Issue 8  e1000163 Hfq and Deep Sequencing Figure 4 .

Shown are the annotations for the `` + '' and `` -- '' strand ( blue ) , the cDNA sequence distribution from the Hfq coIP for the `` + '' and `` -- '' strand ( red ) , the cDNA - clone distribution for the control coIP for the `` + '' and `` -- '' strand ( black ) , and the genome coordinates in the center for the entire SPI - 1 .
The annotation for SPI - 1 and the Hfq coIP peaks for hilD and the sRNA InvR in the Hfq coIP are indicated .
Note , that the clone numbers per nucleotide are scaled to a maximum of 250 for the Hfq and the control coIP , which truncates the high peak for InvR in the Hfq coIP library ( .3000 cDNAs ) .
The lower panel shows a close up of the invR locus and its adjacent genes .
g004 number of Hfq - associated mRNAs below our very stringent cut - off for Hfq - association ; increasing sequencing depth will overcome this problem .
Third , the precise borders of most 59/39 UTRs are unknown in Salmonella ( and any other bacterial genome sequence ) ; consequently , calculations of Hfq enrichment were limited to the CDS of an mRNA .
As outlined further below ( Figure 7B ) , this can skew the overall enrichment factor .
To validate our cDNA sequencing approach for the detection of Hfq - bound mRNAs by the conventional approach , we hybridized the RNA obtained from Hfq and control coIP to a S. Typhimurium oligonucleotide microarray .
Analysis of this coIPon - Chip experiment with SAM - software ( Statistical Analysis of Microarrays ; FDR ,0.01 ) identified 365 enriched mRNAs .
Nearly half ( 45 % ) of these mRNAs corresponded to regions identified by the deep sequencing approach ( Table S5 ; P,10e - 10 ) .
The overlap increased to 67 % when genes that showed enrichment values above 5 were taken into consideration .
Although coIP - on - Chip displays a lower sensitivity than deep sequencing these two independent methods do generate comparable results for the identification of mRNA - protein interactions .
Genome annotations of protein - coding genes are generally limited to the mRNA coding regions ( CDS ) .
Whilst Tables 3 and S4 list absolute hit numbers in annotated CDS , the detailed analysis of cDNA distribution over a given mRNA gene often revealed a more complex picture .
For example , the number of ompA cDNAs does not drastically differ in the two libraries ( Hfq coIP , 102 ; control coIP , 77 ) , which would question whether ompA is an Hfq - bound mRNA .
However , up to 12 - fold enrichment is seen in some sections of the ompA mRNA , e.g. , around the AUG and in the central CDS ( Figure 7B ) .
Note that the availability of cDNA hit numbers for every single nucleotide of the Salmonella chromosome offers the possibility to also analyze 59 and 39 UTRs of mRNAs , which are not included in Tables 3 and S4 , but could also be targeted by Hfq .
Figure 8A further illustrates the complex enrichment patterns of diverse mRNAs , some of which may be explained by previous data obtained for these transcripts , as discussed below .

t002 of the Salmonella flagellar genes ) were distributed over the entire length of the relevant gene , including the ,300 nt 39 UTR in the case of hilD .
Either Hfq does target such a large number of sites on these three mRNAs , or alternatively , given that Hfq is a ribosomebound protein , these cDNAs may derive from polysome - bound mRNAs .
ii ) cDNAs of ompD were also distributed over the entire ompD locus , and abruptly ended 50 nt downstream of the ompD stop codon , at the predicted Rho - independent terminator ; a major cDNA cluster was observed around the ompD AUG start codon , i.e. the 270 to +19 region ( for separate display of control coIP , Hfq coIP , and enrichment curves see Figure 7A ) .
Intriguingly , this particular region binds Hfq with high affinity in - vitro ( k D # 1 nM ; [ 32 ] ) .
Binding of Hfq to the ompD AUG region may control translation initiation analogous to the Hfq - mediated repression of the E. coli ompA mRNA [ 18 ] .
Similarly , cDNAs representing dppA clustered at the 59 end of this mRNA , from the transcriptional +1 site into the N - terminal ( signal peptide ) coding region .
The Hfqdependent sRNA , GcvB , is known to target the dppA 59 UTR [ 58 ] , and our data suggest that Hfq - binding to this dppA region could enhance GcvB action .
iii ) cDNA clones of the ,10 kb flgBCDEF - GHIJKL mRNA ( flagellar components ) were almost exclusively derived from the terminal , 80 nt region downstream of the flgL stop codon which includes the terminator .
It is possible that Hfq controls flagellar operon mRNA expression through modulation of mRNA decay initiating at the 39 end .
iv ) Almost all of the 48 cDNAs of the dicistronic glmUS mRNA mapped in two clusters to the glmUS IGR ( 188 nt ) .
cDNAs of the upstream cluster start with the adenosine of the glmU UGA stop codon and span the first 73 nt of the IGR .
In E. coli , glmUS mRNA undergoes RNaseEdependent cleavage within the glmU UGA to generate a monocistronic glmS mRNA [ 65,66 ] ; the glmS mRNA is activated by the GlmZ sRNA , which binds Hfq [ 49 ] and the glmUS IGR [ 19 ] .
As mentioned for GcvB/dppA , Hfq is likely to aid the binding of GlmZ to the glmUS mRNA in the region of the two clusters of cDNAs .
It is worth noting that the extended steps of lysate preparation and antibody incubation involved in the Hfq coIP protocol do cause some mRNA degradation [ 17 ] .
Our Northern blots did not detect full - length mRNA in the RNA samples from the Salmonella Hfq coIP ( data not shown ) .
We believe that the sequenced cDNAs were synthesized from a mixture of shorter cDNA fragments , rather than from intact transcripts of several kb in length .
The short cDNAs that were prepared from Hfq coIP have the advantage of favoring the primary Hfq binding region .
To confirm that Hfq bound to enriched mRNA regions , corresponding fragments of the dppA , glmUS , flhD and hilD mRNAs were in - vitro - synthesized , and analyzed in gel mobility - shift assays ( Figure 8B ) .
These RNA fragments were fully shifted by addition of # 50 nM Hfq hexamer , which suggested significantly stronger binding than to the previously tested , non - specific metK mRNA ( k D $ 250 nM ; [ 32 ] ) which is not regulated by Hfq and was not recovered by Hfq coIP ( Tables S1 and S4 ) .
Thus , the cDNA sequences appear to represent high - affinity , primary binding sites of Hfq on mRNAs .
Mechanisms of Pleiotropic Hfq Effects in Virulence and Flagellar Pathways Our analyses revealed an intriguing relationship between the transcriptomic and deep sequencing data ; the genes belonging to some regulons were consistently down - regulated in the Dhfq mutant , yet Hfq only associated with a few of the relevant mRNAs .
For example , the transcriptomic data showed that the entire SPI - 1 pathogenicity island was down - regulated in the Dhfq mutant , but the Hfq coIP only showed a strong enrichment for a small subset PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 10 August 2008  Volume 4  Issue 8  e1000163 Hfq and Deep Sequencing Figure 5 .

g005 of SPI - 1 genes ( hilC , hilD , invFGAC , sicA , sip operon , prgHK , and orgB ; Tables S1 , S4 and Figures 4 , S4 ) .
Of these , hilD encodes the primary transcriptional activator of the SPI - 1 region [ 67 ] .
We hypothesized that loss of Hfq - association with hilD mRNA in Dhfq causes loss of HilD protein synthesis , and thereby one of the strongest hfq phenotypes , i.e. loss of SPI - 1 activation and virulence factor ( effector protein ) secretion .
If so , ectopic HilD overexpression should restore SPI - 1 effector secretion to Dhfq .
As predicted , overproduction of HilD from a P BAD expression plasmid restored SPI - 1 effector secretion to almost wild - type levels in the absence of Hfq ( Figure 9A ; compare lanes 1 and 4 ) , and also rescued expression of the PrgI needle protein indicative of a functional SPI - 1 secretion apparatus ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , ectopic production of HilA , the SPI - 1 transcription factor that acts downstream of HilD , failed to influence the secretion defect of Dhfq .
Preliminary data from gentamicin protection assays that assess epithelial cell invasion of Salmonella , suggests that overexpression of HilD increased the invasion rate of the Dhfq strain by a factor of ten ( data not shown ) .
Thus , by identifying the hilD mRNA as a direct Hfq target , we have revealed the mechanism of part of the pleiotropic virulence defect of the Dhfq strain .
In an analogous situation , 87 % of the flagellar genes were down - regulated in the Dhfq mutant , yet Hfq primarily bound to the fhlDC ( class I genes ) , flgMN , flgKL , fliAZ , fliD , fliI and fliP mRNAs ( class II genes ) and fliC mRNA ( class III gene ; Tables S1 , S4 and Figure S4 ) .
fhlDC encodes the key transcription factor of the flagellar gene cascade , and we predicted that loss of this mRNA would account for much of the flagellar defect of Dhfq , which is associated with strongly reduced levels of the major flagellin , FliC ( Figure 9B ) .
Ectopic expression of flhDC restored the levels of FliC to almost wild - type levels in the Dhfq strain carrying the pBAD - flhDC plasmid ( Figure 9B ) .
We note , however , that the previously reported non - motile phenotype of Dhfq on swim agar plates [ 32 ] was not rescued by flhDC overexpression ( data not shown ) , presumably because the FlhD 2 C 2 - independent chemotaxis genes required for full motility are also down - regulated in the absence of Hfq ( Table 1 ) .
Discussion To understand how bacterial RNA binding proteins such as Hfq mediate the control of global gene expression at the posttranscriptional level , direct targets need to be identified .
The first approach that was used to do this in a global fashion involved detection of RNA co - immunoprecipitated with Hfq - specific antibodies on high - density oligonucleotide microarrays , and identified new E. coli sRNAs and interesting properties of Hfq [ 17 ] .
Similarly , microarray - based detection following co - immunoprecipitation of eukaryotic mRNA -- protein complexes ( mRNPs ) identified endogenous organization patterns of mRNAs and cellular proteins [ 68 ] .
Epitope - tagging of the yeast La homolog was successfully used for global coIP analysis [ 69 ] .
However , the requirement for custom high - density microarrays and/or speciesspecific antibodies has impeded similar studies in other organisms .
It is now apparent that the ideal sRNA discovery approach would not only detect sRNAs , but would also define their exact sequence .
Given the typical genome size of model bacteria ( ,5 Mb ) , a highdensity oligonucleotide microarray with ,10 million oligonucleotide probes would be required to achieve single basepair resolution .
Such arrays do not exist for any organism , and even today 's high - density arrays ( with 0.5 million features ) come with extraordinarily high set - up and printing costs , and are available for very few bacteria .
Our strategy remedies these technical and financial limitations .
The identification of Hfq - associated RNAs in Salmonella is based upon a powerful chromosomal epitope - tagging approach [ 70 ] , followed by coIP with a commercially - available antibody , and sequencing of hundreds of thousands cDNAs .
The earlier shotguncloning studies in bacteria [ 50,54,71 ] and many other organisms ( reviewed in [ 72,73 ] ) were limited by costly Sanger - type sequencing of individual cDNA inserts from plasmid vectors .
The deep sequencing approach described here avoids a cloning step , and is able to detect small RNAs with unparalleled sensitivity by defining the 59 and 39 ends of transcripts at basepair resolution .
Deep sequencing of cDNAs has identified the small RNA component of eukaryotic transcriptomes ( e.g. , [ 74,75 ] ) , and new classes of noncoding RNAs associated with eukaryotic RNAbinding proteins [ 76,77 ] .
These studies primarily focussed on the class of 20 -- 30 nucleotide long microRNAs and siRNAs , and typically included size - fractionation steps .
Bacterial riboregulators are considerably larger ( 80 - 250 nucleotides ) , and we show that even without prior size fractionation , deep sequencing can capture and define the termini of these large sRNAs .
Our analysis extends the tally of confidently identified sRNAs to 64 in the model pathogen , S. Typhimurium ( Table 2 ) .
Thirty eight of these are conserved sRNAs that were initially identified in E. coli , but only a few of their homologues have previously been shown to be expressed in other enteric bacteria [ 58,59,60,61,62,63,78,79 ] .
A recent study of the widely conserved DsrA and RprA sRNAs [ 80 ] failed to validate their expression and/or function in Salmonella [ 81 ] .
Our observation of 149 ( DsrA ) and 286 ( RprA ) cDNAs in the Hfq coIP libraries ( versus 6/37 in the control library ) , unequivocally confirmed that these important stress response regulators are both expressed and Hfq - associated .
The finding , from this and other studies , that highly - conserved sRNAs are commonly expressed at the transcriptional level should prove useful to researchers working in other bacterial systems .
A significant number of the Hfq - associated cDNAs correspond to sRNA loci that are absent from E. coli ( [ 46,55 ] and Table 2 ) .

The enrichment factor of each of these sRNAs in the coIP experiment is given below the blots for comparison .
g006 these , invR exemplifies a sRNA gene that was likely horizontally acquired with the SPI - 1 virulence region , early in Salmonella evolution [ 46 ] .
Intriguingly , InvR is the most frequently recovered sRNA ( .3,000 cDNAs in the Hfq coIP library ) , which shows that our approach is not only effective for detecting conserved , but also species - specific sRNAs of recently acquired pathogenicity regions .
Horizontal transfer of virulence islands is a driving force in the evolution of bacterial pathogens [ 82 ] , and knowledge of the Figure 7 .

Shown are ( from top to bottom ) the annotations for the `` + '' strand ( blue ) , the enrichment curve ( grey ) , the cDNA distributions on the `` + '' strand for the Hfq coIP ( red ) and the control coIP ( black ) , the genome coordinates , and the annotations for the `` -- '' strand ( blue ) .
In panel A , the annotation of the ompD coding region and the flanking genes , yddG and STM1573 , are indicated .
For ompA , the CDS , -10 and -35 boxes , as well as the ribosome binding site ( RBS ) and a CRP binding site are indicated by black arrows .
g007 functional elements of these islands is key to understanding pathogenesis .
Whereas ORF identification in such islands has become routine , island - specific sRNAs are more difficult to recognize by bioinformatic - based approaches .
Besides confirming InvR , the present study found evidence for the expression of five of the 47 Salmonella sRNA candidate loci listed by Pfeiffer et al. [ 46 ] , who predicted orphan promoter / terminator pairs in IGRs ( Table S3 and Figure 2 ) .
One of these , i.e. STnc250 , has turned out as a small mRNA gene ( see above ) .
While this study was in progress , others reported the discovery of 18 Salmonella expressed sRNA loci [ 55 ] .
We recovered cDNAs of 8 of these sRNAs ( isrB - 1 , C , E , I - L , and P ; Table 2 ) .
The fact that 10 of these sRNAs were not recovered probably reflects their lowlevel expression under the growth - condition used here [ 55 ] .
This observation suggests an improvement that could be made to our method .
RNomics - or microarray - based sRNA discovery methods require sRNAs to be expressed under the chosen assay condition , unlike bioinformatics - aided approaches that score for orphan transcription signals and primary sequence conservation [ 49,51,83,84 ] or for conservation of RNA structure [ 53 ] .
Thus , future studies combining several different growth - conditions with increasing sequencing depth are likely to identify even more novel sRNAs .
Regarding the sensitivity of our approach , it is remarkable that RyeB sRNA was found in 653 Hfq cDNAs and 24 Control cDNAs ( Table 2 ) ; RyeB is late stationary - phase - specific [ 49,50 ] , and barely detectable by probing of Salmonella RNA from the coIP assay condition by Northern blot ( unpublished results ) .
Moreover , the 24 cDNAs recovered from the control library , i.e. without Hfq coIP , suggest the exciting possibility that deep sequencing of total RNA , without prior enrichment or size - fractionation , will prove to be a successful approach for sRNA discovery .
Like any other global method for RNA identification [ 85,86 ] , our approach is likely to show certain biases , e.g. , caused by cross - hybridization in the immunoprecipitation step , or from the limited ability of reverse transcriptase to deal with stable RNA structures in cDNA synthesis , and these will need to be studied in more detail .
However , it is clear that deep sequencing resolved the termini of many expressed and/or Hfq - bound sRNAs at basepair resolution ( Figure 5 ) , which has not been achieved by other methods .
The combination of HTPS of co - immunoprecipitated sRNAs and mRNAs with transcriptomics partly explains how Hfq acts as a pleiotropic regulator of Salmonella gene expression .
Transcriptome analysis under two different growth - conditions suggests that Hfq regulates the expression of nearly a fifth of all Salmonella genes .
This proportion of Hfq - dependent genes is similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( ,15 % of all genes ; [ 87 ] ) , but bigger than for E. coli ( 6.3 % ; [ 42 ] ) , or Vibrio cholerae ( 5.6 % ; [ 30 ] ) .
However , the different growth - conditions and scoring parameters used for these other organisms preclude a direct comparison with our Salmonella data .
Nonetheless , the strong impact of Hfq on the sS and sE stress regulons that we observed is consistent with the findings in E. coli [ 42 ] and in part in V. cholerae ( sE ; [ 30 ] ) , and expands the previous work on Salmonella sS and sE regulated genes PLoS Genetics  www.plosgenetics.org 13 August 2008  Volume 4  Issue 8  e1000163 Hfq and Deep Sequencing Figure 8 .

Following 10 minutes incubation at 37uC , samples were resolved on native 6 % polyacrylamide gels , autoradiographs of which are shown .
g008 [ 34,43,44,88,89,90,91 ] to a global level .
Importantly , our combined transcriptomic and coIP data revealed that Hfq exerts a direct role in gene expression through the control of specific check - points in other well - defined transcriptional regulons , such as HilD in the SPI - 1 virulence regulon , and FlhD 2 C 2 in the flagellar gene expression cascade .
Transcriptomic profiling by itself is clearly unable to differentiate between transcriptional and post - transcriptional effects of Hfq .
In contrast , enrichment of a regulated mRNA in the Hfq library has successfully hinted at post - transcriptional regulation by sRNAs .
For example , the observation of OmpX overproduction in Salmonella Dhfq , combined with ompX mRNA enrichment by Hfq coIP in E. coli [ 17 ] , led to the prediction that OmpX synthesis is repressed by an Hfq - dependent antisense sRNA ; this sRNA was subsequently identified as CyaR in Salmonella [ 63 ] .
Tables 2 and 3 confirm that both ompX mRNA and CyaR strongly associate with Salmonella Hfq ( 22.8 - fold and 21.2 - fold enrichment , respectively ) .
Our current data set comprises several hundred such candidate mRNAs ( Table S4 ) ; this catalogue contains many experimentally confirmed targets of Salmonella sRNAs , e.g. , the dppA , fadL , ompD , or oppA mRNAs [ 34,46,58,59 ] .
Integrating the score for Hfqassociation deduced from our experiments , and -- where applicable -- from the available E. coli data [ 17 ] into available algorithms such as TargetRNA [ 92 ] could significantly improve target predictions for the large class of Hfq - dependent sRNAs .
Such predictions bring new understanding to the pleiotropic phenotypes caused by the absence of Hfq in Salmonella [ 32 ] .

FliC was also analyzed on a Western blot using a specific antibody ( lower panel ) .
FliC protein levels are shown ( in % ) , in comparison to wild - type Salmonella , which was set to 100 % for either the total protein or secreted protein lanes .
g009 now be explained by the requirement of Hfq for the expression of all but one key pathogenicity islands of Salmonella ( SPI - 3 ) .
In the SPI - 1 invasion gene island , HilD acts at the top of a transcription factor cascade to activate SPI - 1 genes , and to mediate secretion of effector proteins by the SPI - 1 type III secretion system ( reviewed in [ 67,93 ] ) .
The levels of hilD mRNA were sevenfold reduced in Dhfq , but the unchanged activity of a hilD promoter fusion in this background ( unpublished data ) argues against direct transcriptional control by Hfq .
Rather , the 7.5 - fold enrichment of hilD cDNAs by Hfq coIP ( Table S4 ) suggests that hilD is posttranscriptionally activated in a Hfq - dependent process , presumably involving an unknown sRNA .
Our demonstration that SPI - 1 virulence factor secretion is fully restored by HilD overproduction in Dhfq raises the exciting possibility that post - transcriptional hilD activation could be key event in Salmonella invasion of epithelial cells .
We expect Hfq to have further roles in SPI - 1 expression since the protein seems to bind to many mRNAs encoded by this pathogenicity island ( Figures 4 and S4 ) .
Interestingly , SPI - 1 has a significantly higher AT content than the rest of the S. Typhimurium chromosome [ 40 ] , predicting that SPI - 1 mRNAs are AU - rich .
Coincidently , Hfq primarily recognizes AU - rich single - stranded regions in RNAs [ 12,94,95,96 ] .
This type of sequence is also recognized by the major endoribonuclease , RNase E , and Hfq has been shown to protect certain RNAs by competitive binding to RNase E sites [ 97,98 ] .
It is tempting to speculate that Hfq could reduce the impact of DNA from foreign sources by controlling expression of newly acquired AT - rich genes at the RNA level , similar to the role of the H - NS DNA - binding protein in controlling such genes at the DNA level [ 99,100,101 ] .
Collectively , the present study provides the first picture of the impact of Hfq on Salmonella gene expression at both the transcriptional and post - transcriptional level .
We believe that more detailed inspection of this freely available data set , in particular of the remaining ,60 % of the chromosome that remains to be fully analyzed , as well as sampling under different growth - conditions , will expand the gamut of Salmonella small mRNA and noncoding RNA genes .
In addition , the available data sets should help to discover whether Hfq controls the expression of cis - antisense sRNAs that overlap with mRNA coding regions [ 54 ] , or whether certain Salmonella tRNAs are selectively associated with this protein [ 22,23 ] .
Bacterial genomes encode a large number of RNA binding proteins [ 102 ] , including globally acting proteins such as the CsrA/RsmA [ 48 ] and Csp families [ 103 ] .
Our generic method will identify the RNA targets of these proteins in any genetically tractable bacterium .
Materials and Methods Bacterial Strains , Plasmids , and Oligodeoxynucleotides The Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains used in this study were : JVS - 0255 ( Dhfq : : Cm R , [ 32 ] ) , JVS - 1338 ( hfq FLAG , [ 46 ] ) , and the isogenic wild - type strain SL1344 [ 104 ] .

Co - immunoprecipitation was carried out using the protocol published in [ 46 ] .
For pyrosequencing and coIP - on - Chip experiments , samples of two independent pull down experiments were used .
cDNA cloning and pyrosequencing was performed as described for the identification of eukaryotic microRNA [ 109 ] but omitting size - fractionation of RNA prior to cDNA synthesis .
Microarrays used for the coIP - on - Chip experiments were designed and produced by Oxford Gene Technology ( Kidlington , UK ) .
They consist of 21,939 60 - mer oligonucleotides tiled throughout the S. Typhimurium SL1344 NCTC13347 genome and 636 control oligonucleotides .
The SL1344 sequence was obtained from the Sanger Institute ( Hinxton , UK ) website ( http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Salmonella/ ) .
As this genome is not yet fully annotated , the oligonucleotides were associated with corresponding S. Typhimurium LT2 genes or intergenic regions , if conserved in both organisms .
Full description of the microarray and protocols used for generating and analysing the data are associated with the dataset deposited in the GEO data repository ( http://www.ncbi .
nlm.nih.gov / geo / ) under accession number GSE10149 .
For detailed description of data analysis using the Integrated Genome Browser see the Supplementary Text S1 .
In brief , cDNA reads $ 18 nt were mapped to the Salmonella chromosome and hits per nucleotide were calculated along the entire genome .
To calculate enrichment factors for Hfq coIP , the Hfq cDNA number was divided by Control cDNA number at each position of the genome , following normalization to the total number of mapped reads .
Upon upload of the Salmonella genome sequence and annotation from Genbank ( .
gff ) , the two graphs for each library were loaded into the Integrated Genome Browser ( IGB ) of Affymetrix ( version IGB - 4.56 ) , which can be directly launched by Java Web Start at http://www.affymetrix .
