When activated , the SsrB response regulator directly promotes the transcription of multiple genes within Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 ( SPI - 2 ) .
As expression of the SsrB protein is promoted by several transcription factors , including SsrB itself , the expression of SPI - 2 genes can increase to undesirable levels under activating conditions .
Here , we report that Salmonella can avoid the hyperactivation of SPI - 2 genes by using ptsN - encoded EIIA Ntr , a component of the nitrogen - metabolic phosphotransferase system .
Under SPI - 2 -- inducing conditions , the levels of SsrB - regulated gene transcription increased abnormally in a ptsN deletion mutant , whereas they decreased in a strain overexpressing EIIA Ntr .
We found that EIIA Ntr controls SPI - 2 genes by acting on the SsrB protein at the posttranscriptional level .
EIIA Ntr interacted directly with SsrB , which prevented the SsrB protein from binding to its target promoter .
Finally , the Salmonella strain , either lacking the ptsN gene or overexpressing EIIA Ntr , was unable to replicate within macrophages , and the ptsN deletion mutant was attenuated for virulence in mice .
These results indicated that normal SPI - 2 gene expression maintained by an EIIA Ntr -- SsrB interaction is another determinant of Salmonella virulence .
virulence gene regulation  nitrogen - metabolic phosphotransferase system ( PTS )  protein -- protein interaction During systemic infection of mammalian hosts , Salmonella employs two distinct type III secretion systems ( TTSSs ) to modify the host cell response .
The first system is encoded by genes clustered in Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI - 1 ) and translocates SPI - 1 -- encoded effector proteins to mediate invasion into host cells ( 1 ) .
When engulfed by macrophages , Salmonella cells express the second TTSS and its substrate effectors from SPI - 2 ; this step inhibits the bacteria - killing processes that occur inside macrophages , thus facilitating the survival of Salmonella ( 2 ) .
The expression of SPI - 2 genes is under the control of several transcription factors .
Among them , the SsrA/SsrB two - component system , which is encoded by the ssrA and ssrB genes located within SPI - 2 , seems to have the most direct effect on SPI - 2 expression .
The purified C terminus of SsrB binds to multiple promoters of SPI - 2 genes encoding the TTSS and secreted effectors ( 3 ) .
As the SsrB protein is a response regulator , the DNA - binding activity , which is controlled by the phosphorylation state ( 4 ) , the cognate sensor kinase , SsrA , should be activated to phosphorylate the SsrB protein within macrophages .
Although such phagosomal signals promoting the SsrA activity have not yet been identified , the SsrB - regulated genes are expressed in Salmonella cells grown in minimal - medium at acidic pH and/or with low Mg 2 + concentration ( 5 -- 8 ) .
Similar to many other two - component regulatory systems , the expression of SsrA/SsrB is positively autoregulated ; the SsrB protein binds to ssrA and ssrB promoters and activates their transcription ( 4 ) .
The OmpR and PhoP proteins ( response regulators of the OmpR/EnvZ and PhoP/PhoQ two - component systems , respectively ) also control the expression levels of SsrA and SsrB .
The OmpR regulator directly activates the transcription of ssrA and ssrB genes ( 9 ) , whereas the PhoP protein does so for ssrB transcription and controls ssrA gene expression at the posttranscriptional level via an as yet undetermined mechanism ( 10 ) .
Recently , small DNA - binding proteins that negatively control the transcription of SPI - 2 genes have been discovered .
One is the histone - like protein , H - NS , which selectively represses the transcription of horizontally acquired genes in Salmonella resulting from its association with AT - rich regions of these loci ( 11 ) .
Consistent with these findings , the H - NS protein represses expression of the SsrB - target genes within SPI - 2 , which is relieved by activation of the SsrB protein ( 3 ) .
Another small protein , YdgT , also functions as a negative regulator of SPI - 2 expression ; deletion of the ydgT gene increases transcription levels of the SsrB - regulated SPI - 2 genes ( 12 ) .
The ydgT mutant strain is attenuated for virulence in mice , suggesting that the maintenance of appropriate SPI - 2 expression level may be another determinant of Salmonella pathogenesis ( 12 , 13 ) .
Together with enzyme I Ntr ( EI Ntr ) and Npr , enzyme IIA Ntr ( EIIA Ntr ) is assumed to constitute the nitrogen - metabolic phosphotransferase system ( PTS ) .
Unlike enzymes II of the carbohydrate PTS , which have been implicated in various physiological events ( 14 , 15 ) , substantially less is known about the functions of EIIA Ntr .
InEscherichia coli , theptsN gene encoding EIIA Ntr was identified as a suppressor of some lethal phenotypes ; inactivation of the ptsN gene recovered viability of an era mutant lacking essential GTPase activity ( 16 ) , whereas overexpression of EIIA Ntr compensated for the loss of σ E activity ( 17 ) .
In addition , E. coli EIIA Ntr was reported to interact directly with the TrkA potassium ( K + ) transporter and the KdpD sensor kinase to control cytoplasmic K + levels ( 18 , 19 ) .

107  no. 47 www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1000759107 In the present study , we showed that EIIA Ntr acts on the SsrB response regulator and allows SPI - 2 genes to be expressed at normal levels under inducing conditions .
Here , we present evidence that EIIA Ntr interacts with the SsrB protein to relieve its binding to the SPI - 2 promoter .
We demonstrated that in the absence of EIIA Ntr , Salmonella overexpresses SPI - 2 genes and is attenuated for virulence in a mammalian host .
Results EIIA Ntr Negatively Controls the Expression of SPI - 2 Genes .
The ptsN gene encodes EIIA Ntr , a component of the nitrogen - metabolic PTS ( 20 ) .
Because it has been reported that EIIA Ntr performs gene regulatory function in E. coli ( 18 , 19 ) and Pseudomonas putida ( 21 ) , we wanted to search for Salmonella genes whose expression levels are affected by EIIA Ntr .
We conducted DNA microarray analysis using RNA isolated from wild - type and ptsN deletion strains grown in Luria -- Bertani broth ( LB ) medium to stationary - phase .
In the absence of EIIA Ntr , the transcription levels of various SPI - 2 genes encoding TTSS and its substrate effector proteins increased by two - to threefold ( Table S1 ) .
The expression of SPI - 2 genes is induced in Salmonella grown in minimal media at acidic pH but repressed at neutral pH ( 6 , 22 ) .
We grew the wild - type and ptsN deletion strains harboring a lacZ fusion to either the ssaG or sseA promoter in M9 minimal medium adjusted to pH 7.0 or 5.8 .
We found that the growth of the strains was similar at respective pH values ( Fig .
In the wild - type strain grown in acidified minimal - medium , the transcription levels of ssaG and sseA genes were induced after 4 h , reaching the maximum by 6 h ( Fig. 1A ) .
In contrast , in the ptsN deletion strain , the expression of these two genes was promoted after only 2 h and increased continuously to levels about fivefold higher than those of the wild - type strain by 10 h ( Fig. 1A ) .
Note that the regulatory effect of EIIA Ntr required a low pH because deregulation of the ssaG and sseA genes resulting from ptsN deletion did not occur at neutral pH ( Fig. 1A ) .
By qRT - PCR , we determined that overexpression of SPI - 2 genes in the ptsN mutant was indeed due to the lack of EIIA Ntr .
Under acidic growth conditions , the ssaR , sseB , sseE , and ssrB mRNA levels were 9 - to 13 - fold higher in the absence of ptsN than in its presence ; these levels were restored by expression of EIIA Ntr from a low - copy number plasmid ( Fig. 1B ) .
Consistent with the transcription data , the SPI - 2 protein expression levels were also altered by deletion of the ptsN gene .
The ptsN deletion strain showed much higher levels of SsrB protein expression than the wild - type strain , but introduction of the EIIA Ntr - expressing plasmid restored the wildtype levels ( Fig. 1C ) .
To examine whether EIIA Ntr overexpression could repress SPI - 2 transcription , we constructed pJJ14 in which EIIA Ntr was expressed from the lac promoter of a multicopy plasmid .
When the wild - type strains carrying a lacZ fusion with either the ssaG or sseA gene and harboring the plasmid pJJ14 were grown in acidified minimal - medium , the transcription levels of these two genes decreased by 2.4 - fold on addition of isopropyl - β-D - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) ( Fig .
Taken together , these results indicated that under SPI - 2 -- inducing conditions , EIIA Ntr negatively regulates SPI - 2 genes , resulting in their expression at the appropriate levels .
EIIA Ntr - Mediated Regulation of SPI - 2 Genes Requires SsrB Protein .
As the DNA - binding activity of EIIA Ntr has not been reported , the regulatory function of EIIA Ntr would be mediated by a transcription factor ( s ) controlling the expression of SPI - 2 genes .
We hypothesized that the EIIA Ntr - mediated control of SPI - 2 expression could be dependent on SsrB , a response regulator of the SsrA/SsrB two - component system , because this protein is known to be a key regulator that directly activates the transcription of multiple SPI - 2 genes ( 3 ) .
Moreover , ssrB is one of the SPI - 2 genes showing increased expression level in the ptsN deletion MICROBIOLOGY Fig. 1 .
EIIA Ntr is necessary for normal expression of SPI - 2 genes under their inducing conditions .
( A ) Transcription levels of the ssaG and sseA genes were determined by β - galactosidase assay .
Overnight cultures of the wild - type ( WT ) and ptsN deletion ( ΔptsN ) strains carrying a transcriptional ssaG -- lacZ ( P4P70 , SR3207 ) or sseA -- lacZ ( SR3266 , SR3267 ) fusion construct on the chromosome were diluted in M9 - minimal - medium adjusted to pH 7.0 or 5.8 , and β - galactosidase activity ( Miller units ) was determined at the designated time points .
( B ) mRNA levels of SPI - 2 genes , ssaR , sseB , sseE , and ssrB , were determined by qRT - PCR .
The wild - type ( SL1344 ) and ptsN deletion ( SR3203 ) strains and the SR3203 strain harboring the pJJ11 plasmid ( i.e. , a low - copy number plasmid expressing EIIA Ntr ) were grown in M9 - minimal - medium at pH - 5.8 to stationary - phase .
( A and B ) Values shown are the means and SD of three independent experiments .
( C ) Western blotting analysis was performed on cell extracts prepared from the wild - type ( SR3002 ) , ΔptsN ( SR3251 ) , and pJJ11 - harboring SR3251 strains , which were grown in M9 - minimal - medium at pH - 5.8 .
107  no. 47  20507 strain ( Fig. 1 B and C ) .
Consistent with previous reports ( 3 , 6 , 23 ) , deletion of the ssrB gene markedly impaired transcriptional activation of the ssaG gene at acidic pH ( i.e. , 11 - fold reduction ; Fig. 2A ) .
We showed that the absence of SsrB abolished the regulatory effect of EIIA Ntr on SPI - 2 gene expression .
Under acidic pH conditions , the strain harboring the functional ssrB gene but lacking the ptsN gene overexpressed ssaG , whereas the ptsN mutation failed to increase the levels of ssaG gene transcription in the absence of SsrB ( Fig. 2A ) .
EIIA Ntr Controls the SsrB Protein at the Posttranscriptional Level .
These observations raise the question of how ssrB expression was increased in the ptsN deletion strain .
EIIA Ntr may repress ssrB transcription .
Alternatively , as the ssrB gene is positively autoregulated ( 4 ) , the lack of EIIA Ntr negatively controlling the stability and/or activity of the SsrB protein may result in overexpression of ssrB .
If the latter case were true , the ptsN deletion would still activate further transcription of SsrB - regulated targets , even with expression of the ssrB gene from a heterologous promoter .
In the ssrB deletion strain harboring the pJJ16 plasmid in which the SsrB protein was induced from the lac promoter , transcription of the ssaG gene recovered in acidified medium containing IPTG ( Fig. 2B ) .
Under the same experimental conditions , however , the lack of EIIA Ntr again increased the transcription level of the ssaG gene by sevenfold ( Fig. 2B ) .
Therefore , our findings suggest that EIIA Ntr negatively controls ssrB gene expression at the posttranscriptional level , which in turn down - regulates the transcription of SsrB - regulated genes including ssrB itself .
T25 -- EIIA Ntr fusion protein and T18 fragment ( Fig. 3A ) .
This result indicated that EIIA Ntr interacts with SsrB to complement adenylate cyclase activity .
The EIIA Ntr -- SsrB interaction was likely to be specific because coexpression of the T25 -- EIIA Ntr and T18 -- SsrA sensor fusion failed to promote lacZ expression over the control ( Fig. 3A ) .
Next , we investigated EIIA Ntr -- SsrB interaction in - vitro using purified proteins .
We used the SsrB protein carrying thioredoxin fusion at its N terminus because this fusion facilitated overexpression of SsrB and increased SsrB solubility for protein purification .
Note that expression of the thioredoxin - fused SsrB protein was able to restore ssaG transcription in ssrB mutant , indicating that the thioredoxin fusion did not interfere with regulatory function of SsrB ( Fig .
We examined real - time interaction between EIIA Ntr and SsrB using the surface plasmon resonance technique .
When the SsrB protein was allowed to flow over a CM5 sensor chip with immobilized EIIA Ntr , we could observe SsrB - binding to EIIA Ntr ( Fig. 3B ) .
In contrast , when SsrB was exposed to immobilized EIIA Glc , an enzyme II of the carbohydrate PTS , no interaction was detected between these two proteins ( Fig. 3B ) .
Taken together , the data demonstrate that EIIA Ntr specifically binds to the SsrB response regulator .
EIIA Ntr Prevents the SsrB Protein from Binding to Its Target Promoter .
Binding of transcription factors to target promoters is an essential step for controlling gene expression .
Thus , we explored EIIA Ntr Interacts with the SsrB Protein .
EIIA Ntr has been reported to bind directly to the TrkA and KdpD proteins and to control K + homeostasis in E. coli ( 18 , 19 ) .
Therefore , we investigated whether Salmonella EIIA Ntr interacts with the SsrB protein using a bacterial two - hybrid system ( 24 ) .
We constructed two plasmids in which EIIA Ntr and SsrB were expressed as forms fused to the T25 and T18 catalytic domains , respectively , of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase .
Indeed , the coexpression of these two fusion proteins in the E. coli strain lacking endogenous adenylate cyclase activity resulted in about 95 - fold higher levels of β - galactosidase activity compared with the control expressing the Fig. 2 .
EIIA Ntr controls SPI - 2 genes by acting on the SsrB protein at the posttranscriptional level .
Transcription levels of the ssaG gene were determined by β - galactosidase activities ( Miller units ) expressed from strains harboring a lacZ - transcriptional - fusion to the ssaG gene .
( A ) The wild - type ( P4P70 ) strain and strains with deletion of the ptsN ( SR3207 ) , ssrB ( SR4001 ) , and both ptsN and ssrB ( SR4002 ) genes carrying an ssaG -- lacZ fusion were grown in M9 - minimal - medium at pH - 5.8 .
( B ) The ΔssrB ( SR4001 ) and ΔptsNΔssrB ( SR4002 ) strains harboring a ssaG -- lacZ fusion and the plasmid pJJ16 in which the SsrB protein is expressed from the lac promoter were grown in M9 - minimal - medium at pH - 5.8 with or without 2 μM IPTG .
Values shown are the means and SD of three independent experiments .
EIIA Ntr interacts with the SsrB protein both in - vivo and in - vitro .
( A ) EIIA Ntr -- SsrB interaction was assessed using a bacterial two - hybrid system ( 24 ) .
β - Galactosidase activity ( Miller units ) was determined in E. coli BTH101 strains harboring plasmids coexpressing T25 - EIIA Ntr and T18 ( pT25 - ptsN + pT18 ) , T25 - Zip and T18 - Zip ( pT25 - zip + pT18 - zip ) , T25 - EIIA Ntr and T18 - SsrB ( pT25 - ptsN + pT18 - ssrB ) , and T25 - EIIA Ntr and T18 - SsrA ( pT25 - ptsN + pT18 - ssrA ) .
Values shown are the means ± SD of three independent experiments .
( B ) Interaction between SsrB and EIIA Ntr was examined by conducting surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy .
Purified EIIA Ntr and EIIA Glc ( a control protein ) were immobilized on the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5 chip at 1.5 ng/mm 2 concentration .
SsrB ( 4.5 ng/μL ) was allowed to flow over the EIIA Ntr and EIIA Glc surfaces for 10 min in each sensorgram .
The red - lined sensorgram indicated strong SsrB - binding to EIIA Ntr , whereas no interaction was detected between SsrB and EIIA Glc ( blue - lined sensorgram ) .
20508  www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1000759107 Choi et al. did prevent SsrB from binding to the target DNA : as the concentrations of EIIA Ntr increased in the reactions , the levels of the SsrB -- DNA complex decreased to generate the free ssaG promoter DNA ( Fig. 4B , lanes 3 -- 6 ) .
This result was not due to competition between SsrB and EIIA Ntr for DNA binding because EIIA Ntr alone was unable to bind to the ssaG promoter ( Fig .
Therefore , these results suggest that interaction between the SsrB protein and EIIA Ntr prevents SsrB binding to its target promoters , and thus reduces SPI - 2 gene transcription levels .
EIIA Ntr inhibits SsrB - binding to target promoter .
EMSA experiments were conducted to examine interaction between the SsrB protein and the ssaG promoter .
( A ) The SsrB protein was incubated with the 5 ′ end - labeled ssaG promoter DNA ( 2.5 fmol ) in the presence or absence of the unlabeled DNA probe .
Concentrations of SsrB and cold probe in the reactions were indicated on top of the figure .
( B ) The SsrB protein was incubated with the radio - labeled DNA fragments containing ssaG promoter in the presence or absence of EIIA Ntr .
Amounts of SSrB and EIIA Ntr in the reactions are described at the Top .
whether the EIIA Ntr -- SsrB interaction could interfere with SsrB binding to the target promoter by conducting electrophoretic mobility - shift assay ( EMSA ) experiments .
When the SsrB protein was incubated with 5 ′ end - labeled DNA probes , it bound to the ssaG promoter DNA to form the SsrB -- DNA complex ( Fig. 4A , lane 3 ) .
This SsrB binding was specific because the unlabeled ssaG promoter DNA in the reaction competed with the labeled probe for SsrB - binding ( Fig. 4A , lanes 4 -- 6 ) .
Interestingly , EIIA Ntr Salmonella Lacking EIIA Ntr - Controlled SPI - 2 Expression Shows Attenuated Virulence .
Expression of SPI - 2 is required for the survival and replication of Salmonella within macrophages ( 25 ) .
When infected with murine macrophages , the wild - type strain replicated , but the ptsN deletion mutant failed to do so 18 h after phagocytosis ( Fig. 5A ) .
This was not due to phagocytic differences between these two strains because the numbers for both strains within macrophages were similar at 30 min postinfection ( Fig. 5A ) .
This phenotypic defect of the ptsN mutant was due to the lack of EIIA Ntr because expression of the ptsN gene from a lowcopy number plasmid enabled the mutant strain to replicate within macrophages ( Fig. 5A ) .
Next , we overexpressed EIIA Ntr in the wild - type strain and found that this also prevented intraphagosomal growth of Salmonella ( Fig. 5B ) .
Therefore , our data suggest that both the loss of normal SPI - 2 expression by ptsN deletion and the reduced SPI - 2 activity by EIIA Ntr overexpression impair Salmonella replication within macrophages .
As Salmonella should survive within macrophages during systemic infection of mammalian hosts , the ptsN mutant strain could be attenuated for virulence in mice .
We inoculated the wild - type or ptsN deletion strain into a group of 10 mice via the i.p. route .
All of the mice infected with wild - type Salmonella died within 9 d , whereas deletion of the ptsN gene prolonged the mean survival time by 6 d ( Fig. 5C ) .
We further verified the virulence phenotype of the ptsN deletion mutant by counting bacterial cells in the liver and spleen .
Five days after infection , MICROBIOLOGY Fig. 5 .
Virulence phenotypes displayed by the Salmonella strains lacking or overexpressing the ptsN gene .
( A ) Macrophages J774A .1 were infected with the wild - type ( SL1344 ) and ΔptsN ( SR3203 ) strains and SR3203 strain harboring the plasmid pJJ11 .
The numbers of gentamicin - resistant bacteria were determined at 30 min ( indicated as 0 h ) and 18 h after phagocytosis .
( B ) Gentamicin protection assay was conducted using the wild - type strain ( SL1344 ) carrying the empty vector or the plasmid pJJ14 .
( C and D ) BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally infected with the wild - type ( SL1344 ) and ptsN deletion ( SR3203 ) strains .
Survival of mice was monitored daily ( C ) , and the numbers of bacteria in the spleen and liver were determined ( D ) .
107  no. 47  20509 the numbers of ptsN - deleted Salmonella were 1,000 - and 100 - fold lower than those of the wild - type bacteria in the spleen and liver , respectively ( Fig. 5D ) .
Thus , our results indicate that EIIA Ntr is necessary for virulence of Salmonella in mice .
Discussion Once engulfed by macrophages , intracellular pathogens face harsh environments within the phagosome .
By using the SPI - 2 -- encoded TTSS , Salmonella translocates various effector proteins into the cytoplasm of a host cell to interfere with the bacteriakilling events ( 26 ) .
In this study , we demonstrated that EIIA Ntr , a component of the nitrogen - metabolic PTS encoded by the ptsN gene , is necessary for SPI - 2 genes to be expressed at the appropriate levels under their inducing conditions , and that lack of this regulation attenuates Salmonella virulence during systemic infection of mice .
In addition to genes encoding a TTSS , as well as effector proteins , SPI - 2 possesses the ssrA and ssrB genes that express the SsrA/SsrB two - component regulatory system .
The response regulator , SsrB , binds directly to the promoters and activates transcription of gene clusters within SPI - 2 ( 3 ) .
In a strain lacking EIIA Ntr , we found that the levels of SsrB - regulated gene expression were abnormally elevated under SPI - 2 -- inducing conditions ( Fig. 1 ) .
These observations raised questions regarding how EIIA Ntr maintains the expression of SPI - 2 genes at the appropriate levels .
On the basis of several observations , we propose that EIIA Ntr binds directly to the SsrB protein to relieve SsrB - binding to its target promoters .
First , EIIA Ntr - mediated regulation of SPI - 2 genes was dependent on the SsrB protein because ptsN mutation failed to increase SPI - 2 expression in the absence of SsrB ( Fig. 2A ) .
Second , EIIA Ntr negatively controlled SsrB at the posttranscriptional level because the ptsN deletion strain could still overexpress SPI - 2 genes even when the SsrB protein was expressed from a heterologous promoter ( Fig. 2B ) .
Third , EIIA Ntr interacted with SsrB in - vivo and in - vitro ( Fig. 3 ) .
Fourth , EIIA Ntr prevented binding of SsrB to its target promoters ( Fig. 4B ) .
However , as the SsrB protein should be phosphorylated to function as a transcription factor ( 4 ) , we can not exclude the possibility that the EIIA Ntr -- SsrB interaction may inhibit SsrA - mediated phosphorylation of SsrB or promote dephosphorylation of phosphorylated SsrB .
Indeed , in Bacillus subtilis , the RapH protein promotes dephosphorylation of the Spo0A response regulator in - vitro ( 27 ) .
Although a sensor kinase and its cognate response regulator represent a basic two - component system mediating bacterial signal transduction , many proteins called `` connectors '' have been identified in two - component systems .
Through an interaction with a sensor kinase or response regulator , connector proteins can modulate many steps affecting their activities ( 28 ) .
ComA , a response regulator of the ComA/ComP two - component system , activates the development of competence in B. subtilis .
Similar to the role of Salmonella EIIA Ntr for SsrB , the Rap protein family members RapC , RapF , and RapH bind to the ComA protein and inhibit its binding to target promoter DNA ( 27 , 29 , 30 ) .
The kdpFABC operon encodes the high - affinity K + transporter KdpFABC , and its expression is regulated by the KdpD / KdpE two - component system .
The E. coli EIIA Ntr controls kdpFABC transcription via direct interaction with the KdpD / KdpE two - component system ( 19 ) .
However , unlike the Salmonella EIIA Ntr interaction with the SsrB response regulator , the E. coli homolog binds to the KdpD sensor protein and stimulates its kinase activity , thereby increasing the levels of phosphorylated KdpE ( 19 ) .
In this sense , EIIA Ntr seems to be a connector protein acting on a sensor kinase and response regulator of different twocomponent systems .
In the nitrogen - metabolic PTS , a phosphoryl group on EI Ntr is finally transferred to EIIA Ntr through NPr .
The interactions between EIIA Ntr and its partner proteins are determined by the phosphorylation state of EIIA Ntr .
For interaction with the TrkA or KdpD protein , EIIA Ntr should be dephosphorylated ( 18 , 19 ) .
We found that Salmonella EIIA Ntr carrying a mutation in the putative phosphorylation site ( i.e. , H73A substitution ) can still interact with SsrB in - vivo and maintain the normal levels of SPI - 2 gene expression ( Fig .
S5 A and B ) .
Moreover , phosphorylated EIIA Ntr could also bind to the SsrB protein in - vitro ( Fig .
Thus , these results suggest that EIIA Ntr performs SPI - 2 regulatory function regardless of its phosphorylation state .
Over the course of infection , Salmonella often uses two - component regulatory systems to sense signals within host cells and to promote the expression of genes that are necessary for intracellular survival .
Thus , the inactivation of regulatory systems playing such roles would result in impairment of bacterial virulence .
The PhoP protein is a response regulator of the PhoP / PhoQ two - component system and plays a key role in Salmonella pathogenesis ( 31 ) .
The Salmonella pho - 24 mutant , in which the PhoP protein is constitutively activated due to a mutation in PhoQ , and a strain that lacks the surge of PhoP activity by elimination of a positive feedback loop from the phoPQ operons , are attenuated for virulence in mice ( 32 , 33 ) .
These results suggest that the controlled activity of regulatory systems is another determinant of bacterial virulence .
Recently , transcription of SPI - 2 genes was reported to be negatively controlled by small regulatory proteins , such as YdgT and H - NS ( 7 ) .
Under noninducing conditions , these proteins are likely to be associated with regulatory regions of SPI - 2 to silence gene transcription ( 12 , 13 ) .
When activated within macrophages , the SsrB protein promotes transcription of SPI - 2 , possibly by counteracting the H - NS -- and YdgT - mediated repression ( 7 ) .
Indeed , deletion of the ydgT gene attenuated Salmonella virulence in a mouse infection model , which may have resulted from the expression of SPI - 2 genes with inappropriate timing ( i.e. , under repressing conditions ) and/or at inappropriate levels under inducing conditions ( 12 , 34 ) .
The expression levels of SsrB are regulated by at least three response regulators .
The SsrB protein increases its own levels via positive autoregulation ( 4 ) and the OmpR and PhoP proteins also do so by directly activating ssrB transcription ( 9 , 10 ) .
Due to these multiple positive feedback loops converging on SsrB expression , without a means to control the levels of activated SsrB protein , SPI - 2 genes would be expressed ectopically within phagosomes where the signals activating these response regulators exist .
The results of the present study indicated that EIIA Ntr prevents SPI - 2 genes from being expressed at undesirable levels under their activating conditions , the loss of which consequently attenuates Salmonella virulence during systemic infection of an animal host .
Finally , we notice the possibility that the alternative sigma factor σ E might enhance EIIA Ntr - mediated SPI - 2 gene regulation inside macrophages .
σ E is required for Salmonella 's resistance to phagosomal defense molecules such as oxidative - stress and antimicrobial peptides ( 35 , 36 ) , and thus a Salmonella mutant lacking σ E is attenuated for survival within macrophages and virulence in mice ( 35 , 37 ) .
Moreover , it was shown that antimicrobial peptides can activate σ E ( 36 ) .
Interestingly , in E. coli , overexpression of σ E promotes ptsN transcription , indicating that the ptsN gene is amemberofσ E regulon ( 38 ) .
Taken together , during Salmonella 's growth inside macrophages , σ E activated by the phagosomal stresses could enhance EIIA Ntr expression , which tightly controls timing and/or levels of SPI - 2 expression .

The promoter DNA was purified from agarose gels using a gel extraction kit ( Qiagen ) .
The labeled DNA probe ( 2.5 fmol ) was incubated with the thioredoxin - fused SsrB protein in the presence or absence of EIIA Ntr -- His 6 at 37 °C for 30 min in 20 μL of binding buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7.5 , 50 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2.5 % glycerol ) containing 50 ng/μL poly ( dI - dC ) .
The reaction mixtures were resolved by 6 % PAGE , and the radiolabeled DNA fragments were visualized using a BAS2500 system ( Fuji Film ) .
Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy .
Real - time interaction of SsrB with EIIA Ntr or EIIA Glc was monitored via surface plasmon resonance detection by using a BIAcore 3000 system ( BIAcore ) with some modifications as described previously ( 18 ) .
EIIA Ntr and EIIA Glc were immobilized onto the carboxymethylated dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip , respectively .
EIIA Ntr and EIIA Glc ( 100 μL , 10 μg/mL ) in coupling buffer ( 10 mM sodium acetate , pH 5.0 ) were allowed to flow over the sensor chip at 5 μL/min to couple the proteins to the matrix by a N - hydroxysuccinimide/1 - ethyl -3 ′ - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide reaction ( 80 μL of mixture ) .
On the basis of the assumption that 1,000 resonance units ( RUs ) correspond to a surface concentration of 1 ng/mm 2 , EIIA Glc and EIIA Ntr were immobilized to surface concentration of 1.5 ng/mm 2 , respectively .
The standard running buffer was 10 mM Hepes ( pH 7.2 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0.5 mM EDTA , and all reagents were introduced at a flow rate of 10 μL/min .
The sensor surface was regenerated between assays by using the standard running buffer at a flow rate of 100 μL/min for 10 min to remove bound analytes .
