Transcriptional activation of the spvABCD operon occurs during stationary growth phase and is mediated by the regulatory gene product SpvR .
We have previously shown that expression of a spvRAB ' - cat fusion in Escherichia coli was dependent on the katF ( rpoS ) locus which encodes an alternative sigma factor ( crS ) .
The katF gene from SalmoneUla typhimurium has been cloned , sequenced , and used to construct Salmonella katF mutants by allelic replacement .
Using these mutants , we demonstrated by mRNA and gene fusion analyses that ors , in conjunction with SpvR , controls the transcription of the regulatory gene spvR .
In a second series of experiments , we sought to clarify the relationship between rs and SpvR in the control of spvABCD transcription .
It was shown that expression of a transcriptional spvAB ' - lacZ fusion could be restored in E. coli and Salmonella katF mutants when spvR was expressed in trans from an exogenous promoter .
Moreover , identical spvA mRNA startpoints were detected in katF + and katF strains .
These results indicate that the reduction of spvABCD transcription in katF mutants is mainly due to decreased expression of spvR .
Finally , mouse inoculation studies with S. typhimurium katF mutants of both wild - type and virulence plasmid - cured strains suggest that katF contributes to Salmonella virulence via the regulation of chromosomal genes in addition to that of spv genes .
The spvRABCD genes are carried by the virulence plasmids of the most virulent nontyphoidal serovars of Salmonella strains and are required for the induction of a systemic disease in mice ( 11 ) .
The precise function of the spvABCD genes is still unknown , but these genes may increase the growth - rate of Salmonella strains in host cells and affect the interaction of Salmonella strains with the host immune system ( 6 , 11 , 12 ) .
Analysis of the regulation of spv gene expression was initiated with the finding that the spvR - encoded product was homologous to MetR , a member of the LysR family of positive regulatory proteins ( 30 , 34 ) .
Various studies have shown that the spvABCD genes form an operon regulated by the SpvR protein ( 11 ) .
Gel mobility - shift assays indicated that SpvR specifically bound to a fragment containing the spvA promoter ( s ) ( 21 ) .
In vitro , the expression of the spvABCD operon was specifically induced when the bacteria were in stationary growth phase or were cultivated under a number of stress conditions ( 5 , 7 , 43 ) .
Interestingly , it was recently shown that the expression of the spv genes is rapidly induced inside macrophages , epithelial cells , and hepatocytes ( 10 , 31 ) .
It remains to be determined whether this induction involves a specific signal that is common to the intracellular compartments of cells that are invaded by Salmonella strains or whether this activation is due to the numerous stresses that an intracellular environment is likely to impose on the bacteria .
The induction of spv gene expression during stationary growth phase led us to investigate the role of katF in spv gene regulation .

6852 In Escherichia coli , katF is involved in the selective expression of a large number of genes in stationary - phase and in the resistance of the bacteria to many stress conditions ( 13 , 18 , 38 ) .
From the nucleotide sequence of the katF gene , the gene product is believed to be an RNA polymerase cf factor ( 24 ) .
However , u activity was only recently detected for the KatF ( RpoS , & 38 , us ) product ( 26 , 42 ) .
us is a member of the RpoD - related protein family , and the structural similarity in the DNA binding regions of as may indicate that this protein is functionally similar to u70 ( 202 .
Consistent with that notion , in - vitro studies revealed that a and ( u70 proteins have some cross - specificity for promoter recognition ( 26 , 42 ) .
However , though the levels of U70 protein were shown to be almost constant throughout the growth phase of E. coli , the levels of the crs protein were found to increase during the stationary phase of growth ( 42 ) .
This growth phase regulation of as involves both transcriptional and posttranscriptional controls and is consistent with the fact that various us - dependent genes are induced during the stationary - phase ( 18 , 19 , 22 , 25 , 35 ) .
We have previously shown that spvRAB ' - cat and spvRA ' - lacZ - transcriptional - fusions are not fully expressed in E. coli katF mutants unless the E. coli katF gene is provided in trans ( 28 ) .
Using an insertional katF mutant of Salmonella typhimurium , Fang et al. ( 8 ) determined that katF is required for maximal expression of an spvRAB ' - lacZ translational fusion and for Salmonella virulence .
In the present study , we have tried to elucidate the relationship between katF and spvR in growth phase - dependent regulation of the spvABCD genes .
Firstly , we cloned and sequenced the katF gene of S. typhimurium .
Secondly , Salmonella katF mutants were constructed , and these were used to demonstrate that both as and SpvR are required for the transcription of the regulatory gene spvR .
Finally , complementation experiments using the katF mutants VOL .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains , plasmids , and growth - conditions .
Strains and plasmids used in the study are listed in Table 1 .
Strains were routinely grown at 37 °C in Luria broth medium ( LB ) ( 32 ) supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics .
These were carbenicillin at 100 , ug/ml , chloramphenicol at 30 , ug/ml , tetracycline at 20 jig/ml , and kanamycin at 100 , ug/ml .
Recombinant DNA techniques and methods for genetic exchange were as previously described ( 5 , 32 , 40 ) .
PCR amplification with the GeneAmp kit ( Perkin - Elmer Cetus ) was used to construct the spvR - lacZ fusion in pSTF13 ( Table 1 ) and to obtain fragments internal to the spvA , spvR , and katF genes .
The amplified fragments were recovered by electroelution and purified with Elutip columns ( Schleicher and Schuell ) .
Oligonucleotides were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems model 391 DNA synthesizer .
The double - 6854 KOWARZ ET AL. stranded Nested Deletion kit ( Pharmacia ) was used to construct exonuclease III deletions in the spvR promoter region of pSTC19 ( Table 1 ) .
The positions of the deletions were determined by DNA sequencing .
The nucleotide sequence was determined on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method ( 33 ) .
Sequencing of double - stranded DNA was performed with the Sequenase sequencing kit ( U.S. Biochemical Corp. ) and with universal or specific synthetic primers .
Nucleotide sequence data were analyzed with the Genetics Computer Group ( University of Wisconsin , Madison ) sequence analysis software package ( Data General UNIX computer at the Service d'Informatique Scientifique , Institut Pasteur ) .
Total cellular RNA from stationaryphase cultures ( optical density at 600 nm of 2 to 3 ) of S. typhimurium and E. coli grown at 37 °C in LB was extracted by the hot acid - phenol method ( 1 ) .
RNA was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of DNase I ( Pharmacia ; 0.3 U / , ug ) to further eliminate contamination by DNA .
For RNA slot blots , samples ( 1 and 7 , ug of RNA ) were heated for 5 min at 65 °C and spotted onto Immobilon - N membrane ( Millipore ) using a Bio - Dot microfiltration apparatus ( Bio - Rad ) .
Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 65 °C in the hybridization buffer RPN 131 ( Amersham ) .
Determination of the 5 ' ends of spvA mRNA was performed by primer - extension as described below .
An oligonucleotide complementary to the spvA start codon region ( 5 ' - GGTG GTCTGATTCATATTCATAAATAATGATGACTC - 3 ' ) was labeled at the 5 ' end with [ y - 32P ] ATP ( 110 TBq/mmol ; Amersham ) and T4 polynucleotide kinase ( Pharmacia ) .
The 32p labeled primer ( 106 cpm ) was hybridized with 100 , ug of total RNA .
The cDNA was extended at 42 °C for 1 h with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase ( Boehringer ) .
The length of the cDNA was measured with a DNA sequencing gel ( 33 ) .
Bacterial extracts for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were prepared as previously described ( 28 ) .
The amount of protein was measured by the Coomassie brilliant blue assay ( Pierce Chemical Co. ) .
The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was determined by the spectrophotometric method of Shaw ( 36 ) and was expressed as the change in A412 per minute per milligram of protein .
The 3 - galactosidase activity was measured as described by Miller ( 23 ) and was expressed in Miller units ( 23 ) .
Female C57BL/6 mice 5 to 6 weeks old were obtained from the Centre d'Elevage R. Janvier ( Le Genest Saint Isle , France ) and maintained in our animal facilities on a diet of mouse chow and water ad libitum .
Techniques for infecting mice by the oral route and methods for the evaluation of bacterial growth in the spleen have been reported previously ( 29 ) .
Prior to infection of the mice , the antigenic formulae of S. typhimurium strains were confirmed by slide agglutination using rabbit antisera specific for 0 - and H - antigen factors ( Diagnostics Pasteur ) and the plasmids harbored by the strains were verified .

RESULTS The katF gene of S. typhimurium : cloning , nucleotide sequence , and complementation of an E. coli katF mutant .
Plasmid pDEB2 containing the cloned E. coli katF gene ( Table 1 ) was used as a probe against S. typhimurium C52 total DNA J. BAc - rERIOL .
digested with various restriction endonucleases ( data not shown ) .
A 6 - kb BglII fragment from C52 DNA hybridized with the E. coli katF gene .
To clone the BglII fragment containing the C52 katF sequence , size - fractionated BglII fragments ( between 5 and 10 kb ) of C52 total DNA were ligated in the BamHI site of pACYC184 .
Recombinant plasmids were transformed into the E. coli MC1061K strain , which contains a chromosomal deletion removing the 3 ' end of katF from codon 71 ( Table 1 ) .
A 0.75 - kb fragment containing the 3 ' end of the E. coli katF gene ( from codon 84 ) was obtained by PCR amplification from plasmid pDEB2 and used as a probe to screen transformants by colony hybridization .
Two clones containing the recombinant plasmids pSTK1 and pSTK2 , respectively ( Fig. 1A ) , were selected .
Both plasmids contained a common 6 - kb BglII fragment cloned in both orientations in pACYC184 .
Hybridization of the DNA plasmid digests with the probe indicated that the katF sequence was localized to a 2.3 - kb BamHI - ScaI fragment ( Fig. 1A ) .
Complementation experiments using isogenic E. coli katF and katF + strains ( ZK918 and ZK916 , respectively ) containing chromosomal lacZ - transcriptional - fusions in the katF - regulated boL4 gene ( 2 , 13 ) were performed .
As shown in Fig. 1A , plasmids pSTK1 and pSTK2 restored wild - type levels of lacZ expression in the katF strain ZK918 .
The size of the chromosomal insert containing the Salmonella katF gene was further reduced by subcloning the 2.3 - kb BamHI - ScaI fragment in pACYC184 to generate plasmids pSTK4 and pSTK5 , which differed only in the orientation of the insert DNA but which both complemented the katF mutation of strain ZK918 ( Fig. 1A ) .
The lack of complementation observed with plasmid pSTK6 suggested that the HpaI restriction site was located within the S. typhimunium katF gene ( Fig. 1A ) .
Sequence analysis of the katF region using plasmid pUCK2 was undertaken ( Table 1 ) .
Figure 1B indicates the location of a 1,574 - bp sequence on pUCK2 .
Examination of the sequence showed one open reading frame of 990 bp located 7 bp downstream of a potential ribosome - binding site sequence AGGAG ( 37 ) ( Fig. 1B ) .
This open reading frame encoded a protein of 330 amino - acids with a predicted molecular weight of 38 kDa which showed levels of identity of 99 and 95 % with the KatF ( RpoS and as ) proteins of E. coli and Shigella flexneri , respectively ( 15 , 24 , 39 , 42 ) .
Thus , this protein was henceforth referred to as S. typhimurium as .
In E. coli , a gene encoding a lipoprotein precursor ( nlpD ) was recently identified upstream of katF ( 14 ) .
In the S. typhimurium katF upstream region , the 3 ' end of an open reading frame encoding a product 100 % identical to the E. coli NlpD carboxy - terminal part was detected ( Fig. 1B ) .
DNA sequencing downstream of the ScaI site on pUCK2 ( Fig. 1B ) further confirmed the presence of the nlpD gene and indicated that the ScaI site was located within the nlpD sequence .
Construction of Salmonella katF mutants .
Plasmid pUCK3Km ( Fig. 2A ) was used to construct katF mutants from both wild - type and virulence plasmid - cured strains of Salmonella ( C52 and C53 , respectively ) .
This plasmid contained a deletion of the 0.8 - kb HpaI - PstI fragment within the katF gene of S. typhimurium replaced by the 1.3 - kb HincII fragment encoding the kanamycin resistance ( kan ) gene from plasmid pUC4K ( Table 1 ) .
After electroporation in S. typhimurium , plasmid pUCK3Km appeared to be unstable .
Recombination of the kan cartridge into the host genome , with simultaneous loss of plasmid pUCK3Km , resulted in the isolation of clones that were resistant to kanamycin and sensitive to carbenicillin .
The Kmr CbS clones obtained from the Salmonella strains C52 ( pUCK3Km ) and C53 ( pUCK3Km ) were designated C52K and C53K , respectively .
To verify that the kan cartridge was VOL .

Values are the averages of at least three independent experiments .
The standard error of the mean is indicated in parentheses .

The thick line on the restriction map of pUCK2 shows the pUCK2 DNA region that was sequenced on both strands ( accession number X77752 ) .
The position and orientation of the relevant genes are indicated by open boxes and arrows , respectively , beneath the map .
Only part of the nlpD gene has been sequenced .
The nucleotide sequence of the katF gene from S. typhimurium 14028s was recently deposited in the GenBank database ( Z14965 ) .
The deduced amino - acid sequence of crs from strain 14028s is identical to that of strain C52 except for codon 53 .
The restriction sites shown are BamHI ( B ) , BglIl ( Bg ) , ClaI ( C ) , DraI ( D ) , EcoRV ( Ev ) , HpaI ( Hp ) , NruI ( N ) , PstI ( P ) , Sall ( S ) , and ScaI ( Sc ) .
inserted at the correct location in Salmonella strains C53K and C52K , Southern hybridization experiments in which plasmids pSTK1 and pUC4K were used as probes against total DNA from wild - type and derivative mutant Salmonella strains were undertaken .
Plasmid pSTK1 revealed a 6 - kb BglII fragment and two Clal fragments of 3.5 and 3.3 kb in C52 DNA ( Fig. 2B ) , whereas no hybridization was detected when pUC4K was used as a probe ( data not shown ) .
In the Salmonella mutant strain C52K , the size of the fragment carrying the katF gene was modified .
Since the kan cartridge contains a ClaI site but no BglII site ( Fig. 2A ) , the 6 - kb BglII fragment and the 3.3 - kb ClaI fragment , which contained the katF sequence and hybridized with the pSTK1 probe in the wild - type strain DNA , were converted respectively into a 6.5 - kb BglII fragment and two 2 - kb ClaI fragments in the mutant strain ( Fig. 2B ) .
Identical results were obtained for C53 and C53K DNA , respectively ( data not shown ) .
As expected , only the 6.5 - kb BglII fragment and the 2 - kb ClaI fragments were detected in C52K and C53K DNA when pUC4K was used as a probe ( data not shown ) .
Transcription of the spv genes in katF mutants of E. coli and S. typhimurium .
We have previously shown that the level of expression of an spvRAB ' - cat transcriptional - fusion was much lower in the E. coli katF strain ZK918 than in the isogenic katF + strain ZK916 ( 28 ) .
In addition , complementation was observed with the cloned katF gene of E. coli ( 28 ) .
Fang et al. ( 8 ) also observed that a katF mutation in Salmonella sp. resulted in decreased expression of a cloned translational spvRAB ' - lacZ fusion .
Since the transcription of the spvABCD operon is controlled by the SpvR regulatory protein ( 5 , 11 ) , it was of interest to determine whether a katF mutation would affect the expression of the spvR gene itself .
To compare the transcription levels of spvR in katF mutants and wild - type strains of E. coli and S. typhimunium , we used plasmid pSTF9 which carries a transcriptional - fusion , spvRAB ' - cat , cloned into the low - copy - number vector pVK100 ( Fig. 3 ) .
Total RNAs were isolated from stationary - phase cultures of Salmonella and E. coli strains containing pSTF9 and hybridized by dot blot with an spvR intragenic fragment used as a probe .
Plasmid pVK100 and fragments specific to the spvA , katF , and tet genes were used as probes in control experiments .
The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity expressed from the spvRAB ' - cat fusion on pSTF9 was also determined .
The results are presented in Fig. 4 .
As expected , transcription of the katF gene was detected only in the katF strains .
A decreased transcription of spvA , spvB ( spvRAB ' - cat ) , and spvR was observed in the katF strains of E. coli and Salmonella compared with that of wild - type strains .
This phenomenon appeared to be specific to spv genes and did not result from a variation in the copy number of pSTF9 , since the mRNAs expressed from pVK100 - borne genes ( e.g. , the tet gene ) were detected at similar levels in the katF mutants and in the wild - type strains .
In contrast to the vector pACYC177 ( data not shown ) , plasmid pSTK7 which carries the cloned S. typhimurium katF gene was able to restore wild - type transcription levels of spvR , spvA , and spvB in the katF mutant C53K ( Fig. 4 ) .
This confirmed that katF was required for maximal spvR and spvABCD transcription levels .
Interestingly , a significant basal level of spvR transcription was detected in the katF Salmonella mutant .

Expression of a cloned spvAB ' - lacZ fusion in E. coli and S. typhimurium katF mutants when spvR is expressed from an exogenous promoter .
We have previously shown that the presence of spvR induced the transcription of an spvAB ' - lacZ fusion in Salmonella and E. coli strains ( 5 ) .
To further investigate the role of katF in the transcription of the spv genes , the same experiment was performed with katF mutants .
Whilst plasmids pSTC2 and pSTC3 both encode the spvR gene , only the latter induced expression of the spvAB ' - lacZ fusion in katF mutants of E. coli and Salmonella ( Table 2 ; Fig. 5 ) .
As the spvR gene in pSTC3 is oriented in such a way that its transcription could be initiated from the cat promoter , it is likely that the expression of spvR from this promoter was responsible for the enhanced transcription of the spvAB ' - lacZ fusion in katF mutants .
In agreement with that conclusion , deletion of the spvR promoter region on pSTC3 ( plasmid pSTC17 ; Fig. 5 ) did not affect the ability of the plasmid to induce high levels of expression of the spvAB ' - lacZ fusion in the katF mutants ( Table 2 ) .
Moreover , identical spvA transcriptional starts sites were detected in the Salmonella katF and katF strains when spvR was expressed from the cat promoter of pSTC17 ( Fig. 6 ) .

Determination of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase ( CAT ) activities ( change in A412 per minute per milligram ) and analysis of specific mRNAs were performed in stationary - phase LB cultures .
For mRNA analysis , total RNAs ( 1 and 7 , ug ) were blotted onto filters and probed with PCR products specific for the spvA ( codons 7 to 238 ) , spvR ( codons 13 to 250 ) , and katF ( codons 80 to 310 ) genes from S. typhimurium .
The tet gene ( 1 - kb HindIII - NruI fragment from pACYC184 ; Table 1 ) and the vector pVK100 ( Table 1 ) were used as controls .

The S. typhimunium strains C53 and C53K were cured for the virulence plasmid pIP1350 ( Table 1 ) .
Genes carried by the recombinant plasmids are indicated .
Plasmids pSTF4 , pSTC10 , and pQF50 were used as controls .
b Values in Miller units are the averages of at least three independent experiments .
c spvR was transcribed from the cat promoter of the vector pACYC184 ; in the case of pSTC17 , the spvR promoter region was also deleted .
dependent transcription of spvR required the SpvR protein .
In the katF mutant C53K , a low but significant level of transcription of the spvR ' - lacZ fusion on pSTF12 was detected ( Table 3 ) .
This katF - independent transcription of spvR did not appear to be significantly regulated by SpvR , since expression of spvR from the cat promoter of pSTC17 enhanced by only twofold the transcription of the spvR ' - lacZ fusion in the katF strain C53K ( Table 3 ) .
Interestingly , the constitutive ( i.e. , cs - and SpvR - independent ) transcription of spvR was lower in the A C G T 1 2 3 4 pSTC2 pSTC3 transcriptional control of spvR , we examined the expression of an spvR ' - lacZ - transcriptional - fusion in the Salmonella virulence plasmid - cured strains C53 ( katF + ) and C53K ( katF ) .
Surprisingly , the spvR ' - lacZ fusion on pSTF12 ( Fig. 3 ) was poorly transcribed whatever the host strain and even displayed a slightly higher level of expression in the katF mutant than in the wild - type strain ( Table 3 ) .
Taira et al. ( 41 ) initially demonstrated that a translational spvR ' - lacZ fusion was positively regulated by the SpvR product itself .
Therefore , we hypothesized that autoregulation might play a role in the katFmediated regulation of spvR .
Consistent with that notion , plasmids pSTC2 , pSTC3 , and pSTC17 ( Fig. 5 ) induced a katF - dependent expression of the spvR ' - lacZ fusion in pSTF12 ( Table 3 ) .
In addition , the spvR - lacZ fusion on plasmid pSTF13 ( in which the promoterless lacZ gene is located immediately downstream of the TGA stop codon of spvR ; Fig. 3 ) displayed katF - dependent and growth phase - dependent transcription ( Table 3 ; Fig. 7 ) .

Virulence of S. typhimurium katF mutants in mice .
To evaluate the role of katF in Salmonella virulence , we compared the effects of a katF mutation in the wild - type strain C52 ( which contains the virulence plasmid pIP1350 ) and in the isogenic plasmid - cured strain C53 .
For that purpose , groups of five C57BL/6 mice were infected by the oral route with each of the katF strains and katF mutants .
Five days after infection , mice were sacrificed to determine the number of viable 0 to 02 100 .9 80 I , , 60 tf 0v 40 ' 0 20 9 20 o o = I ... .

Aliquots were removed at various time intervals ( between 1 and 8 h of growth ) and used to measure , B - galactosidase activity according to the method of Miller ( 23 ) .

Groups consisting of five female C57BV6 mice were orally infected with 108 bacteria .
Five days postinfection , mice were sacrificed and the number of CFU per spleen was determined .
Experiments were repeated at least three times .
Results are expressed as means of log1o values .
In all cases , the stability of the recombinant plasmid in - vivo was checked and the restriction map of plasmid DNA extracted from spleen homogenate cultures was controlled .
All mice infected with strain C52 died between 6 and 8 days postinfection ( 27 ) .
The katF mutation considerably affected the virulence of the pIP1350 - proficient strain , whereas the mutation had no detectable effect on the virulence of the attenuated plasmid - cured strain ( Table 4 ) .
In addition , the virulence level of the katF mutant C52K was identical to that of the plasmid - cured katF and katF strains ( C53 and C53K , respectively ) .
In contrast to the vector pA - CYC184 , plasmids pSTK4 and pSTK5 , which carry the Salmonella katF gene ( Fig. 1 ) , were both able to restore virulence to C52K , confirming that katF was indeed required for virulence ( Table 4 ) .
To further investigate a putative role of katF in the control of chromosomal virulence genes , besides the regulation of spv genes , we compared the kinetics of infection of strains C53 and C53K .
Although both strains displayed similar apparent growth in - vivo 5 days postinfection , the katF mutant appeared less virulent than the wild - type strain at day 11 and was more rapidly eliminated in the following days ( Table 5 ) .
As a result , the katF strain was able to persist in the spleen 3 weeks postinfection , whereas the persistence of the katF mutant was strongly affected ( Table 5 ) .
DISCUSSION Recent studies have shown that an spvRAB ' - lacZ fusion was not fully expressed in S. typhimurium and in E. coli strains mutated within the katF gene , which encodes a sigma factor involved in the selective expression of a large number of genes in stationary - phase ( 8 , 28 ) .
In this study , we elucidated the relationships between katF ( rpoS ) and the regulatory gene spvR in the growth phase - dependent regulation of the spv - ABCD operon .

176 , 1994 katF REGULATION OF SALMONELLA spv VIRULENCE GENES 6859 We have cloned the katF gene from S. typhimurium C52 .
The Salmonella katF gene was able to complement an E. coli katF mutant ( Fig. 1 ) .
A high degree of conservation of the katF gene was then confirmed at the nucleotide sequence level between the coding regions of katF in S. typhimurium , E. coli , and S. flexneri .
In addition , we have shown that katF is located downstream of the nlpD gene in S. typhimurium , as is the case in E. coli ( 14 ) .
Salmonella strains mutated in the katF gene ( C52K and C53K ) were used to study the role of katF in Salmonella virulence and in the regulation of spv genes .
Analysis of expression of spvA - specific mRNA and of an spvRAB ' - cat fusion in the wild - type C53 and mutant C53K strains confirmed the essential role played by katF in spvABCD transcription ( 8 , 28 ) .
Furthermore , a decreased transcription of spvR was observed in katF mutants of E. coli ( ZK918 ) and S. typhimunium ( C53K ) compared with transcription of wild - type strains ( Fig. 4 ) .
Complementation with the cloned katF gene demonstrated that katF controlled spvR transcription .
In contrast with this result , an spvR ' - lacZ fusion ( pSTF12 ) expressed a very low level of ,3 - galactosidase activity in katF and katF strains ( Table 3 ) .
Since it was previously shown that the spvR gene was subjected to positive autoregulation ( 11 , 41 ) , we hypothesized that the SpvR protein was required for the katF - dependent expression of the spvR ' - lacZ fusion .
Two findings corroborated this hypothesis .
( i ) Expression of spvR in trans from the cat promoter of pACYC184 ( in plasmids pSTC3 and pSTC17 ) restored katF - dependent expression of the spvR ' - lacZ fusion ( Table 3 ) .
( ii ) Expression of the transcriptional spvR - lacZ fusion in pSTF13 ( in which the lacZ gene is located immediately downstream of the spvR stop codon ) was dependent on katF ( Table 3 ) .
Therefore , it appeared that as , in conjunction with SpvR , controls the transcription of the regulatory gene spvR .
Consistent with a katF regulation of spvR , we found that spvR transcription is regulated by the growth phase ( Fig. 7 ) .
Although we could not exclude the possibility that the control of katF on spvR transcription was indirect , it is attractive to hypothesize that SpvR could be a coregulator for an RNA polymerase containing crs ( Eos ) .
Coregulators for Ecs have not yet been identified to our knowledge .
Both spvR mRNA analysis and the study of the expression of the spvR ' - lacZ fusion allowed us to detect a low but significant level of us - independent transcription of spvR ( Fig. 4 ; Table 3 ) .
This basal level of spvR transcription ( likely to be C70 dependent ) may be necessary to provide an amount of SpvR sufficient to initiate the aS - dependent transcription of spvR .
Surprisingly , the level of aS - independent expression of the spvR ' - lacZ fusion on pSTF12 was lower in the katF strain C53 than that in the katF mutant C53K ( Table 3 ) .
If one assumes that the control of as on spvR is direct , one possible explanation for this is a competition between as and C70 .
The binding of Eo5 to the spvR promoter ( s ) would be inefficient for transcription in the absence of SpvR ( i.e. , in the C53 strain containing the spvR ' - lacZ fusion ) and would further prevent the efficient binding of an RNA polymerase containing c70 ( Eu70 ) .
In that case , one would expect the transcription of the spvR ' - lacZ fusion to be more efficient in the absence of as ( i.e. , in strain C53K ) .
Clearly , in - vitro - transcription experiments with purified products are warranted to understand the exact molecular mechanisms of spvR regulation .
The promoter ( s ) and regulatory sequences involved in spvR transcription will need to be further characterized by deletion analysis , primer - extension , and gel mobility - shift assays .
Since spvR transcription is controlled by katF , would a constitutive spvR transcription be able to restore the expression of the spvABCD operon in a katF mutant ?
The induction of spvAB ' - lacZ expression observed in katF mutants of Salmonella and E. coli , when spvR is expressed in trans from an exogenous promoter ( pSTC3 and pSTC17 ; Table 2 ) , indicated that this was indeed the case .
This suggested that the reduction of spvABCD transcription in katF mutants is due mainly to decreased expression of spvR .
The two spvA mRNA startpoints detected in S. typhimurium katF spvR + strains ( Fig. 6 ) were similar to those previously identified in Salmonella dublin and Salmonella choleraesuis ( 17 , 21 ) .
Moreover , these two mRNA start sites were also used for spvA transcription in the katF strain C53K when spvR was expressed in trans from the cat promoter of pSTC17 ( Fig. 6 ) .
In that case , it is likely that both spvA promoters are recognized by Ec70 .
The lack of typical -35 elements in the spvA promoter regions might explain the requirement for the SpvR protein .
It remains to be determined whether the spvA promoters may also be recognized by EcuS , in addition to E ( u70 , when SpvR is provided .
We observed during mRNA analysis that the constitutive level of spvR transcription that was detected in the Salmonella katF mutant C53K did not significantly induce transcription of spvA and spvB ( Fig. 4 ) .
A similar observation was made with gene fusion analysis : the constitutive spvR transcription that occurred on pSTC2 and pSTF4 did not induce transcription of spvB in the katF mutant C53K ( Table 2 ) .
Interestingly , this phenomenon appears to be specific to S. typhimunium .
Indeed , although the level of spvR mRNA detected in katF strains appeared lower in E. coli than that in S. typhimurium ( Fig. 4 ) , the u ' - independent transcription of spvR on pSTC2 and pSTF4 was able to induce a low but significant level of transcription of spvB in the katF mutant of E. coli but not in that of S. typhimurium ( Table 2 ) .
One explanation for this might be the titration of SpvR in S. typhimurium by SpvRregulated promoters .
On the other hand , posttranscriptional regulation of spvR could be involved .
Gulig and Doyle showed that the effect of spv in - vivo was related to the promotion of growth rather than to the prevention of killing ( 12 ) .
The growth advantage provided by the spv genes to Salmonella strains in - vivo seems to be sufficient to convert a self - limited infection into a lethal infection .
Since katF controls the expression of the spv genes , it was not surprising to find that a katF mutation considerably affected the virulence of S. typhimurium ( Table 4 ) .
It has been previously shown that the oral 50 % lethal dose of a Salmonella mutant containing the insertion of a suicide plasmid in katF was 1,000 - fold higher than for the wild - type strain ( 8 ) .
No complementation experiments were reported .
We further confirmed the role of katF in Salmonella virulence by complementation experiments with the cloned katF gene ( Table 4 ) .
Moreover , to explore the possibility that katF may regulate chromosomal virulence genes , besides the spv genes , we compared the kinetics of infection of the plasmid - cured and derivative katF mutant Salmonella strains ( C53 and C53K , respectively ) .
Although the katF mutation had no detectable effect on the growth of strain C53 5 days postinfection , it strongly affected the persistence of the virulence plasmid - cured strain in mice 3 weeks postinfection ( Table 5 ) .
This suggests that chromosomal genes involved in Salmonella virulence may be regulated by the katF gene .
