A large number of genes showing altered expression are located in AT - rich horizontally acquired DNA sequences .
Many of these genes have also been reported to be targets for H - NS .
As Hha and YdgT interact with H - NS , our findings strongly suggest that Hha and/or YdgT must form complexes with H - NS when they silence these DNA regions .

The genomes of all members of genera belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae contain at least one copy of a gene that encodes a member of the Hha - YmoA family of proteins ( 23 , 24 ) .
These low - molecular - mass proteins show high degrees of similarity , and all of them have been identified as modulators of the expression of virulence - factors ( 7 , 30 ) .
Hha regulates , among other genes , expression of Escherichia coli - hemolysin and esp operons ( 23 , 29 , 31 , 36 ) , the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium hilA modulator of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) ( 14 , 32 ) , and virulence genes in SPI2 ( 37 ) .
The Hha paralogue YdgT contributes to modulation of virulence genes in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SPI2 ( 6 , 37 ) .
The YmoA protein regulates the expression of several Yersinia virulence - factors , as well as the RovA transcriptional activator ( 7 , 13 , 27 ) .
The Hha - YmoA proteins are encoded exclusively in the genomes of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and in conjugative plasmids isolated from these organisms ( 24 ) .
Cells in which Hha has been depleted exhibit phenotypic properties similar to those of cells lacking the nucleoid - associated protein ( NAP ) H - NS , and it has been proposed that Hha - like proteins represent a new class of NAPs ( 27 ) .
Several lines of evidence have shown that proteins belonging to the Hha family interact with members of the H - NS family to modulate gene expression ( 13 , 16 , 17 , 31 , 32 , 33 ) .
Hha - like proteins mimic the H - NS oligomerization domain ( 23 , 30 ) , and interaction of Hha with H - NS increases the repressive ability of H - NS ( 25 , 31 ) .
H - NS is the most extensively studied example of a NAP that has a role as an environmentally dependent modulator of gene expression ( 11 , 35 ) .
H - NS is considered a transcriptional repressor , playing a relevant role in silencing xenogeneic DNA ( 12 , 22 , 28 , 34 ) .
It remains to be determined whether the set of H - NS - regulated genes coincides with the set of Hha - regulated genes or whether the latter is simply a subset of the former .
A genomewide analysis of the modulatory role of Hha - like proteins has not been performed .
Here we describe a transcriptomic study of the effect of depletion of Hha - like proteins in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and provide evidence that one of the main targets for Hha and/or its paralogue YdgT are the genes in horizontally acquired DNA sequences that are silenced by H - NS .
The genome of Salmonella contains , in addition to hha , a copy of the ydgT gene , which codes for an Hha paralogue , YdgT .
When cells grow under nonstress conditions , YdgT does not significantly contribute to modulation .
Nevertheless , this protein is overexpressed in hha - mutants , which attenuates the hha phenotype ( 33 ) .
To prevent attenuation , we used a double hha ydgT mutant ( strain SV5015HY ) .
This deletion mutant , obtained by gene replacement , was constructed as described by Datsenko and Wanner ( 9 ) .
To obtain the ydgT mutant , the antibiotic resistance of plasmid pKD4 ( kanamycin ) was amplified using primers YDGTKAM1 and YDGTKAM2 .
To obtain the hha - mutant , the antibiotic resistance of plasmid pKD3 ( chloramphenicol ) was amplified using primers HHAP1 and HHAP2 .
Both constructions were verified by using primers YDGTSA and YDGTSA2 , primers HHA3 and HHA5 , and primers corresponding to pKD3 ( c1/c2 ) and pKD4 sequences ( k1/k2 ) ( primer sequences are described in Table S1 in the supplemental material ) .
Strain SV5015HY ( hha ydgT ) was obtained by P22 HT transduction of the hha deletion into the ydgT strain ( Table 1 ) .
Transcriptomic analyses were performed by using a Salmonella microarray that contained 6,119 probes corresponding to 5,116 open reading frames , 21 rRNAs , 86 tRNAs , 51 small RNAs , and 845 intergenic regions .
The methods used for RNA extraction , retrotranscription , labeling , hybridization , microarray scanning , and data analysis will be described elsewhere ( J. F. Mariscotti and F. García del Portillo , submitted for publication ) .
Compared to the wild - type ( wt ) strain , strain SV5015HY showed altered expression of about 1,000 genes .
The mRNA levels of 471 genes were 2 - fold higher in the hha ydgT mutant , indicating that Hha and YdgT repress gene expression in the wt strain .
The mRNA levels of 504 genes were 2 - fold lower in the mutant strain , indicating 1152 VOL .

that Hha and YdgT activate gene expression in the wt strain ( see Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material ) .
Upregulation predominated in genes belonging to several functional categories , including genomic islands ( SPI1 to SPI5 and other genes related to horizontally acquired DNA regions ) , and the pSLT plasmid .
In contrast , down - regulation predominated in genes belonging to the surface structure , cell motilitysecretion , and translation functional categories ( Fig. 1 ) .
Most of the genes in SPI1 to SPI5 ( 93.22 % of the genes ) were predominantly overexpressed in strain SV5015HY ( Table 2 ) .
To confirm the transcriptomic results obtained , we used reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR to analyze the mRNA levels of some of the genes that were differentially expressed .
Readyto - Go RT - PCR beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) and primer pairs shown in Table S1 in the supplemental material were used .
The genes selected were prgH ( which encodes a component of the needle complex of the type III secretion apparatus of SPI1 ) , hilC and invF ( which encode invasion regulatory proteins of SPI1 ) , sseB ( which encodes a component of the translocation machinery of SPI2 ) , and ssrA/ssrB ( which encodes a two - component regulatory system of SPI2 ) .
RT - PCR analysis confirmed overexpression of all these genes in strain SV5015HY ( Fig. 2 ) .
To examine the effect of deregulation of virulence genes in the SPIs , we used the competitive index ( 2 ) .
Equivalent numbers of cells from strains SV5015 and SV5015HY were combined and used to inoculate an animal host ( BALB/c mice ) ( input ) .
Bacteria were recovered after 48 h from the spleen and liver ( output ) , and the competitive index was determined .
The competitive indexes were 0.08 0.05 and 0.05 0.03 in spleen and liver homogenates , respectively .
As previously reported for S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain SL1344 ( 6 , 37 ) , the hha and ydgT alleles are responsible for an attenuated virulence phenotype .
Several ( 42.52 % ) of the putative open reading frames in the virulence plasmid pSLT exhibited altered expression in strain SV5015HY .
Most of them ( 97 % ) , including those in the tra operon , were overexpressed ( Table 2 ) .

effect of the hha and ydgT mutations on conjugation of plasmid pSLT , mating experiments were performed using a conjugation - derepressed derivative of plasmid pSLT , finO : : Km ( 4 ) .
The antibiotic resistance cassettes associated with hha ( chloramphenicol ) and ydgT ( kanamycin ) mutations in strain SV5015HY were first deleted .
To do this , we used FLP recombinase of plasmid pCP20 ( 9 ) and obtained strain SV5015HY - 2 .
P22 HT transduction was used to transfer the finO : : Km allele from plasmid pSLT of SV4478 into SV5015 and SV5015HY - 2 , generating strains SV5015 - finO and SV5015HY - 2-finO , respectively .
The recipient used in the mating experiments was strain SV3081 , a pSLT - cured strain , which was transformed with plasmid pLG338 - 30 to confer ampicillin resistance for selection of transconjugants .
The frequency of plasmid transfer was calculated per donor bacterium .
The frequency of pSLT FinO plasmid transfer was 10 - fold higher when strain SV5015HY - 2 was used as the donor than when the wt strain was used as the donor ( 1.75 10 4 and 1.84 10 5 , respectively ) .
These results show that the Hha - YdgT proteins participate in the regulation of plasmid pSLT conjugation .
RT - PCR analysis of transcription of the prgH , hilC , invF , sseB , ssrA , and ssrB genes from strains SV5015 ( wt ) and SV5015HY ( hha ydgT ) .
16S rRNA was used as a control to confirm that equivalent quantities of templates were loaded .
ticipation of Hha - like proteins in the modulation of conjugative plasmid transfer has also been reported previously for the IncH1 plasmid R27 ( 15 ) .
These results show that Hha - like proteins negatively modulate the expression of horizontally acquired genes in enteric bacteria , either directly or indirectly .
This observation coincides with data for target genes previously described for Hhalike proteins ( 23 ) .
Hha - YdgT may negatively modulate gene expression either directly or indirectly .
A good example of this is the virulence genes of SPI1 ; Hha modulates the master regulator , the hilA gene ( 14 , 20 ) .
Genes showing reduced expression in strain SV5015HY belong to several functional categories .
The decreased expression of many of these genes may be due to an indirect effect of the double mutation on cell physiology ( most likely the genes in the translation , ribosome structure , and biogenesis functional categories ) or on specific transcriptional repressors .
Remarkably , one significant set of genes showing reduced expression includes many genes involved in flagellar biogenesis ( Table 2 ) .
We also used RT - PCR to confirm deregulation of flgB , which encodes a flagellar basal body rod protein ( Fig. 2 ) .
We also compared strains SV5015 and SV5015HY in motility agar plates ( 18 ) .
Strain SV5015HY formed a very small halo ( Fig. 3 ) .
This phenotype was complemented by expressing a plasmid that contains hha ( pUBM22 ) .
Neither hha nor ydgT single mutants exhibited the drastic effect on motility shown by the hha ydgT double mutant ( data not shown ) .
Hence , the lower expression of several flagellar genes in strain SV5015HY resulted in reduced motility .
The doubling time in LB - medium of SV5015HY was 40 % lower than that of the wt strain .
The decrease in the growth - rate may be explained by the downregulation of the genes involved in translation , ribosomes , and biogenesis , as shown in the transcriptomic analysis ( Fig. 1 ) .
Nevertheless , the difference in the doubling times of the strains FIG. 3 .
Growth of strains SV5015 ( wt ) ( colony A ) , SV5015HY ( hha ydgT ) ( colony B ) , and SV5015HY ( pUBM22 ) ( colony C ) on a motility agar plate .
analyzed is not sufficient to explain the difference in the reduced halos formed in motility plates .
Hha - like proteins form nucleoprotein complexes with H - NS ( 13 , 15 , 23 , 30 , 33 ) .
Recent results presented independently by different groups have shown that this NAP silences the expression of horizontally acquired DNA under nonpermissive conditions ( 22 , 28 , 34 ) .
Hence , a significant set of genes that are silenced by H - NS should also be silenced by Hha - YdgT .
To confirm this , we compared the reported H - NS binding sites in the Salmonella genome ( 28 ) and our transcriptomic data .
The results ( Table 2 ) clearly support the hypothesis that Hha and YdgT interact with H - NS to favor silencing of xenogeneic DNA .
Although these results were obtained with two different Salmonella strains ( SV5015 and 14028 ) and the experimental approaches differed , 87 % of SPI genes were repressed by Hha - YdgT and are reported to contain binding sites for H - NS .
The coincidence is also high for other SV5015HY up - regulated genes on other genomic islands ( 34 % ) and for the pSLT plasmid ( 46 % ) .
It has been suggested that H - NS is not an effective silencer at all binding sites for some horizontally transferred sequences ( 28 ) .
This suggestion is supported by our finding that Hha - like proteins also participate in silencing xenogeneic DNA .
Coregulation of genes in SPIs by H - NS and Hha - YdgT can be also inferred from two recent independent reports .
The Hha and YdgT proteins repress expression of SPI2 virulence genes ( 37 ) .
Furthermore , H - NS down - regulates SPI2 expression , in competition with the two - component activator system SsrA - SsrB ( 40 ) .
The results reported here show that the Hha and YdgT proteins also repress ssrA and ssrB expression , thereby supporting the hypothesis that the Hha/H - NS complex modulates SPI2 gene expression .
For many other functional categories , the coincidence between Hha - regulated genes and H - NS - regulated genes was low .
This finding can probably be attributed to H - NS modulating housekeeping functions in the absence of Hha - YdgT or to indirect effects of the double hha ydgT mutation on cell physiology .
Some well - characterized examples of H - NS - modulated operons are bgl and proU ( 10 , 21 ) .
We have been unable 1156 NOTES J. BACTERIOL .
to show that Hha - YdgT modulates these operons ( unpublished results ) .
We therefore suggest that the regulatory regions of the H - NS target genes include two categories : genes for which H - NS requires the formation of heteromeric complexes with Hha - like proteins in order to achieve efficient repression and genes repressed by H - NS homooligomers .
Many of the H - NSmodulated genes that are located in horizontally acquired DNA , among others , belong to the first category .
The mechanism by which H - NS activates gene expression is not well characterized .
This is also the case for Hha - YdgT .
Nevertheless , we also found coincidences between genes down - regulated in strain SV5015HY and genes down - regulated in hns mutants .
Genes related to flagellar biogenesis are positively regulated by H - NS in E. coli or Salmonella ( 1 , 28 ) .
Our transcriptomic analysis showed that the Hha and YdgT proteins also positively regulate flagellar genes .
Again , these findings point to participation of Hha - like proteins in some of the cellular processes that require H - NS .
