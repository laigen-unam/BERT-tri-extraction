Indicator plates containing nutrient agar ( Difco ) , 1 g of NaCl per liter , 0.2 % glycerol , 0.2 % rhamnose , and 50 mg of 2,3,5 - triphenyltetrazolium chloride per liter were used in the detection of adenylate cyclase ( cya ) and CRP ( crp ) mutants ( 36 ) .	 CRP 	 crp 	regulator
Effect of the cAMP - CRP complex on the expression of ilvB .	 CRP 	 ilvB 	activator
The addition of cAMP restored the level of AHAS I activity in cya strain DU8811 but had no effect on crp derivative DU8812 , indicating that cAMP was acting through CRP .	 CRP 	 crp 	no_relation
) These results suggested that haploid levels of CRP did not allow maximal expression of ilvB in S. typhimurium .	 CRP 	 ilvB 	activator
In an attempt to determine the concentration of CRP needed to allow maximal ilvB expression , we constructed a pBR322 derivative , pDU111 , that contained both ilvB and crp ( Fig. 3 ) .	 CRP 	 crp 	activator

Following adaptation to NCE glucose medium ( pH 4.4 ) for 1 h , the - galactosidase activity of the cadC mutant ( YK5003 ) was approximately 1.6 - fold higher than that of the wild - type ( JF4484 ) , indicating that ompR is transcriptionally downregulated by CadC ( Fig. 5B ) .

Assays of - galactosidase in strains with rpoS - lac fusions , Western blot ( immunoblot ) analysis , and pulse - labeling and immunoprecipitation of both fusion proteins and native RpoS show that an S. typhimurium hfq mutant has a four - to sevenfold reduction in expression of rpoS that is attributable primarily to a defect in translation .

The rpoS gene encodes a specificity factor for RNA polymerase ( RpoS [ also called 38 or S ] ) ( 46 , 50 , 62 ) that is required for the transcription of many genes expressed during the onset of stationary - phase ( 40 ) .	 RpoS 	 rpoS 	regulator
An hns mutant , lacking the abundant DNA - binding protein H - NS , has increased RpoS levels in exponential phase through effects on both translation and protein stability ( 4 , 66 ) ; RpoS stability was recently shown to be controlled by the ClpXP protease ( 55 ) .	 RpoS 	 hns 	activator

This result suggested that the hfq mutant might have lower levels of catalase HPII ( katE ) , whose induction during stationary phase requires RpoS ( 8 , 41 ) .	 RpoS 	 katE 	activator
Because the activity of the RpoS sigma factor is variable even among wildtype isolates of E. coli K - 12 ( 40 ) and S. typhimurium LT2 ( 60 ) , we tested katE - lac expression in two additional S. typhimurium strains : the mouse - virulent strain ATCC 14028s and strain DB7000 ( genotype given in Table 1 ) .	 RpoS 	 katE 	activator
We investigated the strain dependence of RpoS activity , as measured with the katE - lac reporter , by using a transposon insertion linked to rpoS to exchange this region between LT2 and the virulent strain ATCC 14028s in phage P22 - mediated transductional crosses ( see Materials and Methods for details ) .

Analysis of the resulting recombinant strains shows that there is a genetic difference in the rpoS region , likely reflecting differences in rpoS gene structure or regulatory elements , that determines the different levels of RpoS activity and katE - lac expression in LT2 and ATCC 14028s .

Multiple mechanisms that regulate RpoS expression and stability are already known from studies with E. coli ( see the introduction ) and S. typhimurium ( 60 ) ; we have not yet determined the genetic factors other than rpoS that are responsible for the differences between LT2 and ATCC 14028s .

Significantly , we found that the hfq mutation reduced katE - lac expression in TE6227 by the same factor as for the strains shown in Fig. 2 ( 7 ) ; it was also found to reduce synthesis of RpoS ( see below ) .	 RpoS 	 katE 	activator
Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the effect of hfq on katE expression is a consequence of reduced levels of RpoS ( see below ) .	 RpoS 	 katE 	repressor
To investigate whether reduced expression of the katE - lac reporter in the hfq mutant can be ascribed to lower levels of the RpoS sigma factor , we used a monoclonal antibody ( 1RS1 [ 50 ] ) , reactive with E. coli RpoS , to probe Western blots of total cell proteins ( Fig. 5 ) .

Quantitation of hfq effect on rpoS - lac protein and operon fusions Genotype of labeled strain Radioactivity in LacZ or RpoS - LacZ a ( avg ) Ratio of radioactivity ( hfq/hfq ) rpoS - lac [ pr ] hfq : : Mud - Cam 127 , 147 ( 137 ) 0.13 rpoS - lac [ pr ] hfq 1,070 , 1,012 ( 1,041 ) rpoS - lac [ op ] hfq : : Mud - Cam 5,560 , 4,710 ( 5,140 ) 0.4 rpoS - lac [ op ] hfq 11,730 , 13,960 ( 12,850 ) a Arbitrary units determined by use of the PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) .

In this work , we measured the rate of synthesis of RpoS during exponential - growth in minimal glucose medium , a condition permitting only very low - level expression of rpoS , and found that synthesis was reduced in the hfq mutant by four - to fivefold .	 RpoS 	 rpoS 	repressor
Assays of - galactosidase expression from a katE - lac fusion suggested a deficit of about sixfold in RpoS activity caused by the hfq mutation in the same strain background and under the same growth - conditions .	 RpoS 	 katE 	activator
These reductions are similar to , and even slightly more pronounced than , the decrease in RpoS activity reported by katE - lac at stationary phase in LB - medium .	 RpoS 	 katE 	activator
Finally , we constructed an S. typhimurium strain ( TE6227 ) with high - level expression of RpoS due to a favorable combination of background ( LT2 ) and rpoS allele ( from ATCC 14028s ) .	 RpoS 	 rpoS 	repressor
This might also explain why we were unable to transfer the rpoS allele of ATCC 14028s into the DB7000 background ( 7 ) , since this combination would be predicted to yield still higher levels of RpoS .	 RpoS 	 rpoS 	repressor
In addition , the srfABC operon previously isolated as an SsrB - regulated operon clustered with the flagellar class 2 operon and was determined to be under FlhDC control .	 FlhDC 	 srfABC 	regulator
In addition , the srfABC operon previously isolated as an SsrB - regulated operon clustered with the flagellar class 2 operon and was determined to be under FlhDC control .	 SsrB 	 srfABC 	regulator
We show below that the srfABC operon is under FlhDC control but not 28 control , indicating that this operon is a flagellar class 2 operon .	 FlhDC 	 srfABC 	regulator

The srfABC operon that clustered with flagellar class 2 genes ranked highest of all the virulence - associated genes on the FlhDC - dependent list , which was consistent with its clustering with flagellar genes .	 FlhDC 	 srfABC 	regulator
Transcription was 30 - fold reduced in the absence of FlhDC but was not significantly affected by the fliA null allele ( Table 3 ) .	 FlhDC 	 fliA 	repressor
While we did not obtain a MudJ insertion in STM3138 , we presumed that its clustering with the flagellar class 3 genes , its dependence of FlhDC for expression ( RNA levels were 67 - fold lower in flhDC compared to LT2 [ Table 2 ] ) , its amino - acid homology to MCP proteins , and the presence of a 28 consensus promoter sequence upstream ( the consensus 10 sequence is 80 bases upstream of the ATG start codon ) was sufficient evidence to include it with the new Salmonella flagellar class 3 genes .

However , a polar , null allele in srfB was also unaffected in motility , even though it was verified to be dependent on an FlhDC - dependent class 2 promoter for its expression .	 FlhDC 	 srfB 	activator

Since the comparison of the effects of this exogenously added intermediate on metE gene activation is confounded by the unequal MetJ repression in an auxotroph versus a prototroph , we inactivated the metJ - encoded repressor in these strains .	 MetJ 	 metE 	activator
To test whether homocysteine plays a similar role in the activation of metH gene expression by MetR , a Xgt2 phage carrying a S. typhimurium metH - lacZ fusion ( XHlac ) ( 18 ) was used to lysogenize strains GS719 , GS722 , and GS747 .	 MetR 	 metH 	activator

It is not clear from these experiments whether the MetR protein activates metE - lacZ expression in the absence of homocysteine and homocysteine modulates this basal activation over only a four - to fivefold range or whether the endogenous pool of homocys - 3280 URBANOWSKI AND STAUFFER G 2 3 4 I .

As we considered it likely that the strong effect of CsrA on the mRNA levels of STM3611 was mediated , at least partly , by the indirect regulation of STM3611 through FlhDC and FliA , we attempted to complement the csrA mutation with plasmid - borne expression of fliA and flhDC , respectively .

We explain this result with the fact that the csrA mutant is deficient in the expression of the anti - sigma factor flgM , which is co - transcribed with fliA and counteracts FliA 's activity in the wild type background ( Chevance and Hughes , 2008 ) .	 FliA 	 flgM 	no_relation

Overexpression of fliA did not restore the swimming ability in the csrA mutant , which is in agreement with the model that the other FlhDC regulated class II genes , which assemble the hook - basal body of flagella ( Chevance and Hughes , 2008 ) , are shut down in the csrA mutant .

Specifically , a mutant in STM3611 shows a more pronounced rdar phenotype on CR plates than the wild type and the protein level of CsgD , the major activator of curli and cellulose synthesis , is upregulated ( Simm et al. , 2007 ) .	 CsgD 	 STM3611 	activator

The same phenotype was also observed in a STM1344 fliA double mutant , confirming our model that STM1344 acts upstream of FliA and thereby regulates the PDE STM3611 , which in turn positively controls motility behaviour and has a negative impact on the production of biofilm matrix components .

Notably , the regulation of STM3611 by CsrA occurred at multiple levels : by two indirect pathways involving FlhDC ( Fig. 3 ) and STM1344 ( Fig. 5 ) , respectively , and by a direct , presumably post - transcriptional mechanism ( Figs. 2 and 4 ) .	 FlhDC 	 STM3611 	regulator
Signal integration into the Csr/c - di - GMP system CsrA activity is also controlled by the BarA - SirA ( BarA - UvrY in E. coli ) two - component system ( Fig. 6 ) , which activates the transcription of csrB and csrC ( Altier et al. , 2000b ; Suzuki et al. , 2002 ; Teplitski et al. , 2003 ; Weilbacher et al. , 2003 ) .

In E. coli ( Gudapaty et al. , 2001 ) and in S.

One such regulator , NsrR , has recently been shown to be responsible for repression of hmp transcription in the absence of NO in Escherichia coli and Salmonella , but the roles of other members of this regulon in Salmonella , particularly in surviving nitrosative stresses in - vitro and in - vivo , have not been elucidated .

t002 Results The Rcs Signaling by rcsB Overexpression Requires the Presence of RcsC or RcsD In a previous study , we have demonstrated that when the threshold concentration of RcsB regulator has been reached the transcription of rcsD is suppressed , leading to a negative autoregulation mechanism of the Rcs system in S. Typhimurium [ 17 ] .	 RcsB 	 rcsB 	no_relation
For this purpose , we analyzed the expression levels of the well characterized RcsB - dependent cps operon in the absence of rcsC or rcsD genes and in the rcsC rcsD double mutant , overexpressing rcsB from prcsB plasmid .	 RcsB 	 rcsB 	no_relation
To determine whether the RcsC and RcsD contribute to the modulation of other Rcsdependent genes , we investigated the expression of flhDC : : MudJ transcriptional - fusion , an RcsB - repressed operon [ 11 ] .	 RcsB 	 flhDC 	repressor
Effect of Acetyl - phosphate on the Rcs Phosphorelay Pathway Since , the capsular and flagellar genes expression are affected by the acetyl - phosphate accumulation produced in the ackA mutant mediated by RcsB in the absence of RcsC [ 16 ] , we decided to study the effect of acetyl - phosphate in the Rcs system when RcsB is overexpressed .

Moreover , we found that RcsB overproduction resulted in lower levels of cps expression in the ackA rcsC mutant compared with the wild - type levels , while in the the ackA rcsD rcsC mutant no cps transcription was observed ( Fig. 2 ) .	 RcsB 	 ackA 	no_relation

Furthermore , these data also suggest that in this condition RcsC is more efficient than RcsD in the transfer of the phosphate group directly to RcsB , because the highest cps expression was observed when only the RcsC sensor was maintained ( Fig. 2 , see ackA rcsD mutant ) .	 RcsB 	 ackA 	no_relation
We observed that RcsB is a self - interacting protein , since the b - galactosidase values produced in strains with plasmids containing rcsB fused to the T18 or T25 fragments were 12 to 25 fold higher than the negative control .	 RcsB 	 rcsB 	regulator
Supporting this hypothesis , we demonstrated that the expression of both cps and flhDC operons were modulated under high RcsB levels in an rcsC or rcsD mutant .	 RcsB 	 flhDC 	activator
We observed similar expression patterns when the cps or flhDC expressions were induced by RcsB overproduction and acetyl phosphate accumulation , but in this last condition the levels were higher than when only rcsB was overexpressed ( Fig. 1 and 2 ) .	 RcsB 	 flhDC 	activator

To distinguish between these possibilities , we analyzed the sequence recognized by PhoP in the orgBC promoter region by DNase I footprinting ( Fig. 5B ) .	 PhoP 	 orgBC 	regulator

The cysK and cysP promoters contain additional binding sites , and we have proposed that CysB bends these promoters by binding to adjacent sites .	 CysB 	 cysK 	regulator
CysB was found to bind as a tetramer , and N - acetyl - L-serine increased the electrophoretic mobilities of one - protein complexes of the multibinding site cysK and cysP promoters without changing their stoichiometry , indicating that a single CysB tetramer can bend these promoters and that N - acetyl - L-serine diminishes such bending .	 CysB 	 cysK 	no_relation
A deletion analysis has shown that CBS - K1 is required for CysB - dependent transcription initiation at the cysK promoter ( 39 ) , and CBS - J and CBS - P1 are thought to serve the same role in their promoters because of similarities in sequence and relative position .	 CysB 	 cysK 	activator
The cysK promoter contains a second CysB - binding site , CBS - K2 , which is upstream of and contiguous with CBS - K1 ( 39 ) , and the cysP promoter contains two additional sites ( Fig. 1 ) : CBS - P2 , which is downstream of CBS - P1 and separated from it by about 21 bp ; and CBS - P3 , which lies between and overlaps portions of CBS - P1 and CBS - P2 ( 24 ) .	 CysB 	 cysK 	regulator
These extra sites are believed to be responsible for the fact that N - acetyl - L - serine increases the electrophoretic mobility of complexes between CysB and the cysK and cysP promoters but has no such effect with the cysJIH promoter or with the individual sites CBS - K1 , CBS - K2 , CBS - P1 , or CBS - P2 ( 24 , 39 , 44 ) .	 CysB 	 cysJIH 	regulator

CysB 	 cysK 	regulator
We have proposed that this phenomenon is caused by the ability of CysB to bind to adjacent sites in the cysK and cysP promoters and bend DNA , which is known to cause anomalously slow electrophoretic mobility ( 63 ) .	 CysB 	 cysK 	regulator
In view of the important role attributed to DNA bending in promoter activation ( 46 , 59 ) , we thought it important to document the existence and extent of CysB - induced bending in the cysK and cysP promoters , particularly since similar behavior has been reported for two other LysR family proteins , OccR ( 61 ) and NodD ( 12 ) .

Owing to a negative charge , which causes it to migrate away from complexes , N - acetyl - L-serine does not affect the electrophoretic migration of complexes between CysB and the cysK and cysP promoters , unless it is included in the electrophoresis buffer ( 24 , 39 ) .	 CysB 	 cysK 	regulator

The same reasoning can be applied to the cysK and cysP promoters , whose transcription activation is also maximal at CysB concentrations that give only one - protein complexes .	 CysB 	 cysK 	activator
Our gel shift studies with circularly permuted DNA fragments confirm this conclusion and suggest that a single CysB tetramer bends the cysK and cysP promoters by approximately 1000 and that N - acetyl - L-serine decreases this angle to about 500 .	 CysB 	 cysK 	regulator
Our interpretation of these data is summarized in Fig. 4 , which shows a single CysB tetramer binding simultaneously to both CBS - K1 and CBS - K2 in the cysK promoter and bending the DNA at or near the junction between the two binding sites .	 CysB 	 cysK 	regulator
In the cysK promoter , the bending that results from binding of a single CysB tetramer to CBS - K1 and CBS - K2 simultaneously can be considered a kind of DNA looping ( 55 ) , albeit with a very small loop of only the few base pairs that separate these sites .	 CysB 	 cysK 	regulator

In the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine , a single CysB tetramer binds to both the CBS - K1 and CBS - K2 sites of the cysK promoter or to CBS - P3 in the cysP promoter .	 CysB 	 cysK 	regulator
In the case of CysB , the significance of induced DNA bending in transcription activation is not clear , since bend points lie outside of the -60 to -40 region , i.e. , at position -80 or -70 in the cysK promoter and at -29 or -24 in the cysP promoter .	 CysB 	 cysK 	activator
We currently favor the notion that the 1000 bending of the cysK and cysP promoters functions to increase contacts between CysB and promoters , with a resultant increase in binding affinity that helps to sequester CysB at its promoters , particularly when sulfur is replete and N - acetyl - L-serine levels are low .

Thus , the higher affinities of CysB for the cysK and cysP promoters may be related more to the presence of secondary binding sites than to differences in affinities between the transcription activator sites CBS - P1 , CBS - K1 , and CBS - J .	 CysB 	 cysK 	activator

Therefore , we had isolated a lac gene fusion to the phoPQ locus whose activity was modulated by PhoP ( strain EG9252 in Table 2 ) .	 PhoP 	 phoPQ 	activator
Mutants EG5170 and EG5172 were transformed with the phoP - containing plasmid pEG9014 , and - galactosidase activity was determined in extracts prepared from cells grown under both inducing and noninducing conditions for lacp - controlled PhoP ( 0.7 and 0 mM IPTG , respectively ) .	 PhoP 	 phoP 	repressor
In contrast to the results obtained with EG9252 , no differences in - galactosidase activity could be detected for derivatives of EG5170 and EG5172 harboring the phoP plasmid upon induction for PhoP expression ( Table 2 ) .	 PhoP 	 phoP 	activator
A promoter within Tn10 ( 24 ) could provide a low level of phoQ transcription sufficient to mediate phosphorylation of PhoP , which could then activate transcription at the phoPQ promoter .	 PhoP 	 phoPQ 	activator

Induction of phoPQ resulted in an increase in - galactosidase activity in EG9252 , EG5170 , EG9266 , and EG9315 ( Table 2 ) , confirming that both PhoP and PhoQ are necessary for autoregulation of the phoPQ operon .	 PhoP 	 phoPQ 	no_relation

As expected , no PhoP could be found in EG9316 ( an EG5172 derivative with phoP : : Tn10 ) or in other strains with insertions in phoP ( EG9252 , EG5170 , EG9266 , and EG9315 ) .	 PhoP 	 phoP 	repressor

DISCUSSION We investigated the regulation of the phoPQ operon of S. typhimurium , which encodes the transcriptional regulator PhoP and the putative kinase - phosphatase PhoQ .	 PhoP 	 phoPQ 	regulator
We established that phoPQ is transcribed from two promoters , one of which is positively autoregulated by both PhoP and PhoQ .	 PhoP 	 phoPQ 	activator
These properties include the presence of two appropriately located transposons : a Tn10 in the 3 end of phoP that provided a promoter for low levels of PhoQ expression ( 24 ) and a MudJ downstream of the PhoP - dependent promoter phoPp 1 but upstream of the start site for phoPp 2 , a promoter that is still expressed in the absence of PhoP and PhoQ .	 PhoP 	 phoP 	no_relation

PhoP 	 phoP 	no_relation
Transcription originating from Tn10 was low ( compare 15 to 20 U of - galactosidase in EG9316 with 110 to 130 U coming from the phoPQ promoter in EG5172 ) , but sufficient PhoQ was produced to appropriately modulate PhoP .	 PhoP 	 phoPQ 	no_relation
This results in the production of phospho - PhoP , which can activate transcription from phoPp 1 ( p phoP - 1 ) and to a lower extent from phoPp 2 .	 PhoP 	 phoP 	activator
Then , our results are consistent with a model that predicts the phosphorylated form of PhoP to be the actual transcriptional activator of phoPQ .	 PhoP 	 phoPQ 	activator
The unphosphorylated form of PhoP is unlikely to compete with phospho - PhoP for a PhoP - binding site ( s ) in the phoPQ promoter because the transcription levels remained unchanged upon induction of PhoP expression in a phoQ mutant carrying a phoP plasmid .	 PhoP 	 phoP 	no_relation

Small amounts of PhoQ were sufficient to induce the PhoP - dependent expression of phoPQ .	 PhoP 	 phoPQ 	activator
However , overexpression of PhoQ without a concomitant increase of PhoP resulted in levels of phoPQ transcription observed in a phoQ mutant ( Table 2 and Fig. 4A ) .	 PhoP 	 phoPQ 	no_relation
The levels of - galactosidase in a phoQ mutant harboring the phoPQ plasmid ( EG5172/pEG9071 ) remained high upon induction of phoPQ , perhaps reflecting the fact that both PhoP and PhoQ are being overexpressed from this plasmid .	 PhoP 	 phoPQ 	no_relation

In addition , B12 - mediated repression of the metE - lacZ fusion is dependent on a functional MetR protein .	 MetR 	 metE 	repressor
The results indicate that B12 - mediated repression of the metE gene is primarily a loss of MetR - mediated activation due to depletion of the coactivator homocysteine , rather than a direct repression by the MetH - Bl2 holoenzyme .	 MetR 	 metE 	repressor
Here we provide evidence that a large part of the B12 - mediated repression of the metE gene is a result of reduced MetR - homocysteine activation .	 MetR 	 metE 	repressor
The MetH - B12 holoenzyme , along with the metF and metJ gene products , probably plays an indirect role in B12 - mediated repression by changing the intracellular levels of both the MetR activator protein and its coactivator homocysteine .	 MetR 	 metF 	repressor
However , at that time the role of MetR - homocysteine - mediated activation of the metE gene was unknown .	 MetR 	 metE 	activator

For instance , the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium CpxA sensor was shown to indirectly activate hilA , an AraC - like transcription factor regulating SPI - 1 , at the transcriptional level in a CpxR response regulator - independent manner ( 32 ) .	 CpxR 	 hilA 	activator
Subsequent experiments using preAB double mutants and ectopic expression of preA led us to formulate a different model whereby PreA acts as an activator of pmrCAB , likely in an indirect fashion .	 PreA 	 pmrCAB 	activator
Because the only two known activators of pmrCAB are PmrA , by autoregulation ( 14 , 36 ) , and PhoP , via the PmrD small protein ( 23 ) , we tested both regulatory systems for their genetic interactions with the preB mutation .	 PhoP 	 pmrCAB 	activator

This was not the case , because of several genes tested , only pmrCAB and yibD , an open reading frame of unknown function regulated by PmrA ( 41 ) , were upregulated in a preB background , and the polymyxin resistance phenotype was not altered compared to that of the wild type .

Levels of rpoS mRNA were slightly increased , yet RpoS protein levels were strongly decreased .	 RpoS 	 rpoS 	repressor

We note , however , that the previously reported non - motile phenotype of Dhfq on swim agar plates [ 32 ] was not rescued by flhDC overexpression ( data not shown ) , presumably because the FlhD 2 C 2 - independent chemotaxis genes required for full motility are also down - regulated in the absence of Hfq ( Table 1 ) .

DISCUSSION Previous data from our lab suggested that RtsA induces expression of hilA , thereby inducing expression of the entire SPI1 TTSS ( 26 ) .	 RtsA 	 hilA 	activator
Here we present evidence that RtsA also coordinates expression of the SPI1 TTSS and dsbA , which encodes a periplasmic disulfide bond isomerase .	 RtsA 	 dsbA 	regulator
While we have not definitively proven that RtsA directly induces expression of dsbA in serovar Typhimurium , our data suggest that this is the case .	 RtsA 	 dsbA 	activator
Thus , if RtsA controls expression of serovar Typhimurium dsbA indirectly via another regulator , this regulator is present in E. coli but does not perform the same function , control of dsbA expression .	 RtsA 	 dsbA 	regulator

DISCUSSION In this study , we performed a genome - wide search for a regulator of multidrug resistance in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium by random shotgun cloning and discovered BaeR , which upregulates the mdtABCD locus and acrD , thereby increasing resistance to - lactams , novobiocin , and deoxycholate .	 BaeR 	 acrD 	regulator
In the present study , we found that overexpression of BaeR strongly stimulates the expression of mdtABCD and acrD in Salmonella .	 BaeR 	 acrD 	activator
Sequences resembling the BaeR box were found in the region upstream of the mdt - bae operon and acrD ( Fig. 2A ) , and an electrophoretic - mobility - shift assay showed that the BaeR protein binds to these regions ( Fig. 2B ) .	 BaeR 	 acrD 	no_relation

To start , we first screened four alternative sigma factor mutants of S.

Preincubation with 0.5 jig of CysB protein per ml caused approximately 50 % o of the cysK promoter fragment to migrate as a band with a mobility of 0.52 relative to that of uncomplexed DNA ( Fig. 3 , lanes 1 and 2 ) .	 CysB 	 cysK 	activator

A 496 - bp 5 ' - labeled EcoRI - NarI fragment , containing the cysK promoter region from positions -307 to + 170 relative to the major transcription start site , was preincubated at 1 tug/ml with a subsaturating concentration ( 0.5 pLg/ml ) of CysB protein and various amounts of O - acetyl - L-serine for 4 min at 370C .	 CysB 	 cysK 	activator
We reasoned that rapid anodal migration of the negatively charged N - acetyl - L-serine away from the CysB protein - cysK promoter complex during electrophoresis might eliminate any effects on binding , whereas O - acetyl - L-serine would not be so affected because it has no net charge at a neutral pH. Indeed , unbound O - acetyl - L-serine would probably remain at the origin and slowly isomerize to N - acetyl - L - serine ( 6 ) , thereby providing a steady flow of N - acetyl - Lserine toward migrating complexes .

These results suggest that although free acetyl - L - serine is not necessary to maintain increased stability once the cysJIH promoter - CysB protein complex enters the gel , it is required to stabilize the fast complex of the cysK promoter and CysB protein during electrophoresis .

Although class 2 operon expression is inhibited in - vivo by the fliZ mutation ( 23 ) , transcription from the class 2 promoter occurs efficiently in - vitro in the absence of FliZ ( 13 , 31 ) .	 FliZ 	 fliZ 	repressor
On the basis of the observation that the fliZ mutation decreased the amount of FlhC without having a significant effect on the transcription and translation of the flhC gene , Saini et al. ( 37 ) proposed that FliZ is a posttranslational activator of FlhD 4 C 2 .	 FlhD 	 flhC 	no_relation

For example , the fliZ mutation decreases the transcriptional expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) genes ( 14 ) through affecting the activity of their positive regulator , HilD ( 5 , 17 ) .	 HilD 	 fliZ 	activator
On the other hand , the fliZ mutation increases type 1 fimbrial gene expression through affecting posttranscriptionally the activity of the positive regulator FimZ ( 6 , 39 ) .	 FimZ 	 fliZ 	activator
Recently , we found that a nonflagellar gene , ydiV , encodes another anti - FlhD 4 C 2 factor ( 41 ) .	 FlhD 	 ydiV 	activator
In this study , we showed that FliZ - dependent activation of class 2 operon expression was more profound in poor medium than in rich - medium and not observed in the ydiV mutant background .	 FliZ 	 ydiV 	activator
This suggested the possibility that FliZ control of class 2 operon expression is exerted via the regulatory pathway of ydiV expression .	 FliZ 	 ydiV 	regulator
Gel mobility - shift assay and in - vivo and in vitro transcription analyses revealed that FliZ binds to the promoter region of the nlpC - ydiV operon and acts as a repressor of its transcription .	 FliZ 	 ydiV 	repressor
Therefore , FliZ - dependent activation of class 2 operon expression is achieved by repression of the ydiV gene by FliZ .	 FliZ 	 ydiV 	repressor

Sequestration of the GATC pairs is dependent on the expression phase and on OxyR Dam - dependent phase variation of pap and agn43 requires that Dam - dependent methylation of specific GATC sequences is prevented ( van der Woude and Baumler , 2004 ; Casadesus and Low , 2006 ) , referred to here as ` sequestration ' of the GATC sequences .

As examples of promoters mapping in HGT DNA , we selected hilA , which controls the expression of the master regulator of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 ( SPI1 ) [ 25 ] , sensitive to H - NS R27 modulation in our transcriptomic study ( see Figure 1 ) , and the E. coli hly promoter , which regulates transcription of the operon encoding the toxin a - hemolysin and that has been shown to be modulated by H - NS and Hha [ 5 ] .

Since TviA regulates its own transcription ( Hashimoto et al. , 1996 ) , the transcriptional - fusion was constructed such that the tviA coding sequence was not disrupted .	 TviA 	 tviA 	regulator
As expected , a decrease in osmolarity resulted in significantly increased transcription of tviA in S. Typhi ( Fig. 11A ) , thereby reducing the availability of TviA .	 TviA 	 tviA 	repressor
Consistent with the hypothesis , that the EnvZ / OmpR system controls expression of tviA in response to osmolarity , disruption of the envZ gene in S. Typhi increased motility to levels comparable to the ΔviaB mutant ( Fig. 11B and 11C ) .	 OmpR 	 tviA 	activator
Likewise , introducing a envZ mutation into the tviA expressing S. Typhimurium strain abrogated the TviA - mediated repression of flagellin expression and motility in response to osmolarity ( Fig. 12 ) .	 TviA 	 tviA 	repressor
Our data further suggested that RcsB in conjunction with the TviA auxiliary protein represses motility and invasion in S. Typhi by repressing the flhDC genes .	 RcsB 	 flhDC 	repressor

Because the phosphorylation of a response regulator is primarily mediated by its cognate sensor kinase , we next asked whether the RstB sensor is responsible for the acidic - pH - promoted RstA activity .

Activation of feoB transcription at acidic pH is dependent on the PhoP/PhoQ and RstA proteins but independent of the RstB protein .	 RstA 	 feoB 	activator
Western blot analysis revealed that the rstA deletion strain harboring pEN105 expressed the RstA - FLAG protein only in the presence of isopropyl - - Dthiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) , regardless of the pH of the medium ( Fig. 4A , lanes 2 and 4 ) .	 RstA 	 rstA 	repressor

It is possible that leucine 289 of the CTD is responsible for mediating an interaction with an activator other than HilD at the hilA promoter , but we find this idea unlikely for several reasons .	 HilD 	 hilA 	activator

In addition , HilD binds to the hilA promoter in an area from position 49 to 101 , which would 532 BODDICKER ET AL. .	 HilD 	 hilA 	regulator

Furthermore , if CysB binding to CBS - P1 results in an subunit contact point that is different from those used for other cys promoters , it might also be possible to isolate a cysB mutant specifically defective in cysP promoter activation .	 CysB 	 cysB 	no_relation
With our 19 - bp half - site model , binding of a CysB tetramer to an activation site would leave two subunits potentially free for interactions with other half - sites , and we believe that one of these is so employed during bending of the cysK and cysP promoters in the absence of N - acetyl - L-serine , in which binding occurs to both an activation site and part of an adjacent accessory site ( see below ) .	 CysB 	 cysK 	activator
( A ) N - acetyl - L-serine stimulation of binding when half - sites are convergent and separated by 1 to 3 bp ; ( B ) N - acetyl - L-serine inhibition of binding to sites with divergently oriented half - sites separated by one or two turns of the helix ; ( C ) regions in the cysP and cysK promoters that contain a half - site oriented toward an activation site and separated from it by 12 or 13 bp are bent by CysB but less so in the presence of N - acetyl - L-serine .	 CysB 	 cysK 	activator
A third type of half - site topography is found in the cysP and cysK promoters , in which CysB bends the DNA at an angle of approximately 100 and N - acetyl - L-serine decreases the angle to about 50 ( 17 , 18 ) .	 CysB 	 cysK 	regulator
A similar phenomenon occurs in the cysK promoter , in which a single CysB tetramer binds to CBS - K2c , CBS - K1a , and CBS - K1b in the absence of N - acetyl - L - serine ( Fig. 9C ) and bends the DNA between CBS - K2c and CBS - K1a , which are separated by 13 bp ( 17 , 31 ) .	 CysB 	 cysK 	regulator
The presence of multiple binding sites in the cysJIH promoter suggests that it too might be bent by CysB in a manner analogous to that observed for the cysK and cysP promoters .	 CysB 	 cysJIH 	repressor

Footprints showing protection of more than one binding site in the cysJIH promoter are probably the result of binding by two or more CysB tetramers , which has been observed in stoichiometric studies ( 18 ) .	 CysB 	 cysJIH 	regulator
CysB did not affect transcription from the p L promoter , which was used as a control in these experiments , but it did inhibit transcription from the cysJIH promoter , which was also used as a control because it was thought to lack a downstream CysB binding site .	 CysB 	 cysJIH 	no_relation

While autoinduction of eutR is important in maintaining an effective distribution of Ado - B12 between EutR regulatory protein and lyase , differences in the binding constants of these two proteins may also contribute to the balance between eut operon induction and ethanolamine degradation .

To find the promoter region that is necessary for PhoP activation , we cloned various fragments of the sodCI promoter 5 to a promoterless lacZ gene in pDX1 , an apramycin - resistant plasmid derived from pAH125 ( 20 ; Lin and Slauch , unpublished ) .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	activator
The most striking example is fragment H ( Fig. 8 ) , in which three base pair changes , corresponding to sites shown to be critical for PhoP activation of the mgtA promoter in E. coli ( 53 ) , completely abrogated the transcriptional activation in the phoQ24 background .	 PhoP 	 mgtA 	activator
Together with the fact that known PhoP - regulated transcriptional activators are apparently not involved in sodCI regulation , these results suggest that PhoP acts directly at the sodCI promoter .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	regulator

However , our attempts to gel shift sodCI promoter fragments by using purified His - tagged PhoP under a variety of conditions were inconclusive ( not shown ) .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	regulator
E. A. Groisman tested whether PhoP was cross - linked to the sodCI promoter in his assay ( unpublished data ) .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	activator
Thus , although our genetic data strongly argue that PhoP directly activates sodCI transcription , we have been unable to confirm direct binding using in - vitro molecular techniques .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	activator
Analysis of the PhoP consensus sequence within the sodCI promoter .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	regulator
The underlined bases are those that have been shown to be critical in PhoP binding to the mgtA promoter in E. coli ( 53 ) .	 PhoP 	 mgtA 	regulator
Alternatively , PhoP binding to the nonconsensus sodCI site is weak and is only realized under the in vivo induced conditions .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	regulator
Indeed , the start codon for the Gifsy - 2 L gene is at position 30 in the sodCI promoter and much of the putative PhoP binding site is within the L open reading frame ( Fig. 8 ) .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	regulator
For example , the ( G/T ) G in the downstream PhoP half site in the sodCI promoter is not conserved , but these nucleotides correspond to the ATG start codon for L ( Fig. 8 ) .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	activator
Thus , the phage presumably evolved to regulate the acquired sodCI gene via PhoP while maintaining the amino - acid sequence critical for L function .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	regulator
Given these constraints , sodCI has apparently evolved an imperfect PhoP binding site .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	regulator
We have been unable to prove direct binding of PhoP to the sodCI promoter in - vitro .	 PhoP 	 sodCI 	activator
